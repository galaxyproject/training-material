RNA-Seq de novo assembly data analysis
======================================

RNA-sequencing is a method used to reveal the presence and quantity of RNA in a biological sample at a given moment in time.
When no reference genome is available for the studed species, it is possible to perform an assembly of RNA-Seq data to produce a transcriptome.
Here, we propose some materials to learn how to analyze RNA-seq data using a de novo assembly strategy.

# Slides

Several deck of slides will be available for this topic...

# Tutorials

A tutorial with hands-on will be available for this topic:

- [RNA-seq de novo assembly](tutorials/de_novo.md)

## Input datasets

The input datasets for the tutorials will be soon available on Zenodo.

## Galaxy instance

For these tutorials, you can use the [dedicated Docker image](docker/README.md):

```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 bgruening/galaxy-rna-seq-assembly-training
```

It will launch a flavored Galaxy instance available on
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
