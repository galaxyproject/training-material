# GalaxyP Workflows

A collection of Galaxy Workflows to be used for proteomics analyses. Each workflow is provided as an importable `*.ga` file. A description is added to each workflow.

Some of these workflows supplement GalaxyP tutorials, which can be found [here](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/Proteomics/). Others deal with specialized techniques which are not described in detailed tutorials, yet. For those workflows we added a more detailed description in the attached `Readme.md` files.
