  - section: "Hybrid Lesson Development Guide"

      Covers an introduction to pedagogy for instructors and how to adapt training materials to hybrid methodology and key points and indicators that instructors should use when evaluating or adapting training materials to hybrid training delivery [SC5.1]

  - section: "Train the Trainer Programme"
    description: |
      This submodule consists of an in depth training of hybrid workshop delivery methodology and risk management. We will base this on existing TtT programmes such as from Carpentries and ELIXIR due to our contact with both, using open methodology to ensure significant review of the materials before publication. This will be evaluated in the first round leveraging LTTAs for the new consortium members (INRAE, MNHN). These LTTAs are not included as a dedicated cost item in the budget, as they will be online and do not require travel for the learners. Lessons learned and feedback provided during this evaluation process will be integrated back into the TtT training module, before a second round of refinement in the mentorship period [SC5.2]

  - section: "Course Builder"
    description: |
      Given the highly modular nature of the training content developed in IOs 1-4, the respective submodules can be combined and assembled into courses in different ways. Each submodule has defined prerequisite modules and suggested follow-up modules as well as a time estimate. This information can be used by instructors to "build" their own courses using these building blocks. To assist with this task, we will provide those instructors with a small web application for module selection and scheduling. [SC5.2-3]

Success Criteria:

- SC5.1) Hybrid Training Material Development. Hybrid training brings new challenges, and instructors need to be familiar with the particular issues training materials may experience in the face of hybrid training delivery.
- SC5.2) Hybrid Training Methodology. This will enable instructors to effectively host hybrid events and be prepared to address potential issues which may arise there.
- SC5.3) Transnational Training Organisation. Instructors will need instruction in the additional constraints of organising events across countries and timezones.
