title: Introduction to Galaxy and Ecological data analysis
description: |
  This learning path aims to teach you the basics of Galaxy and analysis of ecological data.
  You will learn how to use Galaxy for analysis, and will be guided through the common
  steps of biodiversity data analysis: download, check, filter and explore biodiversity data and analyze abundance data through modeling.

  - section: "Module 1: Introduction to Galaxy"
    description: |
      Get a first look at the Galaxy platform for data analysis. We start with a
      short introduction (video slides & practical) to familiarize you with the Galaxy
      interface, and then proceed with a slightly longer introduction tutorials where
      you perform a first, very simple, analysis.

  - section: "Module 2: Basics of Biodiversity data exploration"
    description: When analysing biodiversity data, you should often explore your data (and/or existing data from GBIF for example) looking at geographical, taxonomic or temporal components to clean it and make sure your data is good enough to answer your research question.

  - section: "Module 3: Basics of Biodiversity abundance data analysis"
    description: Working on abundance data, you often want to analyze it through modeling to compute and analyze biodiversity metrics.
