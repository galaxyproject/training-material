title: Building training material in Galaxy
description: |
  This learning path aims to teach you the basics of navigating the Galaxy training Github repository, and turning your ace training materials and workflows into Galaxy sites.
  For support throughout these tutorials, join our Galaxy [training network on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#Galaxy-Training-Network_Lobby:gitter.im) to ask questions!

pathway:
  - section: "Module 1: What is Github and why do I have to use it?"
    description: |
      Galaxy training material is hosted on Github. Finding these materials and getting used to the ideas of submitting a 'Pull request' is a crucial starting point for developing training material in Galaxy. You may find that [searching Github on our training materials](../search2.html?query=github) will also provide further resources on this topic after the following module.
    tutorials:
      - name: github-interface-contribution
        topic: contributing

  - section: "Module 2: Creating new material"
    description: |
      Now the fun begins! This module shows you how to turn a workflow into a tutorial skeleton, building the folders necessary in the Galaxy Github environment. Alternatively, this section shows you how to create a Galaxy-formatted slide-deck.
    tutorials:
      - name: create-new-tutorial
        topic: contributing
      - name: create-new-tutorial-slides
        topic: contributing

  - section: "Module 3: Make it pretty"
    description: |
      Now that you have your material, what does it look like in the Galaxy training site? How can you add bells and whistles, like questions or tips? How can you visualise these changes? Here, you'll find a way to render your materials and change formatting to get the most out of the training platform. You will also learn how to embed images, or even turn coding notebooks automatically into training material.
    tutorials:
      - name: gitpod
        topic: contributing
      - name: create-new-tutorial-content
        topic: contributing


  - section: "The End!"
    description: |
      And now you're done! There are still loads of resources to help you improve your training [conceptually](../learning-pathways/train-the-trainers.html) or [structurally](../topics/contributing/).
