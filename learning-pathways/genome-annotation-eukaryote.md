  - section: "Module 1: Introduction"
    description: |
      General introduction to genome annotation
    tutorials:
      - name: introduction
        topic: genome-annotation

  - section: "Module 2: Repeat Masking"
    description: |
      Learn how to identifying, and "mask", repeated regions, a first step before annotating genes
    tutorials:

  - section: "Module 3: Gene calling and functional annotation"
    description: |
      In this module you will learn to run the Funannotate tool suite to find the position of genes and to functionally annotate them. Optionally you can also identify long non-coding RNAs.

    description: |
      Automatic annotation is rarely perfect, in this module you will learn how to start a collaborative manual curation project using Galaxy and Apollo
