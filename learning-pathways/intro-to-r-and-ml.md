title: From R to Machine Learning; an introductory course
description: |
  This learning path aims to teach you the basics of Machine Learning using R.
  Initially you will learn how to code in R within the Galaxy platform, gaining some
  familiarity into how to wrangle and analyze data. Then, you will be guided through
  the various types of Machine Learning techniques, developing some simple models using R.

pathway:
  - section: "Module 1: R in Galaxy"
    description: |
      Get a first understanding of how to code using R fully using the Galaxy infrastructure.
      The first part will introduce the basic concepts of R, whereas the second part will focus
      on providing some advanced concepts around data manipulation.
    tutorials:
      - topic: data-science
        name: r-basics
      - topic: data-science
        name: r-advanced

  - section: "Module 2: Machine Learning using R"
    description:  |
      Having some foundational understanding of how to code in R, this module will provide initially
      an overview of the different types of Machine Learning, and then will provide some practical, hands-on
      examples of creating ML models.
    tutorials:
      - topic: statistics
