        name: python-iterables

  - section: "Week 3: Python is a Computer"
    description: Once you've covered basic datatypes, let's do interesting things with Python like Loops! And Flow Control! Python lets you automate calculations and tasks and we'll learn about that building block this week.
    tutorials:
      - topic: data-science

This learning path covers all the topics usually taught during our 8 week
Python course. Many modules can be re-arranged and re-organised based on the
wishes of the instructor, however this is the suggested orientation. They are
designed to be as modular as possible.
