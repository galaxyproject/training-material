DNA Methylation data analysis
=============================

DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism used by higher eukaryotes and involved in eg. gene expression, X-Chromosome inactivating, imprinting, and gene silencing of germ-line specific gene and repetitive elements.
Here, we propose some materials to learn how to analyze MethylC-seq data.

# Slides

Several deck of slides are available for this topic:

- [General introduction about DNA Methylation data analysis](http://bgruening.github.io/training-material/MethylC-Seq/slides/)

# Tutorials

A tutorial with hands-on is available for this topic:

- [MethylC-Seq data analysis](tutorials/methylc_seq.md)

## Input datasets

The input datasets for the tutorial will be available soon on Zenodo.

## Galaxy instance

For these tutorials, you can use the [dedicated Docker image](docker/README.md):

```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 bgruening/galaxy-methylc-seq-training
```

It will launch a flavored Galaxy instance available on
[http://localhost:8080 ](http://localhost:8080).
