        Title of the tutorial (it will appear on the tutorial page and the topic page)
    examples:
        - Clustering in Machine Learning

        - How does Genome assembly work?
        - How do I change Galaxy configs?
        - How to detect and quantify differentially abundant proteins in a HEK-Ecoli Benchmark DIA datatset?

        list of learning objectives for the tutorial

        A learning objective is a single sentence describing what a learner will be able to do once they have done the tutorial. Generally it is best to follow a 2C or 3C learning objective such as:

        - Compute (Skill)
        - multiple whole genome assemblies (Objective)
        - in such a way to develop big data processing skills (Result)
    examples:
        - Understand the basic concepts behind phylogenetic trees, as applied to *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*
        - Explore Biodiversity data with taxonomic, temporal and geographical informations
        - Generate a DotPlot emulating the original paper using a different analysis tool
key_points:
    type: seq
    sequence:
        - type: str
          required: true
    description: |
        List of take-home messages. This information will appear at the end
        of the tutorial. These should really be a key point, something that
        should stick in their mind; what you want them to take home from
        the tutorial.
    examples:
        - Pangeo ecosystem enables big data analysis in geosciences
        - &quot;The MiModD suite of tools bundles most of the functionality required to perform mapping-by-sequencing analyses with Galaxy&quot;
        - It can drastically simplify management of large numbers of VMs
edam_ontology:

        Link to a gitter channel that is more relevant for the tutorial than the default. E.g. a single cell tutorial could use `Galaxy-Training-Network/galaxy-single-cell` to link to their specific chat room.
    examples:
        - Galaxy-Training-Network/galaxy-single-cell

            type: str
            description: |
                If you have an alternative preamble for your notebook that students should know before following (e.g. they must load X datasets in their history), it can be listed here.

                This text will be shown in the GTN tutorial, but it will **not** be included in the notebook, giving you a bit better control over mixing setup content which is relevant for Galaxy, with notebook content that can be easy to run for students.
            examples:
                - topics/climate/tutorials/pangeo-notebook/preamble.md
        pyolite:
            type: bool
            description: |
                The GTN has support for JupyterLite and the Pyodide kernel which runs [Python in the browser via webassembly/javascript](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/). This comes with some restrictions:

                - Python only
                - No filesystem access (so no `wget` prep steps)
                - Little to no cell magic

                However, it means we can run a lot of our Python training
                directly in the GTN! And in the future, hopefully, we will
                be able to embed individual cells of the notebook directly
                in the Python training, so the user doesn&#39;t even need to
                switch pages.

                Enabling this field will enable pyolite links for this notebook.
