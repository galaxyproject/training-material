But this step is not included in the workflow, right? So, the workflow only starts with a dataset that needs to be copied to a new history if the workflow is to be applied to another dataset (i.e. genes of chr10)?

In this tutorial we will be using Map with BWA-MEM tool.\" *However* the \"Hands-on: Mapping reads\" box has the mapping tool specified as \"Map with Bowtie\". The tool name doesn't fully match a Galaxy wrapped tool but looks as if it was intended to match \"Map with Bowtie for Illumina\" tool from some earlier tutorial revision,  but the tool options/settings are actually for \"Bowtie2\" (tweak SAM/BAM output). The tuto workflow uses \"Map with BWA-MEM (Galaxy Version 0.8.0)\" which isn't available at EU or ORG (or that version is hidden in the tool panel + tool versions menu).  --------- Punchline ... three different tools are mixed up, at the first step of the tuto after loading the initial fastq inputs. Probably should adjust to make all for either Bowtie2 or BWA-MEM using a version available at EU (so it can be run there). Be nice to have this work at (at least) one of the usegalaxy.* servers :) ORG doesn't include HiC tools. Will ticket this and whatever else is found after reviewing the remainder of steps.",

This is covered well in the \"contributing\" video at the end but could have mentioned briefly at the start. More generally, it would be good to explain that `galaxy-core` has built-in tools (with no `.shed.yml` file) and that all contributed tools (like we're building) are installed from an available toolshed. - I'm not sure if I should actually be following along with all of this... should I actually make a PR for a new Bioconda package in a tutorial? It would be great to clarify what the participant should be doing NOW versus what they would do in a genuine tool wrap. Also, presumably the package sometimes exists already in Bioconda? (I used an existing conda package in my 'practice' tool wrap). - At the end of the \"Toolshed file\" section:   \"In the case where the directory represents a group of tools or a ‘suite’, there are additional overarching sections into which the above tags fall\"   ... seems to imply that parent dirs can/should have a `.shed.yml` file too? Or is it only in `suite` and `suite/tool` dirs? Would be great to clarify or provide a link to a toolshed on GitHub as an example. - \"Macros\" section: should note that whitespace inside `<token>` tags matters, and it will not be trimmed by the XML parser! (Should be picked up by the `planemo lint`)   ### Typos - `bellerophon.xml` typo under \"discover datasets\":   `directory=\"outputs\"/>>` - And \"Outputs section\" (should have closing `/>` on `<data>` according to planemo):   `<data name=\"outfile\" label=\"${tool.name} on ${on_string}\" format=\"bam\">` - \"crate an ad-hoc Galaxy\"   ### Planemo - Didn't work when `pip` installed into `conda` env (dependancy errors). `pip` install into a `virtualenv` env worked. - `pip` installing `planemo` into virtualenv requires `apt install python3-venv` as a dependancy  **Some small issues with Planemo** - `tool_test_output.html` output is a bit weird to navigate - buttons don't look like buttons (no hover effect) so most of the content is hidden until you realise there are clickable elements - `planemo serve` doesn't print the local address at the end of output (had to scroll up a few pages to find `http://127.0.0.1:9090`)",

I did not understand this. Please state it more clearly in the process if it is relevant.   The search did not often find the specific tools but gave 100 options if the name was not specific. Sometimes the full description of the tool was added at the end of instruction but in some cases it was absent which made it more difficult to find the correct tool.   The info about duplicates is messy and confusing. Either leave it our or explain/link the info about duplicates more clearly and more in relevance to the excercise.

The spacing between the sections and the fonts and colours are quite confusing. 3. The \"Use a tool\" could be more descriptive. No 3 : No change in the other parameters could be changed to \" No changes should be made on the other parameters\" . I believe thie would be easier for a user to understand. 4. I am also not sure why we have a \"Questions\" section. It deviates from teaching a user how to navigate the platform to explaining the analysis of the result. I suggest this is moved to a follow up section. 5. The icons in \"Hands-on: Re-run the tool\"  section should be updated to tally with what is currently in use. 6.
