But this step is not included in the workflow, right? So, the workflow only starts with a dataset that needs to be copied to a new history if the workflow is to be applied to another dataset (i.e. genes of chr10)? Third, when running the workflow there is that option with multiple datasets. It would have been nice to mention and explain that.",

In this tutorial we will be using Map with BWA-MEM tool.\" *However* the \"Hands-on: Mapping reads\" box has the mapping tool specified as \"Map with Bowtie\". The tool name doesn't fully match a Galaxy wrapped tool but looks as if it was intended to match \"Map with Bowtie for Illumina\" tool from some earlier tutorial revision,  but the tool options/settings are actually for \"Bowtie2\" (tweak SAM/BAM output). The tuto workflow uses \"Map with BWA-MEM (Galaxy Version 0.8.0)\" which isn't available at EU or ORG (or that version is hidden in the tool panel + tool versions menu).  --------- Punchline ... three different tools are mixed up, at the first step of the tuto after loading the initial fastq inputs. Probably should adjust to make all for either Bowtie2 or BWA-MEM using a version available at EU (so it can be run there). Be nice to have this work at (at least) one of the usegalaxy.* servers :) ORG doesn't include HiC tools. Will ticket this and whatever else is found after reviewing the remainder of steps.",

When viewing results at UCSC main, ideally it would be nice to direct audience something in particular to look for. There is a lot of data, which will definitely overwhelm my students.  This is a meta suggestion....I'm going through the introductory tutorials one by one and found this one to be more introductory than the \"peaks to genes\" tutorial.

What should it look like? Any requirements? Only the easy way is shown. How can a reference genome fasta be used along with a gff3 file? That does not work at all with files other than built in or sample files. The tutorial is meant well, but it should be improved to enable also people not working with yeast, mouse or human to use it and prevent problems. Thanks a lot!",

This is covered well in the \"contributing\" video at the end but could have mentioned briefly at the start. More generally, it would be good to explain that `galaxy-core` has built-in tools (with no `.shed.yml` file) and that all contributed tools (like we're building) are installed from an available toolshed. - I'm not sure if I should actually be following along with all of this... should I actually make a PR for a new Bioconda package in a tutorial? It would be great to clarify what the participant should be doing NOW versus what they would do in a genuine tool wrap. Also, presumably the package sometimes exists already in Bioconda? (I used an existing conda package in my 'practice' tool wrap). - At the end of the \"Toolshed file\" section:   \"In the case where the directory represents a group of tools or a âsuiteâ, there are additional overarching sections into which the above tags fall\"   ... seems to imply that parent dirs can/should have a `.shed.yml` file too? Or is it only in `suite` and `suite/tool` dirs? Would be great to clarify or provide a link to a toolshed on GitHub as an example. - \"Macros\" section: should note that whitespace inside `<token>` tags matters, and it will not be trimmed by the XML parser! (Should be picked up by the `planemo lint`)   ### Typos - `bellerophon.xml` typo under \"discover datasets\":   `directory=\"outputs\"/>>` - And \"Outputs section\" (should have closing `/>` on `<data>` according to planemo):   `<data name=\"outfile\" label=\"${tool.name} on ${on_string}\" format=\"bam\">` - \"crate an ad-hoc Galaxy\"   ### Planemo - Didn't work when `pip` installed into `conda` env (dependancy errors). `pip` install into a `virtualenv` env worked. - `pip` installing `planemo` into virtualenv requires `apt install python3-venv` as a dependancy  **Some small issues with Planemo** - `tool_test_output.html` output is a bit weird to navigate - buttons don't look like buttons (no hover effect) so most of the content is hidden until you realise there are clickable elements - `planemo serve` doesn't print the local address at the end of output (had to scroll up a few pages to find `http://127.0.0.1:9090`)",

I did not understand this. Please state it more clearly in the process if it is relevant.   The search did not often find the specific tools but gave 100 options if the name was not specific. Sometimes the full description of the tool was added at the end of instruction but in some cases it was absent which made it more difficult to find the correct tool.   The info about duplicates is messy and confusing. Either leave it our or explain/link the info about duplicates more clearly and more in relevance to the excercise.

The spacing between the sections and the fonts and colours are quite confusing. 3. The \"Use a tool\" could be more descriptive. No 3 : No change in the other parameters could be changed to \" No changes should be made on the other parameters\" . I believe thie would be easier for a user to understand. 4. I am also not sure why we have a \"Questions\" section. It deviates from teaching a user how to navigate the platform to explaining the analysis of the result. I suggest this is moved to a follow up section. 5. The icons in \"Hands-on: Re-run the tool\"  section should be updated to tally with what is currently in use. 6.

And that the goals were from the cell data from the fine needle aspiration we need to predict whether the patient has breast cancer or not. I appreciate you don't want the tutorial to be too long but perhaps using the cross table to show the positive predictive value or sensitivity and specificity and how increasing the number of clusters could improve the diagnostic accuracy.",

From a historical perspective, before 2019, there were IEs. Not super easy to deploy, but doable with motivation and investment in Docker knowledge. After launching the new ITs, IEs became progressively useless and ITs stay either nice demos or running on very few big public servers. Even the latter is not so clear: for instance, usegalaxy.org.au is not really providing ITs, usegalaxy.org (!) seems providing it at first glance, but the Rstudio interface - for instance - remains full blank forever. Only usegalaxy.eu to my knowledge provides effectively running and usable generalist ITs (Rstudio, Jupyter,). Thus, on that matter, where is the initial slogan \"data intensive analysis for everyone\" ? Of course, I am not blaming the trainers and contributors to this tutorial in any way ! But I really think that the technical strategy relying on wildcard SSL certificate to get the ITs running should be discussed with the community as a serious limitation to their use and thereby their active development. As it stands since 3 years now, ITs are out of the possibilities of a majority of Galaxy server instances because too complicated to install.",

    "pro": "The video walkthrough of how to use tools was good. Breakdown of sections with a Table of Contents to jump around was good. I like that extra detail was included, but it's so far above my head I didn't understand those at all. Thanks for the wonderful visuals, it really helps explain the relevance of each section. The beginning of the webpage and the tutorial video was actually very clear and easy to understand, it gets a bit more convoluted about halfway through and really by the end before the Nanoplot stuff (video ends before that).",
    "con": "I would have preferred if additional visual aids were used instead of just a plain screen grab. Some of the text was hard to read even on a large TV screen. Highlighting or circling or arrows, anything would help to focus the viewer's attention towards the relevant topic area. Some written aids which could be directly taken from the written webpage might be handy to sync up reading the webpage and following along with the tutorial would be nice for newbie readers who don't actually understand what's going on. An example would be just titling the section with big obvious words that match the webpage's Table of Content. And useful on screen aids like showing the buttons for pressing and holding Control OR Command with the symbols would be helpful for those following along. That's not a thing that can be demonstrated on the screen itself and can easily be overlooked as it's only mentioned for a few seconds. Then the important changes from FASTQC to MULTIQC where you must change the file input from a single file to multiple files, that right there would benefit from circling or highlighting or drawing a box around that button, maybe zooming in too. It doesn't need to be fancy Hollywood graphics here. The same video can still be used but for those few seconds that he's saying what button to press, you could use a screenshot, recorded in Powerpoint in Presentation mode with nice transitions, use the Zoom effect for each area like typing into the Upload Data section, draw a box around that button, then the Zoom back out transition to the MULTIQC options, draw a box on the button for multiple file uploads, Zoom in or out, up to you there, then return to the original video footage. I know it's simplistic, but it helps alot for new users instead of overwhelming them with a 3 panel screen with a billion options.   It would be nice if this page could easily have a printout to save as PDF and have an option for all the solution and detail boxes to either by opened or closed (useful for writing notes and testing myself before seeing the answers. It would also be nice to have details be a separate option from solutions).    I think the presenter needs to name his files better. By the end of this, he was just referring to them as \"the FASTQC file from step 17\", by this point, as a newbie, I've screwed up so much, my order doesn't match his at all, I've deleted some steps, and re-run them, and the order continues incrementing, so nothing matches his and I have no idea if I'm selecting the right files or not.   This video was really long. And I see sections that aren't included in the original for the Nanopore and long read stuff. Perhaps this would benefit from splitting the video into multiple different videos? Or adding chapters to the current one at least? Chapters corresponding to the Table of Contents names of course. This way it would improve your Youtube video's SEO and usability for users who are probably having multiple sessions watching this spread out over hours anyway. Although I think the better approach for easy future re-recording would be to split it into smaller video sections based on each Table of Contents entry. I don't see why the videos can't be directly embedded on this Training Galaxy page either, right at the top of each titled section.   I think there are too many assumptions that people should know why something should be good or bad or high or low. Even as someone with a Biology background, I haven't delved deeply into sequencing reads before and don't know how to interpret this. It would be helpful to add something like what Phoronix does for benchmarking charts with a directional arrow indicating which way is better: https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-ryzen7-6850u/8 and I suppose it could be added as video tutorial visuals or as just a labelled screenshot.   My Nanoplot attempt had an error. It would be nice if you had a built-in automated bug reporting button, either in Galaxy, or in your tutorial or just the link or wherever. Just put it somewhere and make it 100% automated so that the user doesn't need to try to figure it out. Make it somehow able to click at the step of the tutorial or report the link as broken or the results as broken. I don't get an HTML page, and I don't know why. It's a bunch of HTML code so I can tell it SHOULD BE an HTML page and the History says so, but trying to download it to read and trying to open it in Galaxy doesn't work.   On a related note, some of the buttons have changed, I think even the datasets have changed and don't match what the tutorial video shows. It would be nice if you had an updated one that matched. ",

Might probably make more sense with a screenshot, but anyway. Now, I feel like the rest of the analysis from that point was on just one of the datasets and not the collection. There's also the fact that some outputs are automatically hidden. I enjoy tinkering around knowing fully well that i won't break anything, so I don't really mind. But a complete newbie would probably get frustrated not knowing where history 16,17,18,19... disappeared to. Since this tutorial is in the introductory section, it might be helpful to acknowledge those peculiarities. Finally, maybe tell us how to visualise the vcf too? What to look for, how to know what's interesting,... I'm still looking for the nonesense mutation, but I'm sure I'll find it.  Thanks to the creators still.

    "pro": "Very interactive. Video helped when I couldn't find certain tools, the explanations were very in-depth. This was precisely the resource that a beginner like me needed (but couldn't find elsewhere) for getting started with pre-processing expression data. I am not in a genomics lab, so a tool like this is absolutely invaluable. Thank you so much!",
    "con": "A few things. 1) it was difficult to know how to search for the tools (i.e. UMI-tools extract) and I had to look at the video to understand how to access it. 2) I had to double-back from UMIs to understand why we need both cell-barcodes and transcript-barcodes. What made everything click was the statement that there are 200,000 mRNA transcripts in each cell, so one gene will produce k transcripts in the cell, and the goal of transcript-barcodes is to try to uniquely identify k. 3) Figure 1 is still a bit unclear to me. If read 1 and read 2 are performed and sequenced separately, then how does the fastq file know which read 1 is paired with which read 2? Perhaps this information is in an earlier tutorial, and I am doing this out of sequence. 4) I would like to see a bit more calculus on how 6 base pairs is enough. 4^6 = 4096, so does that mean each processing batch can handle up to 4096 cells? But the cell barcodes are designed to be far apart, so maybe it's closer 1024 cells? Also, that implies that we can capture at max 4096 transcript copies per gene, which seems like not a lot? Generally, concrete numbers like these and motivations for why only 6 base pairs are used for cell barcodes and transcript barcodes would be very insightful (maybe some people use more, maybe there are tradeoffs?). 5) Figure 1 was incredibly insightful, but still a bit abstract. I know the simplicity helps broad comprehension, but I personally wanted a single, very concrete example of an RNA sequence (with all 70 bases), because there is some ambiguity. For example, in Figure 1, what is V? Also, the article starts off talking about cDNA, but then refers to figure 1 and mRNA. It might be too tedious or pedagogical, but it would have helped (and still would help!) a complete beginner like me to understand step-by-step even the very beginning of \"this is a typical mRNA strand of length 70\", \"mRNA has a poly-A tail that is specifically targeted by a barcode containing a poly-T tail\". Something I still don't understand is how the joint complex gets sequenced. The article mentions 2 promoters (one on each end), but what happens when the mRNA gets replicated from one end, and the polymerase reaches the intersection? ",

Plus, this was my first exposure to the concept of workflows, so that's kind of life changing.",
    "con": "There were a couple of places where the software must have been updated since this was written.  At one point I spent a lot of time looking for a gear icon that is no longer used to get to the next step.  At another spot the tutorial gave you instructions for editing the workflow by clicking on the drop down menu and selecting Edit.  Now the edit button is just right there without clicking on the drop down menu.  Not a big deal, but it was confusing.  Particularly the first time I encountered it.  Learning this stuff can be overwhelming and anything you can do to make it easy is good.  ",

The issue starts with snpeff in which no genome source exists in the latest release and in which uploading the hg19 version of it is making issues due to version 5.2 grnome database. We were not able to continue with Gemini when using SnpEff eff version 4.3+T.galaxy2 and the integrated HG19 genome, only worked with 5.2+galaxy0 and download on demand the genome hg19.   Doing so, we manage to run toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/gemini_load/gemini_load/0.20.1+galaxy2 and toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/gemini_inheritance/gemini_inheritance/0.20.1 with the anticipated output.",

All of this could be broken down a bit more so that students know what they did at the end with running the saved workflow. I don't think the students understand what the final output is from this second workflow analysis.  More explanation about the repeat file and a breakdown of what the second analysis is doing would help. ",
