75,1,I like the idea of it,"It seems impossible to complete.  The training data is not available in the shared data link.  If it is, it's too hard to find.  A more general point would be to explain how the tutorial could be used on other data sets.  or ref genomes.  For this I tried using an hg19 fasta file from another data set, but got an error about indexing.  So I guess, explaining how the training data sets are pre-formatted would help when trying to use sets from other sources",,Exome sequencing data analysis for diagnosing a genetic disease,Variant Analysis,2018-11,2018-11-04
76,2,,I'm still in the middle of it.  But when doing snpEFF there is no refernece genome available.  This tutorial does not say to download one.  Other variant analyses say to download hg19.  this is not available in the shared data folders.  When using an hg19 fasta from another source freeBayes fails because it isn't indexed.  Not sure how to index it.  SnpEFF calls for a database.  I downloaded one and am trying it now.  But it would be good to include this step in the tutorial,,Calling variants in diploid systems,Variant Analysis,2018-11,2018-11-04
77,2,I like the idea,"After running the FreeBayes I ended up with 2 variants instead of 30.  And so got stuck there.  Also it's not clear why the filtering and subsequent steps would be done on the markduplicates output, rather than the left align output.  Why do the leftalign if we don't use that output again?  I did both and got the same results. Overall I am finding the galaxy experience to be rather frustrating.  I'm trying to decide whether to incorporate these tutorials in my class, but often I can't find the necessary input data, get unexplained errors, or get output different from the tutorial",,Calling variants in non-diploid systems,Variant Analysis,2018-11,2018-11-04

The only input dataset is that of the genes of chromosome 22 as far as I understood. Second, the list of genes on chr22 have in the first place been extracted from UCSC. But this step is not included in the workflow, right? So, the workflow only starts with a dataset that needs to be copied to a new history if the workflow is to be applied to another dataset (i.e. genes of chr10)? Third, when running the workflow there is that option with multiple datasets.

In this tutorial we will be using Map with BWA-MEM tool."" *However* the ""Hands-on: Mapping reads"" box has the mapping tool specified as ""Map with Bowtie"". The tool name doesn't fully match a Galaxy wrapped tool but looks as if it was intended to match ""Map with Bowtie for Illumina"" tool from some earlier tutorial revision,  but the tool options/settings are actually for ""Bowtie2"" (tweak SAM/BAM output). The tuto workflow uses ""Map with BWA-MEM (Galaxy Version 0.8.0)"" which isn't available at EU or ORG (or that version is hidden in the tool panel + tool versions menu).  --------- Punchline ... three different tools are mixed up, at the first step of the tuto after loading the initial fastq inputs. Probably should adjust to make all for either Bowtie2 or BWA-MEM using a version available at EU (so it can be run there).

They don't seem to be in the galaxy/tools/ dir? This is covered well in the ""contributing"" video at the end but could have mentioned briefly at the start. More generally, it would be good to explain that `galaxy-core` has built-in tools (with no `.shed.yml` file) and that all contributed tools (like we're building) are installed from an available toolshed. - I'm not sure if I should actually be following along with all of this... should I actually make a PR for a new Bioconda package in a tutorial? It would be great to clarify what the participant should be doing NOW versus what they would do in a genuine tool wrap. Also, presumably the package sometimes exists already in Bioconda? (I used an existing conda package in my 'practice' tool wrap). - At the end of the ""Toolshed file"" section:   ""In the case where the directory represents a group of tools or a ‘suite’, there are additional overarching sections into which the above tags fall""   ... seems to imply that parent dirs can/should have a `.shed.yml` file too? Or is it only in `suite` and `suite/tool` dirs? Would be great to clarify or provide a link to a toolshed on GitHub as an example. - ""Macros"" section: should note that whitespace inside `<token>` tags matters, and it will not be trimmed by the XML parser! (Should be picked up by the `planemo lint`)   ### Typos - `bellerophon.xml` typo under ""discover datasets"":   `directory=""outputs""/>>` - And ""Outputs section"" (should have closing `/>` on `<data>` according to planemo):   `<data name=""outfile"" label=""${tool.name} on ${on_string}"" format=""bam"">` - ""crate an ad-hoc Galaxy""   ### Planemo - Didn't work when `pip` installed into `conda` env (dependancy errors). `pip` install into a `virtualenv` env worked. - `pip` installing `planemo` into virtualenv requires `apt install python3-venv` as a dependancy  **Some small issues with Planemo** - `tool_test_output.html` output is a bit weird to navigate - buttons don't look like buttons (no hover effect) so most of the content is hidden until you realise there are clickable elements - `planemo serve` doesn't print the local address at the end of output (had to scroll up a few pages to find `http://127.0.0.1:9090`)",,Creating Galaxy tools from Conda Through Deployment,Development in Galaxy,2021-07,2021-07-01

I appreciate that a lot of information was included in this tutorial, however I believe that the page could be improved to engage a reader more. The spacing between the sections and the fonts and colours are quite confusing. 3. The ""Use a tool"" could be more descriptive. No 3 : No change in the other parameters could be changed to "" No changes should be made on the other parameters"" . I believe thie would be easier for a user to understand. 4. I am also not sure why we have a ""Questions"" section. It deviates from teaching a user how to navigate the platform to explaining the analysis of the result. I suggest this is moved to a follow up section. 5. The icons in ""Hands-on: Re-run the tool""  section should be updated to tally with what is currently in use. 6.

Also - it should be stated that there may be a newer version of the playbook that could solve errors/conflicts with newer operating system versions than those used in the tutorial.    Also suggest highlighting parts in the code examples which should be customized to your server environment if you are using this as a guide to setup your own installation (primarily directories where stuff is located).

I found that the version of galaxyproject.galaxy used in the tutorial-- version: 0.9.16 was incompatible with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS - resulting in a failure to install ""futures"".

I didn't realise till after looking at the source link that the measurements were from fine-needle biopsies of breast lesions, and the measurements were of cell nucleus radius, (I thought originally it might have been referring to tumour radius in mm). And that the goals were from the cell data from the fine needle aspiration we need to predict whether the patient has breast cancer or not.

1890,3,The interactive tools perspective,"The requirement for wildcard SSL certificate and the poor support for fulfilling this requirement. This is a major issue for the deployment of Galaxy servers. From a historical perspective, before 2019, there were IEs. Not super easy to deploy, but doable with motivation and investment in Docker knowledge. After launching the new ITs, IEs became progressively useless and ITs stay either nice demos or running on very few big public servers. Even the latter is not so clear: for instance, usegalaxy.org.au is not really providing ITs, usegalaxy.org (!) seems providing it at first glance, but the Rstudio interface - for instance - remains full blank forever. Only usegalaxy.eu to my knowledge provides effectively running and usable generalist ITs (Rstudio, Jupyter,). Thus, on that matter, where is the initial slogan ""data intensive analysis for everyone"" ? Of course, I am not blaming the trainers and contributors to this tutorial in any way ! But I really think that the technical strategy relying on wildcard SSL certificate to get the ITs running should be discussed with the community as a serious limitation to their use and thereby their active development. As it stands since 3 years now, ITs are out of the possibilities of a majority of Galaxy server instances because too complicated to install.",,Galaxy Interactive Tools,Galaxy Server administration,2022-06,2022-06-08

2006,4,"The video walkthrough of how to use tools was good. Breakdown of sections with a Table of Contents to jump around was good. I like that extra detail was included, but it's so far above my head I didn't understand those at all. Thanks for the wonderful visuals, it really helps explain the relevance of each section. The beginning of the webpage and the tutorial video was actually very clear and easy to understand, it gets a bit more convoluted about halfway through and really by the end before the Nanoplot stuff (video ends before that).","I would have preferred if additional visual aids were used instead of just a plain screen grab. Some of the text was hard to read even on a large TV screen. Highlighting or circling or arrows, anything would help to focus the viewer's attention towards the relevant topic area. Some written aids which could be directly taken from the written webpage might be handy to sync up reading the webpage and following along with the tutorial would be nice for newbie readers who don't actually understand what's going on. An example would be just titling the section with big obvious words that match the webpage's Table of Content. And useful on screen aids like showing the buttons for pressing and holding Control OR Command with the symbols would be helpful for those following along. That's not a thing that can be demonstrated on the screen itself and can easily be overlooked as it's only mentioned for a few seconds. Then the important changes from FASTQC to MULTIQC where you must change the file input from a single file to multiple files, that right there would benefit from circling or highlighting or drawing a box around that button, maybe zooming in too. It doesn't need to be fancy Hollywood graphics here. The same video can still be used but for those few seconds that he's saying what button to press, you could use a screenshot, recorded in Powerpoint in Presentation mode with nice transitions, use the Zoom effect for each area like typing into the Upload Data section, draw a box around that button, then the Zoom back out transition to the MULTIQC options, draw a box on the button for multiple file uploads, Zoom in or out, up to you there, then return to the original video footage. I know it's simplistic, but it helps alot for new users instead of overwhelming them with a 3 panel screen with a billion options.   It would be nice if this page could easily have a printout to save as PDF and have an option for all the solution and detail boxes to either by opened or closed (useful for writing notes and testing myself before seeing the answers. It would also be nice to have details be a separate option from solutions).    I think the presenter needs to name his files better. By the end of this, he was just referring to them as ""the FASTQC file from step 17"", by this point, as a newbie, I've screwed up so much, my order doesn't match his at all, I've deleted some steps, and re-run them, and the order continues incrementing, so nothing matches his and I have no idea if I'm selecting the right files or not.   This video was really long. And I see sections that aren't included in the original for the Nanopore and long read stuff. Perhaps this would benefit from splitting the video into multiple different videos? Or adding chapters to the current one at least? Chapters corresponding to the Table of Contents names of course. This way it would improve your Youtube video's SEO and usability for users who are probably having multiple sessions watching this spread out over hours anyway. Although I think the better approach for easy future re-recording would be to split it into smaller video sections based on each Table of Contents entry. I don't see why the videos can't be directly embedded on this Training Galaxy page either, right at the top of each titled section.   I think there are too many assumptions that people should know why something should be good or bad or high or low. Even as someone with a Biology background, I haven't delved deeply into sequencing reads before and don't know how to interpret this. It would be helpful to add something like what Phoronix does for benchmarking charts with a directional arrow indicating which way is better: https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-ryzen7-6850u/8 and I suppose it could be added as video tutorial visuals or as just a labelled screenshot.   My Nanoplot attempt had an error. It would be nice if you had a built-in automated bug reporting button, either in Galaxy, or in your tutorial or just the link or wherever. Just put it somewhere and make it 100% automated so that the user doesn't need to try to figure it out. Make it somehow able to click at the step of the tutorial or report the link as broken or the results as broken. I don't get an HTML page, and I don't know why. It's a bunch of HTML code so I can tell it SHOULD BE an HTML page and the History says so, but trying to download it to read and trying to open it in Galaxy doesn't work.   On a related note, some of the buttons have changed, I think even the datasets have changed and don't match what the tutorial video shows. It would be nice if you had an updated one that matched.

Really good tutorial.,"There were icons explained in the tutorial that I don't see in my computer (e.g. show histories, I only see it when I open the tab, which again have a different icon than the one in the tutorial), I guess is a difference etween different galaxies (EU, AU, USA) or differences to older version and it confused me a bit.

2060,5,"I like that you demonstrate several steps to assess the quality of the data, provide ranges of acceptable values, and explain why other values would not be acceptable. You also provide several strategies to attain the same result such as when you explain determining strandedness.  I plan on using this tutorial for my upcoming bacterial transcriptomics course.","I was confused by the explanation of the strandedness, while I understand how transcription work, I did not understand the results of unstranded, same strand and reverse strand, for the same library preparation. i was expecting only one possible result, either unstranded OR same strand OR reverse strand, but MultiQC was providing all the values for the same sample.  I also was confused by the ""Details: The counts obtained in the previous part may be different from the one imported"" as according to https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/ref-based/tutorial.html#counting-reads-per-genes, you asked us to set the featureCounts to “""Count fragments instead of reads”: Enabled; fragments (or templates) will be counted instead of reads"". But in the ""Details"" box you state that we used the ""Disabled"" option. I thought we had used the ""Enabled"" option.   Is there a tutorial similar to this one for bacterial RNA-seq analysis? Or which aligner would you recommend that I use for Bacterial transcriptomics, given that there is no splicing involved? Do you have a tutorial for bacterial transcriptomics analysis of Nanopore data?  Thank you again. ",,Reference-based RNA-Seq data analysis,Transcriptomics,2023-01,2023-01-19
