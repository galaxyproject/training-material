    "Clustering is a useful tool to detect transmission links between patients and oubreak investigation.",
    "Clustering can be used to investigate the transmission of certain traits, like drug resistance.",
    "Clustering does not provide information about particular transmission events nor their directionality (who infected whom).",
    "Clustering is very much influenced by sampling. Lower sampling proportions and shorter sampling timeframes lead to lower clustering rates that shoud not be confounded with lack of transmission."
