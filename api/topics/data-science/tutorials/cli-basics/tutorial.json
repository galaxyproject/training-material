The extension isn't required, and doesn't guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file.","Depending on the type of work you do, you may need a more powerful text editor than Nano."],"notebook":{"language":"bash"},"subtopic":"bash","contributions":{"authorship":["carpentries","hexylena","bazante1","avans-atgm"],"funding":["gallantries"]},"tags":["bash","jupyter-notebook"],"js_requirements":{"mathjax":null,"mermaid":false},"short_id":"T00076","symlink":null,"url":"/topics/data-science/tutorials/cli-basics/tutorial.html","topic_name":"data-science","tutorial_name":"cli-basics","dir":"topics/data-science/tutorials/cli-basics","id":"data-science/cli-basics","hands_on":true,"slides":false,"mod_date":"2024-10-15 12:19:56 +0000","pub_date":"2021-09-30 08:53:07 +0000","version":10,"api":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/topics/data-science/tutorials/cli-basics/tutorial.json","tools":[],"supported_servers":{"exact":[],"inexact":[{"name":"UseGalaxy.eu","url":"https://usegalaxy.eu","id":"eu","human":"Galaxy Europe","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.org","url":"https://usegalaxy.org","id":"us","human":"Galaxy Main","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.org.au","url":"https://usegalaxy.org.au","id":"au","human":"Galaxy Australia","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.fr","url":"https://usegalaxy.fr","id":"fr","human":"Galaxy France","usegalaxy":true}]},"supported_servers_matrix":{"servers":[],"tools":[]},"topic_name_human":"Foundations of Data Science","admin_install":{"install_tool_dependencies":true,"install_repository_dependencies":true,"install_resolver_dependencies":true,"tools":[]},"admin_install_yaml":"---\ninstall_tool_dependencies: true\ninstall_repository_dependencies: true\ninstall_resolver_dependencies: true\ntools: []\n","tours":false,"video":false,"slides_recordings":false,"translations":{"tutorial":[],"slides":[],"video":false},"license":"CC-BY-4.0","type":"tutorial","contributors":[{"name":"The Carpentries","joined":"2021-09","ror":"0356fgm10","id":"carpentries","url":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/organisations/carpentries.json","page":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/carpentries/"},{"name":"Helena Rasche","orcid":"0000-0001-9760-8992","maintainer_contact":"gitter","matrix":"hexylena:matrix.org","joined":"2017-09","elixir_node":"nl","affiliations":["erasmusmc","gallantries","by-covid","elixir-europe","elixir-converge"],"former_affiliations":["deNBI","avans-atgm","uni-freiburg"],"contact_for_training":false,"location":{"country":"NL","lat":51.91,"lon":4.46},"id":"hexylena","url":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/contributors/hexylena.json","page":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/hexylena/"},{"name":"Bazante Sanders","joined":"2020-12","affiliations":["avans-atgm"],"id":"bazante1","url":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/contributors/bazante1.json","page":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/bazante1/"},{"short_name":"Avans","name":"Avans Hogeschool","joined":"2020-11","url":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/organisations/avans-atgm.json","avatar":"/training-material/shared/images/logo-avans.png","ror":"015d5s513","members":["bazante1"],"former_members":["dirowa","hexylena"],"id":"avans-atgm","page":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/avans-atgm/"},{"name":"Gallantries: Bridging Training Communities in Life Science, Environment and Health","short_name":"Gallantries","start_date":"2020-09-01","end_date":"2023-09-30","joined":"2020-09","avatar":"https://gallantries.github.io/assets/images/gallantries-logo.png","github":false,"url":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/grants/gallantries.json","funder_name":"Erasmus+ Programme","funding_id":"2020-1-NL01-KA203-064717","funding_database":"erasmusplus","funding_statement":"This project (<a href=\"https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/projects/search/details/2020-1-NL01-KA203-064717\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">2020-1-NL01-KA203-064717</code></a>) is funded with the support of the Erasmus+ programme of the European Union.
