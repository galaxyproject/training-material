can I combine existing commands to do new things?","How can I perform the same actions on many different files?","How can I find files?","How can I find things in files?"],"objectives":["Redirect a command's output to a file.","Process a file instead of keyboard input using redirection.","Construct command pipelines with two or more stages.","Explain what usually happens if a program or pipeline isn't given any input to process.","Explain Unix's 'small pieces, loosely joined' philosophy.","Write a loop that applies one or more commands separately to each file in a set of files.","Trace the values taken on by a loop variable during execution of the loop.","Explain the difference between a variable's name and its value.","Explain why spaces and some punctuation characters shouldn't be used in file names.","Demonstrate how to see what commands have recently been executed.","Re-run recently executed commands without retyping them.","Use `grep` to select lines from text files that match simple patterns.","Use `find` to find files and directories whose names match simple patterns.","Use the output of one command as the command-line argument(s) to another command.","Explain what is meant by 'text' and 'binary' files, and why many common tools don't handle the latter well."],"time_estimation":"2H","key_points":["`wc` counts lines, words, and characters in its inputs.","`cat` displays the contents of its inputs.","`sort` sorts its inputs.","`head` displays the first 10 lines of its input.","`tail` displays the last 10 lines of its input.","`command > [file]` redirects a command's output to a file (overwriting any existing content).","`command >> [file]` appends a command's output to a file.","`[first] | [second]` is a pipeline: the output of the first command is used as the input to the second.","The best way to use the shell is to use pipes to combine simple single-purpose programs (filters).","A `for` loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list.","Every `for` loop needs a variable to refer to the thing it is currently operating on.","Use `$name` to expand a variable (i.e., get its value). `${name}` can also be used.","Do not use spaces, quotes, or wildcard characters such as '*' or '?' in filenames, as it complicates variable expansion.","Give files consistent names that are easy to match with wildcard patterns to make it easy to select them for looping.","Use the up-arrow key to scroll up through previous commands to edit and repeat them.","Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to search through the previously entered commands.","Use `history` to display recent commands, and `![number]` to repeat a command by number.","`find` finds files with specific properties that match patterns.","`grep` selects lines in files that match patterns.","`--help` is an option supported by many bash commands, and programs that can be run from within Bash, to display more information on how to use these commands or programs.","`man [command]` displays the manual page for a given command.","`$([command])` inserts a command's output in place."],"notebook":{"language":"bash"},"subtopic":"bash","contributions":{"authorship":["carpentries","hexylena","bazante1","avans-atgm"],"funding":["gallantries"]},"tags":["bash","jupyter-notebook"],"js_requirements":{"mathjax":null,"mermaid":false},"short_id":"T00074","symlink":null,"url":"/topics/data-science/tutorials/cli-advanced/tutorial.html","topic_name":"data-science","tutorial_name":"cli-advanced","dir":"topics/data-science/tutorials/cli-advanced","id":"data-science/cli-advanced","hands_on":true,"slides":false,"mod_date":"2024-10-15
