    "Use `conda install` to install and manage additional external (third-party) libraries.",
    "Conda allows you to declare all dependencies for a project in a separate file (by convention called `environment.yml`) which can be shared with collaborators/users and used to replicate an environment.",
    "Use `conda env export > environment.yml` to take snapshot of your project's dependencies.",
    "Use `conda env create -f environment.yml` to replicate someone else's environment on your machine from the `environment.yml` file."
