    "Is the structured approach to course design?",

    "List five key phases of curriculum & course development",
    "Explain the primary role of learning outcomes",
    "Write learning outcomes for a course",

    "Summarise the benefits of course evaluation"
  ],
  "key_points": [
    "Course development is a multi-step, iterative process",
    "The first step is to identify intended (SMART) LOs",
    "Identification  of  key  content  only  becomes  relevant  after  LOs  & suitable LEs have been identified",
    "Bloom's taxonomy can facilitate the articulation of measurable LOs, & support the development of cognitive complexity through them",
    "Messick's questions help to align KSAs, instruction & assessment",
    "For  successful  outcomes,  learners  &  the  course  must  be  evaluated (it isn't sufficient simply to note 'completers' or learner satisfaction)",
    "A successful course guides learners from entry-level performance to the minimum performance level for achieving its target LOs",
    "In a course designed to support learners & LOs, the instruction that's delivered & learning that's intended are more likely to align, thereby providing the optimal circumstances for learner success."
