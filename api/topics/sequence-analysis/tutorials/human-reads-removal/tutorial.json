    "Before submitting raw viral sequencing data to public databases you will want to remove human sequence traces",
    "Human reads can be identified by mapping the data to the human reference genome",
    "After mapping, you can extract the read identifiers of the non-human reads and use these to extract just the desired original sequenced reads from the input data"
