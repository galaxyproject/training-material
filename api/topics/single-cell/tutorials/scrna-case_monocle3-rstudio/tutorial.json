(R)","subtopic":"single-cell-CS-code","priority":4,"zenodo_link":"https://zenodo.org/record/7455590","questions":["How do I perform a trajectory analysis using Monocle3 in R?","What should I do when Galaxy's Monocle tools are not enough?","How do I assign cell types to the clusters?","How do I infer lineage relationships between clusters, without a time series?","How do I perform batch correction and differential expression analysis in Monocle?"],"objectives":["Identify which operations are necessary to transform an AnnData object into the files needed for Monocle","Describe the Monocle3 functions in R","Recognise steps that can be performed in R, but not with current Galaxy tools","Repeat the Monocle3 workflow and choose appropriate parameter values","Compare the outputs from Scanpy, Monocle in Galaxy and Monocle in R","Describe differential expression analysis methods"],"time_estimation":"3H","key_points":["Monocle3 in R gives more flexibility when it comes to differential expression analysis and plotting, but Galaxy offers great reproducibility and ease of analysis.","Comparing the output of several different methods applied on the same dataset might be useful to confirm the results, to ensure that the findings are reliable and even sometimes to find a new piece of information."],"requirements":[{"type":"internal","topic_name":"single-cell","tutorials":["scrna-case_alevin","scrna-case_alevin-combine-datasets","scrna-case_basic-pipeline"]}],"tags":["10x","paper-replication","R","MIGHTS","rmarkdown-notebook","jupyter-notebook"],"contributions":{"authorship":["wee-snufkin"],"editing":["hexylena","pavanvidem","nomadscientist"],"funding":["eosc-life"]},"notebook":{"language":"r","snippet":"topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_monocle3-rstudio/preamble.md"},"js_requirements":{"mathjax":null,"mermaid":false},"short_id":"T00336","symlink":null,"url":"/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_monocle3-rstudio/tutorial.html","topic_name":"single-cell","tutorial_name":"scrna-case_monocle3-rstudio","dir":"topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_monocle3-rstudio","id":"single-cell/scrna-case_monocle3-rstudio","hands_on":true,"slides":false,"mod_date":"2024-10-28
