      "description": "Single-cell RNA sequencing can be sensitive to both biological and technical variation,   i\nwhich is why preparing your data carefully is an important part of the analysis. You want\nthe results to reflect the interesting differences in expression between cells that relate\nto their type or state. Other sources of variation can conceal or confound this, making it\nharder for you to see what is going on.\n\nOne common biological confounder is the cell cycle. Cells express\ndifferent genes during different parts of the cell cycle, depending on whether they are in\ntheir growing phase (G1), duplicating their DNA (the S or Synthesis phase), or dividing in\ntwo (G2/M or Mitosis phase). If these cell cycle genes are having a big impact on your\ndata, then you could end up with separate clusters that actually represent cells of the\nsame type that are just at different stages of the cycle.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will identify the genes whose expression is known to vary during the\ncell cycle so that we can use them to regress out (or remove) the effects of the cell cycle\non the clustering.\n",
