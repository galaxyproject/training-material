      "description": "Workflow of Tutorial \"Single-cell ATAC-seq standard processing with SnapATAC2\".\nThis workflow takes a fragment file as input and performs the standard steps of scATAC-seq analysis: filtering, dimension reduction, embedding and visualization of marker genes with SnapATAC2.\nIn an alternative step, the fragment file can also be generated from a BAM file. \n\n## Associated Tutorial\n\nThis workflows is part of the tutorial [Single-cell ATAC-seq standard processing with SnapATAC2](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scatac-standard-processing-snapatac2/tutorial.html), available in the [GTN](https://training.galaxyproject.org)\n\n## Features\n\n* Includes [Galaxy Workflow Tests](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/gtn/workflow_run_test.html)\n* Includes a [Galaxy Workflow Report](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/workflows_report_view.html)\n* Uses [Galaxy Workflow Comments](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/workflows_comments.html)\n\n## Thanks to...\n\n**Workflow Author(s)**: Timon Schlegel\n\n**Tutorial Author(s)**: [Timon Schlegel](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/timonschlegel/)\n\n**Tutorial Contributor(s)**: [Pavankumar Videm](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/pavanvidem/), [Björn Grüning](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/bgruening/)\n\n[![gtn star logo followed by the word workflows](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/assets/branding/gtn-workflows.png)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/)",
