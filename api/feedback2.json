Breakdown of sections with a Table of Contents to jump around was good. I like that extra detail was included, but it's so far above my head I didn't understand those at all. Thanks for the wonderful visuals, it really helps explain the relevance of each section. The beginning of the webpage and the tutorial video was actually very clear and easy to understand, it gets a bit more convoluted about halfway through and really by the end before the Nanoplot stuff (video ends before that).","con":"I would have preferred if additional visual aids were used instead of just a plain screen grab. Some of the text was hard to read even on a large TV screen. Highlighting or circling or arrows, anything would help to focus the viewer's attention towards the relevant topic area. Some written aids which could be directly taken from the written webpage might be handy to sync up reading the webpage and following along with the tutorial would be nice for newbie readers who don't actually understand what's going on. An example would be just titling the section with big obvious words that match the webpage's Table of Content. And useful on screen aids like showing the buttons for pressing and holding Control OR Command with the symbols would be helpful for those following along. That's not a thing that can be demonstrated on the screen itself and can easily be overlooked as it's only mentioned for a few seconds. Then the important changes from FASTQC to MULTIQC where you must change the file input from a single file to multiple files, that right there would benefit from circling or highlighting or drawing a box around that button, maybe zooming in too. It doesn't need to be fancy Hollywood graphics here. The same video can still be used but for those few seconds that he's saying what button to press, you could use a screenshot, recorded in Powerpoint in Presentation mode with nice transitions, use the Zoom effect for each area like typing into the Upload Data section, draw a box around that button, then the Zoom back out transition to the MULTIQC options, draw a box on the button for multiple file uploads, Zoom in or out, up to you there, then return to the original video footage. I know it's simplistic, but it helps alot for new users instead of overwhelming them with a 3 panel screen with a billion options.   It would be nice if this page could easily have a printout to save as PDF and have an option for all the solution and detail boxes to either by opened or closed (useful for writing notes and testing myself before seeing the answers. It would also be nice to have details be a separate option from solutions).    I think the presenter needs to name his files better. By the end of this, he was just referring to them as \"the FASTQC file from step 17\", by this point, as a newbie, I've screwed up so much, my order doesn't match his at all, I've deleted some steps, and re-run them, and the order continues incrementing, so nothing matches his and I have no idea if I'm selecting the right files or not.   This video was really long. And I see sections that aren't included in the original for the Nanopore and long read stuff. Perhaps this would benefit from splitting the video into multiple different videos? Or adding chapters to the current one at least? Chapters corresponding to the Table of Contents names of course. This way it would improve your Youtube video's SEO and usability for users who are probably having multiple sessions watching this spread out over hours anyway. Although I think the better approach for easy future re-recording would be to split it into smaller video sections based on each Table of Contents entry. I don't see why the videos can't be directly embedded on this Training Galaxy page either, right at the top of each titled section.   I think there are too many assumptions that people should know why something should be good or bad or high or low. Even as someone with a Biology background, I haven't delved deeply into sequencing reads before and don't know how to interpret this. It would be helpful to add something like what Phoronix does for benchmarking charts with a directional arrow indicating which way is better: https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-ryzen7-6850u/8 and I suppose it could be added as video tutorial visuals or as just a labelled screenshot.   My Nanoplot attempt had an error. It would be nice if you had a built-in automated bug reporting button, either in Galaxy, or in your tutorial or just the link or wherever. Just put it somewhere and make it 100% automated so that the user doesn't need to try to figure it out. Make it somehow able to click at the step of the tutorial or report the link as broken or the results as broken. I don't get an HTML page, and I don't know why. It's a bunch of HTML code so I can tell it SHOULD BE an HTML page and the History says so, but trying to download it to read and trying to open it in Galaxy doesn't work.   On a related note, some of the buttons have changed, I think even the datasets have changed and don't match what the tutorial video shows. It would be nice if you had an updated one that matched.

After launching the new ITs, IEs became progressively useless and ITs stay either nice demos or running on very few big public servers. Even the latter is not so clear: for instance, usegalaxy.org.au is not really providing ITs, usegalaxy.org (!) seems providing it at first glance, but the Rstudio interface - for instance - remains full blank forever. Only usegalaxy.eu to my knowledge provides effectively running and usable generalist ITs (Rstudio, Jupyter,). Thus, on that matter, where is the initial slogan \"data intensive analysis for everyone\" ? Of course, I am not blaming the trainers and contributors to this tutorial in any way ! But I really think that the technical strategy relying on wildcard SSL certificate to get the ITs running should be discussed with the community as a serious limitation to their use and thereby their active development.

I am not in a genomics lab, so a tool like this is absolutely invaluable. Thank you so much!","con":"A few things. 1) it was difficult to know how to search for the tools (i.e. UMI-tools extract) and I had to look at the video to understand how to access it. 2) I had to double-back from UMIs to understand why we need both cell-barcodes and transcript-barcodes. What made everything click was the statement that there are 200,000 mRNA transcripts in each cell, so one gene will produce k transcripts in the cell, and the goal of transcript-barcodes is to try to uniquely identify k. 3) Figure 1 is still a bit unclear to me. If read 1 and read 2 are performed and sequenced separately, then how does the fastq file know which read 1 is paired with which read 2? Perhaps this information is in an earlier tutorial, and I am doing this out of sequence. 4) I would like to see a bit more calculus on how 6 base pairs is enough. 4^6 = 4096, so does that mean each processing batch can handle up to 4096 cells? But the cell barcodes are designed to be far apart, so maybe it's closer 1024 cells? Also, that implies that we can capture at max 4096 transcript copies per gene, which seems like not a lot? Generally, concrete numbers like these and motivations for why only 6 base pairs are used for cell barcodes and transcript barcodes would be very insightful (maybe some people use more, maybe there are tradeoffs?). 5) Figure 1 was incredibly insightful, but still a bit abstract. I know the simplicity helps broad comprehension, but I personally wanted a single, very concrete example of an RNA sequence (with all 70 bases), because there is some ambiguity.

They don't seem to be in the galaxy/tools/ dir? This is covered well in the \"contributing\" video at the end but could have mentioned briefly at the start. More generally, it would be good to explain that `galaxy-core` has built-in tools (with no `.shed.yml` file) and that all contributed tools (like we're building) are installed from an available toolshed. - I'm not sure if I should actually be following along with all of this... should I actually make a PR for a new Bioconda package in a tutorial? It would be great to clarify what the participant should be doing NOW versus what they would do in a genuine tool wrap. Also, presumably the package sometimes exists already in Bioconda? (I used an existing conda package in my 'practice' tool wrap). - At the end of the \"Toolshed file\" section:   \"In the case where the directory represents a group of tools or a âsuiteâ, there are additional overarching sections into which the above tags fall\"   ... seems to imply that parent dirs can/should have a `.shed.yml` file too? Or is it only in `suite` and `suite/tool` dirs? Would be great to clarify or provide a link to a toolshed on GitHub as an example. - \"Macros\" section: should note that whitespace inside `<token>` tags matters, and it will not be trimmed by the XML parser! (Should be picked up by the `planemo lint`)   ### Typos - `bellerophon.xml` typo under \"discover datasets\":   `directory=\"outputs\"/>>` - And \"Outputs section\" (should have closing `/>` on `<data>` according to planemo):   `<data name=\"outfile\" label=\"${tool.name} on ${on_string}\" format=\"bam\">` - \"crate an ad-hoc Galaxy\"   ### Planemo - Didn't work when `pip` installed into `conda` env (dependancy errors). `pip` install into a `virtualenv` env worked. - `pip` installing `planemo` into virtualenv requires `apt install python3-venv` as a dependancy  **Some small issues with Planemo** - `tool_test_output.html` output is a bit weird to navigate - buttons don't look like buttons (no hover effect) so most of the content is hidden until you realise there are clickable elements - `planemo serve` doesn't print the local address at the end of output (had to scroll up a few pages to find `http://127.0.0.1:9090`)","date":"2021-07-01","lang":null},{"rating":5,"pro":"As usal, the step by step procedures.","con":"It is not clear that we have to set up the test-data folder and collect the bam files by our own for passing the test in the planemo section.","date":"2022-02-21","lang":null},{"rating":4,"pro":"clear for a beginner","con":"maybe planemo could be the first step, because needed in the wrapper section","date":"2022-03-15","lang":null},{"rating":4,"pro":"Explanations on how to create a galaxy tool","con":"Put planemo install first","date":"2022-03-15","lang":null},{"rating":5,"pro":"Comprehensive","con":"end data tag is missing in outputs section , xml will fail to lint","date":"2023-07-11","lang":null}],"bioblend-api":[{"rating":3,"pro":null,"con":"- (Maybe just me) Too much content, too fast. - Account on a production Galaxy instance is required.
