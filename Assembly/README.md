Assembly
==========

DNA sequence data has become an indispensable tool for:
* Molecular biology
* Evolutionary Biology

However, for most of these analyses, we need a genome sequence to work from.
* We call this a “Reference Sequence”
* We need to build a reference for each species.

Assembly is the process of taking DNA sequence data in the form of reads and reconstructing likely large contiguous segments of the original DNA. Presented here are an example Galaxy tutorial for the assembly of an E.coli genome from some Illumina sequence data and ....

# Slides

Several deck of slides are available for this topic:

- [General introduction about De Novo Assembly](http://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/templates/slides/denovo_assembly.html)
- Slide deck related to the tutorials:

# Tutorials

Several tutorial with hands-on are available for this topic:

- [Tutorial name](tutorials/tutorial.md)

## Input datasets

*Zenodo DOI badge, e.g. [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.60520.svg)](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.60520)*

The input datasets for the tutorials are available on
[Zenodo with a dedicated DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.60520).

## Galaxy instance

For these tutorials, you can use the dedicated Docker image:

```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 <name-of-docker-image>
```

It will launch a flavored Galaxy instance available on
[http://localhost:8080 ](http://localhost:8080).
