    questions:
    - How to control quality of NGS data?
    - What are the quality parameters to check for each dataset?
    - How to improve the quality of a sequence dataset?

    objectives:
    - Manipulate FastQ files
    - Control quality from a FastQ file
    - Use FastQC tool
    - Understand FastQC output
    - Use tools for quality correction

    requirements:

    time_estimation: "1d/3h/6h"

    key_points:
    - Run quality control on every dataset before running any other bioinformatics analysis
    - Take care of the parameters used to improve the sequence quality
    - Re-run FastQC to check the impact of the quality control
