    questions:
    - How is raw ChIP-seq data processed and analyzed?
    - What are the binding sites of Tal1?
    - Which genes are regulated by Tal1?
    
    objectives:
    - Inspect read quality with FastQC
    - Perform read trimming with Trimmomatic
    - Align trimmed reads with BWA
    - Assess quality and reproducibility of experiments
    - Identify Tal1 binding sites with MACS2
    - Determine unique/common Tal1 binding sites from G1E and Megakaryocytes
    - Identify unique/common Tal1 peaks occupying gene promoters
    - Visually inspect Tal1 peaks with Trackster

    key_points:
    - Sophisticated analysis of ChIP-seq data is possible using tools hosted by Galaxy
    - Genomic dataset analyses require multiple methods of quality assessment to ensure that the data are appropriate for answering the biology question of interest.
    - By using the sharable and transparent Galaxy platform, data analyses can easily be shared and reproduced
