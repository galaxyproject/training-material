  2. Overview of the graphical user interface

  3. Instructions to preconfigure iSEE apps


  The hands-on lab comprises three parts:

  1. Inspection of single-cell RNA-seq data at various steps of a typical

  computational workflow, including quality control and dimensionality reduction

  2. Addition of custom panels to the user interface for advanced visualization.

  3. Additional questions from the participants, including individual use cases

  and suggestions for future developments

description: 'Concepts of causal inference in epidemiology have important ramifications

  for studies across bioinformatics and other fields of health research. In

  this workshop, we introduce basic concepts of epidemiology, study design,

  and causal inference for bioinformaticians. Emphasis is placed on addressing

  bias and confounding as common threats to assessing a causal pathway in a

  variety of study design types and when using common forms of analyses such

  as GWAS and survival analysis. Workshop participants will have the

  opportunity to create their own structural causal models (DAGs) using

  dagitty and ggdag and then use this model to determine how to assess an

  estimated causal effect. Examples using DESeq2, edgeR, and limma will be

  used to show how multivariable models can be fitted depending on the

  hypothesized causal relationship. Presented successfully at BioC2021 to a

  large audience of more than 100, updates that material by revising current

  examples based on participant feedback as well as content updates.

description: 'This tutorial will showcase analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data

  following the tidy data paradigm. The tidy data paradigm provides a standard

  way to organise data values within a dataset, where each variable is a column,

  each observation is a row, and data is manipulated using an easy-to-understand

  vocabulary. Most importantly, the data structure remains consistent across

  manipulation and analysis functions.


  This can be achieved with the integration of packages present in the R CRAN

  and Bioconductor ecosystem, including tidySingleCellExperiment and tidyverse.

  These packages are part of the tidytranscriptomics suite that introduces a

  tidy approach to RNA sequencing data representation and analysis. For more

description: "This workshop will introduce users to the NanoString R package\nSpatialOmicsOverlay.
  This package is designed for use in interpretation and\npresentation of the multi-form
  data generated by NanoString's GeoMx \xAE\nDigital Spatial Profiler spatial biology
  platform. The GeoMx DSP produces\nboth rich imaging and genomics data. Integrating
  these data types\nfacilitates a deep understanding of the profiled tissue. The\nSpatialOmicsOverlay
  package integrates both of these data types, thereby by\nmaintaining the relationship
  between underlying tissue morphology and\nresultant gene expression.\n\nSpecifically,
  SpatialOmicsOverlay was developed to visualize and analyze the\nfree-handed nature
  of Region of Interest (ROI) selection in a GeoMx\nexperiment, as well as the immunofluorescence-guided
  segmentation process.\nThe overlay from the instrument is recreated in the R environment,
  which\nallows for plotting overlays with data like ROI type or gene expression.
  The\npackage provides a convenient workflow for users to generate customized,\nsharable
  visualizations.\n\nThe Introduction to SpatialOmicsOverlay vignette demonstrates
  how to use\nOME-TIFF files, which are exported from the GeoMx platform. Participants\nwill
  learn how to interact with this file type and generate informative\nplots over images.
  This vignette utilizes data from our Spatial Organ Atlas.\nThe Spatial Organ Atlas
  is a freely-accesible resource of whole\ntranscriptome spatial profiles of functional
  components of tissues from\nhuman and mouse generated using our Whole Transcriptome
  Atlas RNA assay. In\nparticular, vignette users will be analyzing data from the
  mouse brain. This\ncontent is similar to the vignette available with the package
  upon\ninstallation.\n"

  they are VCF format, and can be fully standardised with MungeSumstats.


  MungeSumstats provides a framework to standardise the format for any GWAS

  summary statistics, including those in VCF format, enabling downstream

  integration and analysis. It addresses the most common discrepancies across

  summary statistic files, and offers a range of adjustable Quality Control

  (QC) steps.

description: 'The ability to easily and efficiently analyse RNA-sequencing data is
  a key

  strength of the Bioconductor project. Starting with counts summarised at the

  gene-level, a typical analysis involves pre-processing, exploratory data

  analysis, differential expression testing and pathway analysis with the

  results obtained informing future experiments and validation studies. In this

  workflow article, we analyse RNA-sequencing data from the mouse mammary gland,

  demonstrating use of the popular edgeR package to import, organise, filter

  and normalise the data, followed by the limma package with its voom method,

  linear modelling and empirical Bayes moderation to assess differential

  expression and perform gene set testing. This pipeline is further enhanced

  by the Glimma package which enables interactive exploration of the results

  so that individual samples and genes can be examined by the user. The complete

  analysis offered by these three packages highlights the ease with which

  researchers can turn the raw counts from an RNA-sequencing experiment into

  biological insights using Bioconductor.

  data by providing a complete analysis of an RNA-seq experiment profiling

  epithelial cell subsets in the mouse mammary gland. The workflow uses R

  software packages from the open-source Bioconductor project and covers all

  steps of the analysis pipeline, including alignment of read sequences, data

  exploration, differential expression analysis, visualization and pathway

  analysis. Read alignment and count quantification is conducted using the

  Rsubread package and the statistical analyses are performed using the edgeR

  package. The differential expression analysis uses the quasi-likelihood

description: 'Advances in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies that measure the

  transcriptome of biological samples have revolutionised our ability to

  understand transcriptional regulatory programs that underpin diseases

  such as cancer. We recently published singscore - a single-sample, rank-based

  gene set scoring method which quantifies how concordant the transcriptional

  profile of individual samples are relative to specific gene sets of interest.

  Here we demonstrate the application of singscore to investigate

  transcriptional profiles associated with specific mutations or genetic lesions

  in acute myeloid leukemia. Using matched genomic and transcriptomic data

  available through The Cancer Genome Atlas we show that scoring of appropriate

  signatures can distinguish samples with corresponding mutations, reflecting

  the ability of these mutations to drive aberrant transcriptional programs

  involved in leukemogenesis. We believe the singscore method is particularly

  useful for studying heterogeneity within specific subsets of cancers, and as

  demonstrated, singscore has the ability to identify samples where alternative

  mutations/genetic lesions appear to drive transcriptional programs.
