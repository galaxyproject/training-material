        In this tutorial, we will provide a walkthrough on how to generate a customized protein
        sequence database using RNA-Seq data.  The resultant FASTA database contains sequences
        with single amino acid variants (SAVs), insertions and deletions (indels)and transcript
        assemblies (splicing variants). This database can then be used to identify protein sequence
        variants from the mass spectrometry data.

        mass spectrometry data against a custom proteogenomics FASTA database to create peptide
        spectral matches (PSMs) for each dataset; we also isolate non-canonical peptides from the
        resulting data for further analysis.

According to the WHO, in 2018 there were 10.0 million new cases of TB worldwide and 1.4 million deaths due to the disease, making TB the world’s most deadly infectious disease. Variation in the genome of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) is associated with changes in phenotype, for example drug resistance and virulence. It is also useful for outbreak investigation as the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a sample can be used to build a phylogeny."

Prokka finds and annotates features (both protein coding regions and RNA genes, i.e. tRNA, rRNA) present on on a sequence. Prokka can be used to annotate bacterial, archaeal and viral genomes quickly, generating standard output files in GenBank, EMBL and gff formats."

      type: Tutorial
      speaker: [hrhotz, lldelisle]
      description: "In many eukaryotic organisms, such as humans, the genome is tightly packed and organized with the help of nucleosomes (chromatin). A nucleosome is a complex formed by eight histone proteins that is wrapped with ~147bp of DNA. When the DNA is being actively transcribed into RNA, the DNA will be opened and loosened from the nucleosome complex. Many factors, such as the chromatin structure, the position of the nucleosomes, and histone modifications, play an important role in the organization and accessibility of the DNA. Consequently, these factors are also important for the activation and inactivation of genes. Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-Seq) is a method to investigate the accessibility of chromatin and thus a method to determine regulatory mechanisms of gene expression. The method can help identify promoter regions and potential enhancers and silencers. "

    long as you want. The only difference will be that you should ask your questions
    on the <a href="(https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby)">GTN Gitter channel</a>, instead of Slack.
