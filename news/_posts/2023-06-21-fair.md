Katarzyna Kamieniecka (University of Bradford), a member of the ELIXIR-UK Fellowship Programme, has just launched a new series of lessons to improve {FAIR} data management in the life sciences. The lessons are designed to help researchers and research support staff understand the principles of FAIR data management and apply them to their own work.

The lessons cover three key topics:

- [FAIR in a nutshell]({% link topics/fair/tutorials/fair-intro/tutorial.md %}): provides a short introduction to the FAIR principles and their origin.
- [FAIR data management solutions]({% link topics/fair/tutorials/data-management/tutorial.md %}): discusses a FAIR data management framework that can be used to improve the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of research data.
- [FAIR Galaxy Training Material]({% link topics/fair/tutorials/fair-gtn/tutorial.md %}): shows how to set and use existing resources to make Galaxy training development and content creation FAIR.

The lessons are available online and can be accessed by anyone. They are a valuable resource for anyone who wants to improve their data management practices.

## Where can I learn more?

You can find out more about the new lessons on the [ELIXIR-UK Fellowship site](http://fellowship.elixiruknode.org/) and its [recommended resources page](http://fellowship.elixiruknode.org/recommended_resources).
