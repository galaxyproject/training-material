ELIXIR-UK's Data Stewardship Fellowship is excited to announce a new learning pathway focused on FAIR Data Management! This program equips researchers and research support staff with the skills to effectively manage their research data.

By following FAIR principles, you ensure your data is discoverable by others, can be easily integrated with other datasets, and is readily available for future research. **Together, let's make FAIR data management a standard practice in research!**

You can find out more about the new lessons on the [ELIXIR-UK Fellowship site](http://fellowship.elixiruknode.org/) and its [recommended resources page](https://fellowship.elixiruknode.org/training_materials/).
