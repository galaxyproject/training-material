The GTN has added persistent URL identifiers for our tutorials, slides, and FAQs. Using the `gxy.io` service, we have reserved `GTN` namespace for our persistent URLs. These work similarly to DOIs in that they will always point to a specific training material.

## What are PURLs?

PURLs are persistent URLs, and can be used to link to a specific version of a tutorial.

## How do I use them?

The PURLs are in the form `gxy.io/GTN:[id]`, where `[id]` is the identifier of the tutorial, slide, or FAQ. For example, the identifier for the [Galaxy Installation with Ansible](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/ansible-galaxy/tutorial.html) tutorial is `GTN:T00001`. The PURL for this tutorial is thus [gxy.io/GTN:T00001](https://gxy.io/GTN:T00001). This will always point to the Ansible Galaxy tutorial, no matter what changes are made to the tutorial in the future.

## How do I find the PURL for a tutorial?

You'll find these in the bottom of the "Overview" box of tutorials.
