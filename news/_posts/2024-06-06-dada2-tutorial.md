The GTN hosts its [400th tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/news/2024/06/06/400-tutorials-milestone.html): **Building an amplicon sequence variant (ASV) table from 16S data using DADA2**

The investigation of environmental microbial communities and microbiomes has been revolutionized by the development of high-throughput amplicon sequencing. In amplicon sequencing a particular genetic locus, for example the 16S rRNA gene (or a part of it) in bacteria, is amplified from DNA extracted from the community of interest, and then sequenced on a next-generation sequencing platform. This technique removes the need to culture microbes in order to detect their presence, and cost-effectively provides a deep census of a microbial community.

This new Galaxy training explores 16S amplicon data processing using **DADA2** and exploration using **Phyloseq**.
