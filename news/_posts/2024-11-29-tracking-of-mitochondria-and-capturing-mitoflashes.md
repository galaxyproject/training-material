We are happy to share that a new imaging tutorial for **Tracking Mitochondria and Capturing Mitoflashes** is now available in the Galaxy Training Network!

![Mitoflash Analysis Pipeline]({% link topics/imaging/images/detection-of-mitoflashes/Workflow_mitoflash.png %} "Analysis Pipeline for Tracking Mitochonria and Capturing Mitoflashes. Overview of the workflow for detecting mitoflash using Mitochondrion detection (Step 1), Mitochondrion tracking (Step 2), and Curve fitting to measured intensities (Step 3).")

This tutorial, Tracking of mitochondria and capturing mitoflashes, provides a step-by-step guide on analyzing mitoflash events in mitochondria using Galaxy. Mitoflashes are transient mitochondrial events characterized by bursts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), membrane potential depolarization, and matrix alkalinization. They are linked to bioenergetic states, physiological processes (like muscle contraction and neuronal development), and may serve as markers of mitochondrial health and longevity. Our tutorial explains how to preprocess imaging data, identify mitoflash events, and quantify key parameters (amplitude, duration, and frequency) using informatics tools in Galaxy. It is designed for researchers studying mitochondrial behavior in health and disease.
