Based on user feedback of the difficulties of the GTN news submission process we have significantly simplified and removed the need for manually editing a YAML file by providing a quick and easy [Google Form](https://forms.gle/TqGTr6y46wrJDri7A)

Any news submitted via this form will be reviewed by the GTN maintainers, and, when linting is passing, merged.

So if you have some cool training news you want to share, then please let us know!

*Fun Fact*: This news post was prepared in the new Google Form.
