As part of the [EuroScienceGateway](https://eurosciencegateway.eu/) and in cooperation with [Onedata](https://onedata.org) and [EGI](https://www.egi.eu/) we are providing all [GTN](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) training data on a publicly accessible [cloud storage](https://datahub.egi.eu/share/2697e33bd34f1870b0961414b8c77753chf583).
Those training datasets are curated, small but meaningful for educational purposes and contain 1530 files with a total size of 170Gb.
An invaluable set of resources for everyone dealing with data science and training.
Please thank the more than [350 contributors to GTN]({% link hall-of-fame.md %}).

## Accessing GTN Data in the Cloud

GTN training data is always accessible, annotated and linked for every tutorial. Usually, it's stored in Zenodo, referenced via a DOI.
You can access all GTN training data using several methods:

1. **Onedata Share** — access without authentication:

    a. Visit the [public share link](https://datahub.egi.eu/share/2697e33bd34f1870b0961414b8c77753chf583)
       to browse and download the data via the Onedata Web UI.

    b. Use the public [REST API](https://onedata.org/#/home/api/stable/onezone?anchor=operation/get_shared_data)
       to access the data; on the share page (see above) you will find ready-to-use `curl` examples by right-clicking on a file/directory and choosing the **Information** context menu.

2. **Galaxy Server integration**: access the data on the [European Galaxy server](https://usegalaxy.eu/). Go to the "Upload data" button, select "Choose remote files," and navigate to the GTN repository.

3. **Configure your own Galaxy server**: to include the GTN data in your Galaxy server, use the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    - type: onedata
      id: gtn_public_onedata
      label: GTN training data
      doc: Training data from the Galaxy Training Network (powered by Onedata)
      # The following token is a public, read-only token that can be shared.
      accessToken: "MDAxY2xvY2F00aW9uIGRhdGFodWIuZWdpLmV1CjAwNmJpZGVudGlmaWVyIDIvbm1kL3Vzci00yNmI4ZTZiMDlkNDdjNGFkN2E3NTU00YzgzOGE3MjgyY2NoNTNhNS9hY3QvMGJiZmY1NWU4NDRiMWJjZGEwNmFlODViM2JmYmRhNjRjaDU00YjYKMDAxNmNpZCBkYXRhLnJlYWRvbmx5CjAwNDljaWQgZGF00YS5wYXRoID00gTHpaa1pUTTROMkl4WmpjMllXVmpOMlU00WWpreU5XWmtNV00ZpT1RKbU1ETXlZMmhoWTJReAowMDJmc2lnbmF00dXJlIIQvnXp01Oey02LnaNwEkFJAyArzhHN8SlXSYFsBbSkqdqCg"
      onezoneDomain: "datahub.egi.eu"
    ```

4. **Onedata clients** — access the data using the public read-only access token and
   [Oneclient](https://www.onedata.org/#/home/documentation/21.02/user-guide/oneclient.html) (local POSIX mount)
   or [OnedataFS](https://onedata.org/#/home/documentation/21.02/user-guide/onedatafs.html) 
   ([PyFilesystem](https://www.pyfilesystem.org/) interface), e.g.:

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/oneclient
    oneclient \
        -H plg-cyfronet-01.datahub.egi.eu \
        -t MDAxY2xvY2F00aW9uIGRhdGFodWIuZWdpLmV1CjAwNmJpZGVudGlmaWVyIDIvbm1kL3Vzci00yNmI4ZTZiMDlkNDdjNGFkN2E3NTU00YzgzOGE3MjgyY2NoNTNhNS9hY3QvMGJiZmY1NWU4NDRiMWJjZGEwNmFlODViM2JmYmRhNjRjaDU00YjYKMDAxNmNpZCBkYXRhLnJlYWRvbmx5CjAwNDljaWQgZGF00YS5wYXRoID00gTHpaa1pUTTROMkl4WmpjMllXVmpOMlU00WWpreU5XWmtNV00ZpT1RKbU1ETXlZMmhoWTJReAowMDJmc2lnbmF00dXJlIIQvnXp01Oey02LnaNwEkFJAyArzhHN8SlXSYFsBbSkqdqCg \
        ~/oneclient
    ls ~/oneclient/GTN\ data
    ```

## What is the GTN Downloader?

[GTN-Downloader](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/gtn-downloader) makes it easier for users to access and organize data from the [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/).
The GTN Downloader is a Python script that automates the download of data from GTN tutorials. It goes through the tutorials in the GTN repository, finds `data-library.yaml` files,
and creates a structured directory based on the tutorial names and file contents.

### Key Features:
- **Automated Data Download**: The script finds `data-library.yaml` files in the GTN repository and downloads the associated data files.
- **Structured Organization**: It creates directories based on the tutorial names and the information in the `data-library.yaml` files, so the files are organized.
- **Download Summary**: It generates a `download-summary.tsv` file, which includes metadata about the downloaded files, a download report (error, success, already downloaded), and the overall size of the files.

## Seamless Integration with Onedata

In addition to local downloads, the GTN Downloader can upload data to [Onedata](https://onedata.org), a distributed data management platform. This integration ensures that the latest GTN data is always available to users.

### Automated Workflow with GitHub CI/CD:
- **Automated Workflow**: A GitHub Actions workflow runs once a week on weekends to download the latest data from the GTN tutorials and upload it to Onedata.
- **Environment Setup**: The workflow sets up necessary environment variables and installs dependencies, including Oneclient, the Onedata POSIX client.
- **Data Upload**: After downloading the data, the workflow uploads it to Onedata, making it publicly accessible.
