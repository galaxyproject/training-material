Hey Galaxy admins! Have you ever wanted to administer your own instance from
the luxury of your pocket?

Now you can, with **Galaxy In Your Pocket™!**

## Why?

Run your instance without having to worry about the usual concerns: a
noisy server, too many cables, bad internet, or just a plain
unwillingness to spend time away from a screen.

Having *Galaxy In Your Pocket™*, you can run and administer your own
instance all from the same portable device that you use to ignore your
loved ones with!

## How?

With [just a few steps](https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/3644481), you
can have Galaxy running on a mobile ARM device of your own.

Above is an image of a Galaxy server running within
[Phosh UI](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Phosh) in *PostmarketOS* on an
[Alcatel Idol 347](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Alcatel_Idol_3_4.7%22_(alcatel-idol347)),
using a Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A53 CPU and 1.3GB of RAM, with a 5GB swap mounted.

As you can see from the `htop` output in the lower half of the image
on the right, Galaxy server can easily run on 1GB RAM.

### What's working?

On this phone, just the Galaxy server at the moment, and even then
only with some developer dependencies disabled. The Galaxy client (UI + webpage)
also has some issues, but *could probably* also be built,
albeit on a device with a bit more RAM.

## Really, why?

Just imagine: *Galaxy In Your Pocket™*! A united Galaxy Client and
Galaxy Server running on your phone 📲, which you can then access using
that same phone's web browser.

It's the perfect setup that only a *true and dedicated* Galaxy Admin
such as yourself can dream about.

Or if you're not buying any of this, then it's for those emergency
situations where you forgot your laptop and need to solve a bioinformatics crisis on the go.
