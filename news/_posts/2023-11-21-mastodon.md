We did not formally announce it at the time, but the Galaxy Training Network
has migrated from Twitter/X to Mastodon, as that platform no longer aligns with
the Galaxy Project Code of Conduct [nor our community values.](https://www.mediamatters.org/twitter/musk-endorses-antisemitic-conspiracy-theory-x-has-been-placing-ads-apple-bravo-ibm-oracle)

If you'd like to keep up to date with the GTN, we encourage you to [follow us on mastodon](https://mstdn.science/@gtn). The [fediverse and mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) are an open, standards compliant social network that is significantly more aligned with our community values and priorities of keeping community safe.

Are you not a fediverse user? Do you not have a mastodon account? That's ok!
Every mastodon account has a built in [RSS feed which you can use to stay updated](https://mstdn.science/@gtn.rss),
and the GTN has an [RSS feed as well for our news](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/feed.xml).
