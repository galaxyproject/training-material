Many GTN tutorials already have recordings. These recordings were made by members of the community for a variety of (online) training events.
Up until now, this video library were part of the [Gallantries Project](https://gallantries.github.io/).
We have now integrated this video library directly into the GTN, and made it even **easier to add video recordings** to GTN tutorials or slide decks! Just use a Google Form to submit your video recordings!

Want to record one of our tutorials? **We welcome video recordings from everybody!**[^1]

Please checkout out our FAQs with instructions for adding your own recordings:

Instructors                  | Just fill out an updated Google Form and we'll take care of the rest. The google form is now more easily discoverable, as are the recording instructions which provide a best practice guide for doing screen recordings of tutorials. We have updated documentation on recording best practices that are easy to follow.
Event Organisers & Teachers  | Easily discover our large library of both human and automated video recordings to use in your training materials. All videos are licensed CC-BY so you can use them in your own training materials or even embed them in your course websites (Moodle, Blackboard, etc).
GTN Editors & Maintainers    | When a recording is submitted, a pull request will be opened with the appropriate metadata in the correct location and an easy checklist to follow to make sure everyone's video is processed efficiently with every step taken care of.

## Video Library 1.0

This work is based on the work done during the @gtn:gallantries project and the [Video Library 1.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/news/2021/11/23/video-library.html). As that project ended, the features developed during that time have now been rolled into the GTN to ensure their long term sustainability

The number of videos and hours is slightly lower in the GTN version as we have not yet imported every recording, currently we are missing some recordings which are not directly associated with a GTN material (e.g. webinars).


[^1]: They must be a recording of a GTN tutorial being taught. We are not accepting recordings of other training events at this time.
