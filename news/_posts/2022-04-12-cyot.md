It has been a long discussed feature within the GTN Tutorial Author Community: how can we provide trainees with choice in their tutorials, and how can we as trainers not duplicate large tutorials just to show a slightly different path at one point?

We are happy to announce that we now support "Choose Your Own Tutorial" blocks wherein a student following the training materials can make a choice: do they want to follow this path with STAR? Or featureCounts? It's up to you!
