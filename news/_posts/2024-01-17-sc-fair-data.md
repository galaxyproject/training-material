# New single cell section: Changing data formats & preparing objects

Now a nightmare of switching between single cell datatypes or importing the data is gone! With the new section on Changing data formats & preparing objects, the users can now confidently jump into the analysis. Some of those tutorials were created in the framework of ELIXIR-UK: FAIR Data Stewardship training, which aims to improve Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable (FAIR) data management in the life sciences. 

We have developed the following tutorials:
-	[Converting between common single cell data formats]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-data-ingest/tutorial.md %})
-	[Importing files for single cell analysis from public atlases]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/EBI-retrieval/tutorial.md %})
-	[Converting NCBI Data to the AnnData Format]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-ncbi-anndata/tutorial.md %})
-	[Creating a single-cell RNA-seq reference dataset for deconvolution]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/bulk-music-2-preparescref/tutorial.md %})
-	[Creating the bulk RNA-seq dataset for deconvolution]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/bulk-music-3-preparebulk/tutorial.md %})


# Where can I learn more?

You can find out more about the FAIR Data Stewardship training on the [ELIXIR-UK Fellowship site](http://fellowship.elixiruknode.org/). Also, keep an eye on the upcoming live trainings!
