In the middle, a split violin plot showing the expression of unknown genes in blue on one side and the expression of the genes in an opposing sample in orange alongside. Snuck in between these three important plots is a PhD comic of data showing no trend, with the chat box “Hmm… I think there’s a clear trend happening here.”"

Single-cell analysis now has [it's own topic]({% link topics/single-cell/index.md %})! These tutorials were previously part of the [transcriptomics topic]({% link topics/transcriptomics/index.md %}), but due to the amazing efforts by  {%- include _includes/contributor-badge.html id="nomadscientist" -%},  {%- include _includes/contributor-badge.html id="mtekman" -%}  and others, we now have so many single-cell analysis tutorials that they deserve their own dedicated topic! From introductory slides and practicals, to case study tutorials generating cell clusters and trajectories from raw sequencing files, and even a growing subtopic of smaller tips and tricks for adapting analysis to user needs, the single cell topic either has what you need or is working on it. Come learn or get involved!

Exciting new single-cell tutorials are also planned to be added in the near future, so keep your eyes on this hot topic!
