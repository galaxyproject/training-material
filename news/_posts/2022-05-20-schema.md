Within the GTN we have had schemas for the various metadata we keep for a long time. It helps us automatically check community contributions to ensure they conform to all of the GTN standards, and will work correctly in our environment.

Until now the available metadata was not described in a single location, but potentially spread across multiple tutorials or undocumented. We have updated our documentation to include descriptions and examples of each field, and [they are now available to browse]({% link topics/contributing/tutorials/schemas/tutorial.md %}). You do not need to know anything about schemas or their implementation to use our user friendly and well documented examples.
