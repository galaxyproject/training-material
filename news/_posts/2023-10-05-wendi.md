We at the GTN strive to bring you the most fun and fancy features we can in a completely static site! Today we're addressing the question of Wendi Bacon who needed a solution for keeping her [single cell](https://singlecell.usegalaxy.eu) subdomain up-to-date with all the latest happenings in the Single Cell world.


## Tutorial List

In order to help her keep her tutorial list updated, we turned every tag on the GTN into an embeddable widget

<iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/tags/10x/embed.html" height="300px" width="100%" class="gtn-embed"></iframe>

You can embed a tag by using the url format

```html
<iframe src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/tags/TAG/embed.html"
  height="300px" width="100%" class="gtn-embed" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```

## UseGalaxy.\* Workflow List

We also made a widget for the UseGalaxy.\* Workflow List so you can embed the latest and greatest workflows with any given tag/name from any of the UseGalaxy.\* servers!

<iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/workflows/embed.html?query=circos" height="300px" width="100%" class="gtn-embed"></iframe>

You can embed this workflow listing by using the following code, just swap out your search term!

```html
<iframe src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/workflows/embed.html?query=circos"
  height="300px" width="100%" class="gtn-embed" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```
