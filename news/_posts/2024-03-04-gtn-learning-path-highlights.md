We know the GTN has a *lot* of learning materials ([400 and counting!]({% link stats/index.md %})) which can make it quite difficult to figure out where to start in some topics.

In order to make it easier for you to find your way, we have started highlighting a number of our **Learning Paths** which are like guided tours through the GTN's content. They are designed to help you learn a topic from start to finish, and are a great way to get a comprehensive understanding of a topic.

Check them out now!

- [Single Cell]({% link topics/single-cell/index.md %})
- [Microbiome]({% link topics/microbiome/index.md %})
- [Admin Training]({% link topics/admin/index.md %})

👩‍🏫 for GTN topic maintainers, if you'd like to either create a learning path for your topic, or have an existing one highlighted, please get in touch with us in Matrix!
