Introducing Learning Pathways in the GTN! Learning pathways are sets of tutorials curated for you by community experts to form a coherent set of lessons around a topic, building up knowledge step by step.

Learning paths can be accessed from the top menu bar in the GTN (or jump directly to the [learning pathways page]({% link learning-pathways/ %}) now). Check back here often as we add more learning pathways over time!

Teaching with Galaxy? Learning pathways are an ideal starting point to build the program for your training event!

Want to add your own learning pathway? Check out this [FAQ]({% link topics/contributing/faqs/learning-pathways.md %}) for instructions. We very much welcome and encourage contributions of learning pathways!
