Are you one of our amazing GTN Contributors? Were you ever bothered by how slow it was to build the site locally? This is now fixed completely! We have replaced one of the slowest steps of the GTN's build process and rewritten it ourselves to be more performant.

Additionally this means when you make contributions to the GTN you no longer need to wait 20 minutes to have all of the links checked in your contribution before it can be merged, as that step now completes in under 1 minute!

Happy contributing!
