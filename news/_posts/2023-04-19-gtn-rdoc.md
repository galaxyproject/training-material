The internal functions of the GTN have, in the past, not been very well documented. Now we have started the process of fully documenting the functions and modules available to GTN developers.

Our library of liquid filters, and functions that we use throughout the GTN, can be found at [the GTN Rdoc page](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/gtn_rdoc/). For example many of our filters are available in [Jekyll::GtnFunctions](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/gtn_rdoc/Jekyll/GtnFunctions.html)

This documentation is a work in progress but will improve over time, as we hopefully consolidate and clean up our function library into a more useful "GTN" module.
