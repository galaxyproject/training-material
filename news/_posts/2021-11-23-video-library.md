After runnning a number of virtual training events this year (e.g. [Smörgåsbord](https://shiltemann.github.io/global-galaxy-course/), [GCC2021](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2021/training/)), we now have a large collection of training videos around the GTN materials, created by this community.

To make these videos easier to find, we now list the available videos in the overview box at the top of each tutorial.

This will take you to the video page on the new [GTN Video Library](https://gallantries.github.io/video-library) website:

Below these videos in the video library you will find a link to the GTN archive showing the tutorial **as it appeared at the time of recording**, and also support **multiple versions** of the videos of this tutorial at different points in time.

We will also use this video library as a basis for a **course builder** to help instructors and event organisers re-use these videos in their own workshops with minimal effort, stay tuned!
