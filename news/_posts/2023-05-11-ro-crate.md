As part of the BY-COVID project, the RO-Crate team and BY-COVID members have
brought several RO-Crate related tutorials into the Galaxy Training Network, under a brand new {FAIR} topic!

## What are RO-Crates?

> RO-Crate is a community effort to establish a lightweight approach to packaging research data with their metadata. It is based on schema.org annotations in JSON-LD, and aims to make best-practice in formal metadata description accessible and practical for use in a wider variety of situations, from an individual researcher working with a folder of data, to large data-intensive computational research environments.

These are *the* way to package up your research in a well annotated and {FAIR} manner.

There are a number of ["profiles" within RO-Crates](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/profiles.html), we are currently focused on the "Workflow Run" profile but we encourage you to look into the [other profiles](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/profiles.html)

## What's new for you?

As part of this collaboration we bring you several new tutorials:

- ["Workflow Run RO-Crate Introduction"]({% link topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-workflow-run-ro-crate/tutorial.md %}), an introduction to RO-Crate profiles to represent workflow executions.
- ["RO-Crate in Python"]({% link topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-in-python/tutorial.md %}), create your own RO-Crate from scratch! Find out what data is involved and what is possible with the format.
- ["Exporting Workflow Run RO-Crates from Galaxy"]({% link topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-in-galaxy/tutorial.md %}), how do to export crates from Galaxy easily?
- ["Best practices for workflows in GitHub repositories"]({% link topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-galaxy-best-practices/tutorial.md %}), and what to do with them after.
- ["Submitting workflows to LifeMonitor"]({% link topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-submitting-life-monitor/tutorial.md %}), automation makes life easier!

These tutorials are meant to help you learn how to use and create RO-Crates in your own work.

## Where can I learn more?

These tutorials will be taught at [Smörgåsbord 3](https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/events/smorgasbord3/) so 
if you want to learn more, [go sign up now!](https://gxy.io/smorgasbord3-register)

## I want more FAIR Training!

While the addition of the RO-Crates tutorials marks the creation of a new Galaxy Training Network topic, {FAIR} training, it currently only has tutorials focused on Research Objects and specifically the workflow profile. But watch this space! More tutorials are coming soon.
