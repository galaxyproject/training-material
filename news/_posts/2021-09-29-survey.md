**Do you use Galaxy for Training? Have your say! Please take a few minutes to let us know about your training experiences.**

We, the Galaxy Training Network, would like to get feedback from instructors on the use of Galaxy for training, the preparation needed but also on the [Galaxy Training Material](https://training.galaxyproject.org/).

This survey should take less than 10 minutes and every questions are optional and can be skipped. It will help us prioritise improvements to the training materials. We're currently focused on making it easier to prepare and give trainings.
