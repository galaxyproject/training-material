Two new assembly tutorials have been added to the GTN! These tutorials walk you through the
process of assembling MRSA strains from real-world datasets. MRSA stands for "Methicillin-
resistant *Staphylococcus aureus*, it is resistance to several antibiotics and is a common
source of hospital-acquired infections and outbreaks. In this tutorial you will assess the
quality of your data, perform an assembly and assess its quality, analyze your data for the
presence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, and annotate the genome using Prokka and
JBrowse.

The two tutorials are related; in one you perform this analysis on Nanopore MinION data, and
in the other you perform a similar analysis on Illlumina-sequenced datasets.
