We recently [presented the GTN](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xXzd7io07KdBk-vVSh_27wlS5bzlDmGuxxpjWL2vB2w/edit?usp=sharing) at the [2024 Galaxy Community Conference](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2024/). This [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xXzd7io07KdBk-vVSh_27wlS5bzlDmGuxxpjWL2vB2w/edit?usp=sharing) was a summary of the updates and new features that were added to the GTN in the past year.

Many of these updates have been covered in previous blog posts on the GTN, but when you put it all in a single presentation it really becomes clear how much the community has done over the last year!
