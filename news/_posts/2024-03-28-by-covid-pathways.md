As part of the work of [BeYond COVID](https://by-covid.org/), we have developed a new integration between the [MINERVA Platform](https://covid19map.elixir-luxembourg.org/minerva/)'s COVID-19 Disease Map and Galaxy! Datasets created within Galaxy can now be seamlessly visualized in the MINERVA Platform, allowing you to explore your data in the context of the COVID-19 Disease Map.

This work generated a number of brand new WorkflowHub Workflows, which can now be launched more easily than ever in the GTN:

{% snippet faqs/galaxy/workflows_run_wfh.md title="mRNA-Seq BY-COVID Pipeline: Counts" wfhub_id="688" version="1" %}

{% snippet faqs/galaxy/workflows_run_wfh.md title="mRNA-Seq BY-COVID Pipeline: Analysis" wfhub_id="689" version="1" %}

And a few new GTN features like the ability to embed a workflow visualisation directly into a tutorial.
Go check it out!
