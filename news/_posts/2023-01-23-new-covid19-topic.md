The GTN has long struggled with the rigid hierarchy of a single level of classification: topics. All materials had to be organised into a single topic, even when their contents sometimes spanned multiple topics! We added subtopics a while back to help further organise these tutorials, but that still did not solve the issue of needing to collect multiple learn materials in a single location for people to access.

Thus we have finally built tag based topics; these are not topic folders inside the GTN repository, but instead a collection of every tutorial tagged with some specific tag, organised into a new topic. As a demonstration of this, [we have setup a Covid-19 topic.]({{ site.baseurl }}/topics/covid19/)

We apologise for the long delay getting here, development time was quite limited for a long period during the pandemic, and we needed to re-organise some internal structures to better enable these new "views" into the GTN Materials.
