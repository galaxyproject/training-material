One of our contributors ({% include _includes/contributor-badge.html id="mtekman" %}) found himself wanting to link to a specific time point in a video. We said "Wow, what a fantastic idea!" and then we implemented it. To support that we developed a very simple standalone video player page where you can view the GTN videos and browse through our catalog. It features the full transcript on the left, some suggested videos on the right, and a very standard `<video>` player.

Check out the [new GTN Video home now]({{site.baseurl}}/videos/) now.
