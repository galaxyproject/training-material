We have just finished a new collection of training material for genome assembly and annotation! You now have access to slides and tutorials, focused on the complete analysis of the genome of a fungus species ([*Mucor mucedo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucor_mucedo)).

Have a look at the following updated/new slides:

- [Quality control of long reads sequencing data]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/slides.html %})
- [Getting started in a new genome assembly and annotation project]({% link topics/assembly/tutorials/get-started-genome-assembly/slides.html %})
- [Introduction to genome annotation]({% link topics/genome-annotation/slides/introduction.html %})

And check out these new tutorials:

- [Quality control of long reads sequencing data]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.md %}#assess-quality-with-nanoplot---long-reads-only)
- [Genome assembly of PacBio data using Flye]({% link topics/assembly/tutorials/flye-assembly/tutorial.md %})
- [Repeat masking of a genome sequence using RepeatMasker]({% link topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/repeatmasker/tutorial.md %})
- [Genome annotation using Funannotate]({% link topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/funannotate/tutorial.md %})
- [Functional annotation using EggNOG-Mapper and InterProScan]({% link topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/funannotate/tutorial.md %}#functional-annotation)
- [Annotation visualisation with JBrowse]({% link topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/funannotate/tutorial.md %}#visualisation-with-a-genome-browser)

All this material has been developed for a [workshop on genome assembly and annotation](https://wwz.ifremer.fr/Recherche/Departements-scientifiques/Departement-Infrastructures-de-Recherche-et-Systemes-d-Information/Bioinformatique/Animations-scientifiques/Formation-Assemblage-et-Annotation-de-genome-2021), occurring this week in Roscoff, France. The genome annotation material is also a contribution to the [Galaxy Genome Annotation](https://galaxy-genome-annotation.github.io/) initiative and to the [Gallantries Grant](https://gallantries.github.io/). We are looking forward for the community to test these new modules, and we will probably present them during the next GTN online events!
