Single cell RNA-seq analysis is a cornerstone of developmental research and provides a great level of detail in understanding the underlying dynamic processes within tissues. In the context of plants, this highlights some of the key differentiation pathways that root cells undergo.

This tutorial replicates the paper {% cite Denyer_2019 %}, where the major plant cell types are recovered in the data as well as distinguishing between QC and meristematic cells.
