Our event pages are based on what we have learned from years of organizing and running training events. Additionally our experiences across the last three GTN Smörgåsbords significantly informed the event pages we present today, so we know they're capable of everything you'll want to do!

**Already have a course webpage?** No problem! you can still add your event to the GTN and we will simply to your event webpage.
