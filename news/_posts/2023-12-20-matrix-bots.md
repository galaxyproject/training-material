ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬ Bleep bloop! Good news everyone! We have deployed some bots to enable our Matrix regulars
to better engage with the contributions and questions of our users on
the non-Matrix side of the Galaxy-verse.

## Galaxy Help Posts

The newest bot we've added looks through the [Galaxy Help](https://help.galaxyproject.org/) forum for topics in need of
answering, and forwards those to the humans in Matrix channels related to those topics! 

We are currently trialing this new integration to provide high quality human help with the Single Cell CoP. If it's successful, our first expansion will be to the admin channel.

## GTN Contributions

Our existing GTN bot summarizes the contributions to the GTN each day and delivers the great news to the
[GTN Matrix Lobby](https://app.element.io/#/room/#Galaxy-Training-Network_Lobby:gitter.im), as well as single-cell specific updates just to the [Single Cell User Community](https://app.element.io/#/room/#!yuLoaCWKpFHkWPmVEO:gitter.im). 

Would your community like to receive these daily GTN updates for your community? Reach out to us on [Matrix](https://app.element.io/#/room/#Galaxy-Training-Network_Lobby:gitter.im) or [GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/issues/). Currently this integration is only available for Matrix but if it would be useful as an RSS feed please let us know.

Thanks to these new 'intergalactic' communication methods, the world just got a little smaller!
