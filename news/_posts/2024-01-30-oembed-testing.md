Howdy teachers and support staff! We are exploring displaying GTN content directly in the Galaxy Help site, furthering the integration between the GTN and the Galaxy community infrastructure.
When you paste a GTN <abbr title="FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions</abbr> URL into the Galaxy Discourse, it will now be rendered directly in Discourse!

![screenshot of a discourse post, a black and white box shows "FAQ: Cr√©er un nouvel history" and the contents of the FAQ]({% link assets/images/oembed.png %} "Adding a GTN FAQ to your Galaxy Help answers can provide learners with a lot of context directly in the post, meaning they never have to leave the thread they're reading to understand what they need to do to resolve their issue.")

This integration is currently in beta, and other infrastructure may be affected. If you see GTN FAQ URLs rendering poorly anywhere else, please let us know in the [GTN Chat](https://matrix.to/#/!Galaxy-Training-Network_Lobby:gitter.im)
