The GTN does a lot of work to adhere to the best practices for FAIR training materials as set out in {% cite Garcia2020 %} and a lot of this work is behind-the-scenes or automatic from the infrastructure we provide, and we wanted to highlight that for educators and organisers who want to use GTN materials. This is one of the ways the GTN works to makes itself a fantastic platform training. Find out how contributing simple markdown tutorials [can result in fantastically FAIR training.]({% link faqs/gtn/fair_training.md %})

Collaborative lesson development is likewise very important to us and we follow all of the best practices set out in {% cite Devenyi_2018 %}. Find out how in [our FAQ]({% link faqs/gtn/collaborative_development.md %})
