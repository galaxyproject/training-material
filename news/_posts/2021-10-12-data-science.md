As part of our work under the [Gallantries Grant](https://gallantries.github.io/) we are establishing a new topic within the GTN specifically focused on Data Science skills. This topic will include tutorials covering things such as:

- Python
- R
- SQL
- the Command Line
- Git

as well as a number of supporting topics on data management and ensuring your data is FAIR. We currently have the R, SQL, and command line lessons so go [check those out now!]({{ site.baseurl }}/topics/data-science/)
