The Galaxy Training Network has finally added a dedicated #SARS-CoV-2 topic within our materials! Previously you could find all of the various Covid-19 tutorials spread out across the numerous topics but now they're all collected in one central location.

Thanks to @hexylena@tech.lgbt for implementing support for this, and @zerodivision@scholar.social for writing so many of the tutorials and volunteering to maintain this topic!

Additionally this is the first toot collaboratively authored on GitHub, following @zerodivision@scholar.social and @hexylena@tech.lgbt's discussion of how to toot from a GitHub Action! https://scholar.social/@zerodivision/109681590553105322
