  et al. 2010</a> until the population genomics statistics calculation step
  using STACKS pipeline. In a de novo RAD-seq data analysis, the reads are
  aligned one on each other to create stacks and then clustered to build loci.

      In the study of <a
      href="http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000862">Hohenlohe
      et al. 2010</a>, a genome scan of nucleotide diversity and differentiation
      in natural populations of threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus
      was conducted. Authors used Illumina-sequenced RAD tags to identify and
      type over 45,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each of 100
      individuals from two oceanic and three freshwater populations.

      We will re-analyze these data at least until the population genomics
      statistics calculation step using STACKS pipeline. Existing Gasterosteus
      aculeatus draft genome will not be used here so the analysis will be
      performed de novo. In a de novo RAD-seq data analysis, the reads are
      aligned one on each other to create stacks and then clustered to build
      loci. A reference approach can also be conducted (see <a
      href="http://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/ref-based-rad-seq/tutorial.html">ref_based
      tutorial</a>, allowing to work on existing assembled loci).

      The sequences are raw sequences from the sequencing machine, without any
      pretreatments. They need to be demultiplexed. To do so, we can use the
      Process Radtags tool from STACKS.

      For demultiplexing, we use the Process Radtags tool from <a

      Note that you can play also with the sliding window score threshold, by
