# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

In the study of [Hohenlohe *et al.* 2010](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000862), a genome scan of nucleotide diversity and differentiation in natural populations of threespine stickleback *Gasterosteus aculeatus* was conducted. Authors used Illumina-sequenced RAD tags to identify and type over 45,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each of 100 individuals from two oceanic and three freshwater populations.

![Abstract of the paper on Population Genomics](../../images/RAD4_Population_Genomics/Hohenlohe_et_al_2010.png)

We here proposed to re-analyze these data at least until the population genomics statistics calculation step using STACKS pipeline. Existing *Gasterosteus aculeatus* draft genome will not be used here so the analysis will be performed de novo. In a de novo RAD-seq data analysis, the reads are aligned one on each other to create stacks and then clustered to build loci. A reference approach can also be conducted (see [ref_based tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/ref-based-rad-seq/tutorial.html), allowing to work on existing assembled loci).

# Pretreatments

## Data upload

The original data is available at NCBI SRA ENA under accession number [SRR034310](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR034310) as part of the NCBI SRA ENA study accession number [SRP001747](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?study=SRP001747).

We will look at the first run SRR034310 out of seven which includes 16 samples from 2 populations, 8 from Bear Paw (freshwater) and 8 from Rabbit Slough (oceanic). We will download the reads directly from SRA and the remaining data (i.e reference genome, population map file, and barcodes file) from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1134547#.WkugUjfjJXI).

>    >    Changing the file type `fastq` to `fastqsanger` once the data file is in your history (warning! Be cautious because there is closed datatpes as `fastqcssanger`). As we know here that the datatype is `fastqsanger`, we can directly change it through the upcoming method. Normally, you need to execute `FastQGroomer` tool to be sure to have a correct `fastqsanger` file format. And if you don't know how your quality score is encoded on raw fastQ files, please, use the `FastQC` tool to determine it!

The sequences are raw sequences from the sequencing machine, without any pretreatments. They need to be demultiplexed. To do so, we can use the Process Radtags tool from STACKS.

## Demultiplexing reads

For demultiplexing, we use the Process Radtags tool from [STACKS](https://www.g3journal.org/content/1/3/171.full) .

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Demultiplexing reads
>
> 1. **Process Radtags** {% icon tool %}: Run `Stacks: process radtags` on FastQ file to demultiplex the reads
>  - Single-end or paired-end reads files: Single-end files
>  - singles-end reads infile(s): SRR034310.fastq(.gz)
>  - Barcode file: Barcode fileBarcodes_SRR034310.tabular
>  - Number of enzymes: One
>  - Enzyme: sbfI
>  - Capture discarded reads to a file: Yes
>  - Output format: fastq
>
> As we are exporting demultiplexed reads in data collections, you have hidden datasets on your history. These datasets are in fact symlinks on the data collections and are by default hidden on the history. If you want to see these datasets, you can click on the `hidden` statement just under the history name.

>    >    > 2. 8139531 retained reads
>    >    > 3. Exploring the `results.log` file allows you to see that there is no sequences filtered for low quality statement. As we don't specify the corresponding advanced option, Process radtags didn't apply quality related filtering. So here, all not retained sequences are not recorded because of an ambiguous barcode or an ambiguous RAD-Tag. This means that some barcodes are not exactly what was specified on the barcode file and that sometimes, no SbfI restriction enzyme site was found. This can be due to some sequencing problems but here, this is also due to the addition, in the original sequencing library, of RAD-seq samples from another study. This is something often used to avoid having too much sequences beginning with the exact same nucleotides sequences and thus Illumina related issues during sequencing and clusters analysis

> In `advanced options`, after activation of the `Discard reads with low quality scores` option, play with the score limit (default vs 20 for example) and examine the change in reads retained. Note that you can play also with the sliding window score threshold, by default 15% of the length of the read. This sliding window parameter allows notably the user to deal with the declining quality at the 3' end of reads.

>    >  3. There are no sequences filtered because of low quality. This is because radtags didn't apply quality related filtering since the corresponding advanced option (Discard reads with low quality scores) has not been enabled. So here, all not retained sequences are removed because of an ambiguous barcode (626265) or an ambiguous RAD-Tag (129493). This means that some barcodes are not exactly what was specified on the barcode file and that sometimes, no SbfI restriction enzyme site was found. This can be due to some sequencing problems but here, this is also due to the addition, in the original sequencing library, of RAD-seq samples from another study. This strategy is often used to avoid having too much sequences beginning with the exact same nucleotide sequence which may cause Illumina related issues during sequencing and cluster analysis

In order to obtain results of higher quality we will play with the advanced options:

> If like me you don't have payed attention to the organization of you file for the graphical representation you obtain a non optimal bars diagram with a not intelligent X-axis ordering. There is a lot of different manner to fix this. You can use the copy/paste "bidouille" like seen previously, or you can use Galaxy tools to manipulate the `radtags logs` (did you change the filename from `pasted entry` to another label ?) file to generate a better graph. For example, you can use `Select lines that match an expression` tool to select rows then use the `Concatenate datasets tail-to-head` tool to reorganize these lines in a new file... OR, as I made, you can just sort the file using the first column.

>   - Note that you can play also with the sliding window score threshold, by default 15% of the length of the read. This sliding window parameter allows notably the user to deal with the declining quality at the 3' end of reads.

Then we generate a graphical display of the changes:

> First we cut the interesting lines of each `result.log with Stacks: process radtags` 
>
> 3. **Select lines that match an expression** applying `^R1.fq.gz` on the log files and then
> 4. **Concatenate datasets tail-to-head** on the resulting data sets
> 
> Alternatively just copy/paste these lines on the Galaxy upload tool using Paste/fetch data section and modifying the File header by sample and filename by Score 10 / Score 20 and noscorelimit for example... Before Starting the upload, you can select the `Convert spaces to tabs` option through the `Upload configuration` wheel. If you did not pay attention to the order you can just sort the file using the first column.

```
quality	Retained Reads	Low Quality	Ambiguous Barcodes	Ambiguous RAD-Tag	Total
20	2980543		5158988		626265		129493		8895289
10	7373160		766371		626265		129493		8895289
nolimit	8139531		0		626265		129493		8895289
```

You can use the `Charts` functionality through the Visualize button to plot the data. 


![The bar diagram](../../images/RAD4_Population_Genomics/Process_radtags_charts_end.PNG)

Using a filter like `clean data, remove any read with an uncalled base` has only little impact:

The demultiplexed sequences are raw sequences from the sequencing machine, without any pretreatments. They need to be controlled for their quality.

## Quality control

For quality control, we use similar tools as described in [NGS-QC tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.html): [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

In this tutorial, we have analyzed real RAD sequencing data to extract useful information, such as which loci are candidate regarding the genetic differentiation between freshwater and oceanic Stickelback populations. To answer these questions, we analyzed RAD sequence datasets using a de novo RAD-seq data analysis approach. This approach can be sum up with the following scheme:
