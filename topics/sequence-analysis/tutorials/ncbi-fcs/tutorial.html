                <p>The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) performs contamination screening of genome assemblies submitted to the archival GenBank. Advances in genome sequencing have accelerated the production of genome assemblies and their submission to public databases, necessitating high-performance screening tools. Since contaminants can lead to misleading conclusions about the biology of the organism in question (e.g. gene content, gene evolution, etc.), ideally contamination screening should be performed after the initial contig assembly and prior to downstream genome analyses.</p>

<p>NCBI has released a publicly-available Foreign Contamination Screen (FCS) tool suite to detect contaminants from various sources and produce a cleaned sequence set. This tutorial provides a quick example of two current FCS tools: FCS-adaptor identifies synthetic sequences used in library preparation, and FCS-GX (<span class="citation"><a href="#Astashyn2024">Astashyn <i>et al.</i> 2024</a></span>) identifies sequences from foreign organisms assigned to discordant taxonomies compared to the user-declared source organism.</p>

<h1 id="retrieving-the-data">Retrieving the data</h1>

<p>FCS operates on assembled genome sequences and is not intended for use on raw reads. The following tutorial uses an assembled genome from yeast (<em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>) with contaminants artificially inserted into the genome. The first step is to retrieve the genome FASTA.</p>

<h2 id="upload-the-genome-fasta-from-zenodo">Upload the genome FASTA from Zenodo</h2>

<p>The following steps provide instructions to upload the test dataset into your Galaxy instance.</p>

<h2 id="interpreting-fcs-output">Interpreting FCS Output</h2>

<p>Running NCBI FCS on Galaxy is dependent on loading a large reference database on an adequate host. Currently the database is not persistent, meaning run times may vary. Most runs <em>should</em> complete in around one hour.</p>

<p>After the workflow is completed, you will be able to visualize tables of identified contaminants and can access FASTA files of clean sequences separated from contaminants.</p>

If you want to hardmask these regions instead, you must download the tabular adaptor report, convert <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ACTION_TRIM</code> values to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FIX</code>, and run the FCS-GX <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clean</code> tool separately.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In this example, we removed 200 contaminant sequences from non-target organisms using FCS-GX and removed 16 internal adaptor sequences using FCS-adaptor, producing a cleaned yeast genome. Following contamination detection, we can perform separate validation checks to support the removal of these sequences from our assembly. One example is to perform BLAST searches or NUCmer alignments against reference genomes of the same or closely related species.</p>
