We need a reference genome on which we map the reads.

> > 1. A reference genome (or reference assembly) is a DNA sequence assembled as a representative example of a species' DNA sequence. As they are often assembled from the sequencing of the DNA from different donors, they do not accurately represent the set of genes of any single person but a mosaic of different DNA sequences from each donor.
> > 2. As the cost of DNA sequencing falls, and new full genome sequencing technologies emerge, more genome sequences continue to be generated. Using these new sequences, new alignments are builts and the reference genomes improved (fewer gaps, fixed misrepresentations in the sequence, etc). The different reference genomes correspond to the different versions released (named build)
