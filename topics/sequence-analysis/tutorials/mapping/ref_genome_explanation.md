> > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
> > 1. A reference genome (or reference assembly) is a set of nucleic acid sequences assembled as a representative example of a species' genetic material. As they are often assembled from the sequencing of different individuals, they do not accurately represent the set of genes of any single organism, but a mosaic of different nucleic acid sequences from each individual.
> > 2. As the cost of DNA sequencing falls, and new full genome sequencing technologies emerge, more genome sequences continue to be generated. Using these new sequences, new alignments are built and the reference genomes improved (fewer gaps, fixed misrepresentations in the sequence, etc). The different reference genomes correspond to the different released versions (called "builds").
