description: >-
  To map DNA/RNA reads of an experiment to a reference genome is a key step in
  modern genomic data analysis. With the mapping the reads are assigned to a
  specific location in the genome and insights like the expression level of
  genes can be gained. In the following we will process a dataset with a mapper,
  ‘Bowtie2’, and we will visualize the data with the software ‘IGV’.

      The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance visualization
      tool for interactive exploration of large, integrated genomic datasets. It
      supports a wide variety of data types, including array-based and
      next-generation sequence data, and genomic annotations. In the following
      we will use it to visualize the computed mapping.

      To show you the difference between a good and a bad dataset we provided an
      additional dataset which will give you a bad mapping. Load the <a
