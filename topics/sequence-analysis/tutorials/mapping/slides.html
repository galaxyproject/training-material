questions:
  - What two things are crucial for a correct mapping?
  - What is BAM?
objectives:
  - You will learn what mapping is
  - A genome browser is shown that helps you to understand your data
time_estimation: "1h"
key_points:
  - Know your data!
  - Mapping is not trivial
  - There are many mapping algorithms, it depends on your data which one to choose

- Know your data!
- Maybe not the "best" result is the one you are searching for
- Try different mappers
