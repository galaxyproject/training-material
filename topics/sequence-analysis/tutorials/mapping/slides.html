### <img class="emoji" title=":grey_question:" alt=":grey_question:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2754.png" height="20" width="20"> Questions


- What two things are crucial for a correct mapping?

- What is BAM?


---

### <img class="emoji" title=":dart:" alt=":dart:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f3af.png" height="20" width="20"> Objectives


- You will learn what mapping is

- A genome browser is shown that helps you to understand your data


---

# What is mapping?

---

# Mapping

- Search the position of a read in the genome

# Looks easy...

Lego time: Who wants to volunteer?

---

- Know your data!
- Maybe not the "best" result is the one you are searching for
- Try different mappers

---

## Tools, tools, tools

- Bowtie
- HISAT
- MAQ
- BWA
- Eland
- SOAP
- STAR
- BISMARCK

And many more!

- Know your data!

- Mapping is not trivial

- There are many mapping algorithms, it depends on your data which one to choose
