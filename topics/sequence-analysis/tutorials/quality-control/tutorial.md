# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

During sequencing, the sequencer is sequencing each fragment of the library and generating a short sequence, also called a **read**: a succession of nucleotides.

Modern sequencing technologies can generate a massive number of sequence reads in a single experiment. However, no sequencing technology is perfect, and each instrument will generate different types and amounts of error, such as incorrect nucleotides being called. These are due to the technical limitations of each sequencing platform. 

Therefore, it is necessary to understand, identify and exclude error-types that may impact the interpretation of downstream analysis.
Sequence quality control is therefore an essential first step in your analysis. Catching errors early saves time later on.

We just imported a file into Galaxy. This file is similar the data we could get directly from a sequencing facility: a FASTQ file.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Inspect the FASTQ file

{: .hands_on}

Although it looks complicated (and maybe it is), the FASTQ format is easy to understand with a little decoding. 

Each read, representing a fragment of the library, is encoded by 4 lines:

Line  | Description
--- | ---
1 | Always begins with `@` and then information about the read
2 | The actual nucleic sequence
3 | Always begins with a `+` and sometimes the same info in line 1
4 | Has a string of characters which represent the quality scores associated with each base of the nucleic sequence; must have the same number of characters as line 2

So for example, the first sequence in our file is:

```
@SRR031716.1 HWI-EAS299_4_30M2BAAXX:3:1:944:1798 length=37
GTGGATATGGATATCCAAATTATATTTGCATAATTTG
+SRR031716.1 HWI-EAS299_4_30M2BAAXX:3:1:944:1798 length=37
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII8IIIIIII
```

It means that the fragment named `SRR031716.1` corresponds to the DNA sequence `GTGGATATGGATATCCAAATTATATTTGCATAATTTG` and this sequence has been sequenced with a quality `IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII8IIIIIII`.

But what does this quality mean?

The quality for each sequence is a string of characters, one for each base of the nucleic sequence, used to characterize the probability of mis-indentification of each base. The score is encoded using the ASCII character table (with some historical differences):

```
 SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.....................................................  Sanger
 ..........................XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX......................  Solexa
 ...............................IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII......................  Illumina 1.3+
 .................................JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ......................  Illumina 1.5+
 LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL....................................................  Illumina 1.8+

33                        59   64       73                            104                   126
 0........................26...31.......40                                
                          -5....0........9.............................40 
                                0........9.............................40 
                                   3.....9.............................40 
 0.2......................26...31........41
```

So each nucleotide is assigned an ASCII character, representing its [Phred quality score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score), the probability of an incorrect base call:

Phred Quality Score | Probability of incorrect base call | Base call accuracy
--- | --- | ---
10 | 1 in 10 | 90%
20 | 1 in 100 | 99%
30 | 1 in 1000 | 99.9%
40 | 1 in 10,000 | 99.99%
50 | 1 in 100,000 | 99.999%
60 | 1 in 1,000,000 | 99.9999%

When looking at the file in Galaxy, it looks like most the nucleotides have a high score (`I` corresponding to a score 40). Is it true for all sequences? And along the full sequence length?

# Assess the Read Quality

To estimate sequence quality along all sequences, we now use [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). It is an open-source tool that provides a simple way to quality control raw sequence data. It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick impression of whether your data has any problems of which you should be aware before doing any further analysis.

{: .hands_on}

Rather than looking at quality scores for each individual read, FastQC looks at quality collectively across all reads within a sample:

![Per base sequence quality](../../images/quality-control/per_base_sequence_quality.png "Per base sequence quality")

On the x-axis are the base position in the read, and on the y-axis quality scores. In this example, the sample contains reads that are 37 bp long. For each position, there is a box plotted to illustrate the distribution of values (with the whiskers indicating the 90th and 10th percentile scores). The blue line represents the mean score at the postion. The plot background is color-coded to identify good (green), acceptable (yellow), and bad (red) quality scores. 

> ### {% icon question %} Questions

FastQC produces other diagnostic plots to assess sample quality.

It is often the case that a subset of sequences will have universally poor quality, often because they are poorly imaged (on the edge of the field of view etc), however these should represent only a small percentage of the total sequences.

The graph enables you to look at the quality scores from each tile across all of your bases to see if there was a loss in quality associated with only one part of the flowcell.
>      
>      The plot shows the deviation from the average quality for each tile. The colours are on a cold to hot scale, with cold colours being positions where the quality was at, or above, the average for that base in the run, and hotter colours indicate that a tile had worse qualities than other tiles for that base. In the example above you can see that certain tiles show consistently poor quality. A good plot should be blue all over.

> 
>     It's worth noting that some types of library will always produce biased sequence composition, normally at the start of the read. Libraries produced by priming using random hexamers (including nearly all RNA-Seq libraries), and those which were fragmented using transposases, will contain an intrinsic bias in the positions at which reads start. This bias does not involve a specific sequence, but instead provides enrichment of a number of different K-mers at the 5' end of the reads. Whilst this is a true technical bias, it isn't something which can be corrected by trimming and in most cases doesn't seem to adversely affect the downstream analysis. It will, however, produce a warning or error in this module.

> 
>     An unusually-shaped distribution could indicate a contaminated library or some other kind of biased subset. A normal distribution which is shifted indicates some systematic bias, which is independent of base position. If there is a systematic bias which creates a shifted normal distribution then this won't be flagged as an error by the module since it doesn't know what your genome's GC content should be.

> 
>     In a properly diverse library most sequences should fall into the far left of the plot in both the red and blue lines. A general level of enrichment, indicating broad oversequencing in the library will tend to flatten the lines, lowering the low end and generally raising other categories. More specific enrichments of subsets, or the presence of low complexity contaminants will tend to produce spikes towards the right of the plot. These high duplication peaks will most often appear in the blue trace as they make up a high proportion of the original library, but usually disappear in the red trace as they make up an insignificant proportion of the deduplicated set. If peaks persist in the blue trace then this suggests that there are a large number of different highly duplicated sequences which might indicate either a contaminant set or a very severe technical duplication.

>      A normal high-throughput library will contain a diverse set of sequences, with no individual sequence making up a tiny fraction of the whole.

>      
>      FastQC lists all of the sequence which make up more than 0.1% of the total. For each overrepresented sequence FastQC will look for matches in a database of common contaminants and will report the best hit it finds. Hits must be at least 20bp in length and have no more than 1 mismatch. Finding a hit doesn't necessarily mean that this is the source of the contamination, but may point you in the right direction. It's also worth pointing out that many adapter sequences are very similar to each other so you may get a hit reported which isn't technically correct, but which has very similar sequence to the actual match.

# Trim and filter

Based on the information provided by the quality graphs, the quality of the sequences drops at the end of the sequences. It could cause bias in downstream analyis with these potentially wrong nucleotides.

The sequences should be treated to reduce bias in downstream analyis. In general, quality treatments include:

- Filtering of sequences
    - with low mean quality score
    - too short
    - with too many ambiguous (N) bases
    - based on their GC content
- Cutting/Trimming/masking sequences
    - from low quality score regions
    - beginning/end of sequence
    - removing adapters

To accomplish this task we use the [Trim Galore!](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) tool. This tool is a wrapper for the [Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html) tool that enhances sequence quality by automating adapter trimming as well as quality control.

The quality of the previous dataset was pretty good from the beginning and we improved it with wth trimming and filtering step (in a reasonable way to not lose too much information)

# Process paired-end data

With paired-end sequencing, the fragments are sequenced from both sides. This approach results in two reads per fragment, with the first read in forward orientation and the second read in reverse-complement orientation. The distance between both reads is known and therefore is additional information that can improve read mapping.

With paired-end sequencing, more of each DNA fragment can be covered than with single-end sequencing (only forward orientation sequenced):

```
    ------>
      ------>
        ------>
          ------>

    ----------------------------- [fragment]

    ------>         <------
      ------>         <------
        ------>         <------
          ------>         <------
```

Paired-end sequencing generates 2 FASTQ files:
- One file with the sequences corresponding to foward orientation of all the fragments
- One file with the sequences corresponding to reverse orientation of all the fragments

The data we analyzed in the previous step was not single-end data but the forward reads of paired-end data. We will now do the quality control on both forward and reverse reads together.

It is usual that the quality of the sequences is worse for the reverse than for the forward reads. It makes it even important to treat the forward and reverse reads together.

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

In this tutorial we checked the quality of two FASTQ files to ensure that their data looks good before inferring any further information. This step is the usual first step for analyses such as RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, or any other OMIC analysis relying on NGS data. Quality control steps are similar for any type of sequencing data:

- Quality assessment with a tool like **FastQC** {% icon tool %}
- Trimming and filtering with a tool like **Trim Galore!** {% icon tool %}
