# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

During the sequencing process, some errors may be introduced like incorporation of ambiguous nucleotides. Analyzing poor data wastes CPU and people time.

The quality control of the sequences right after sequencing is then an essential step to ensure that the raw data looks good before processing them. It reduces the biases in data that may compromised the downstream analyses with low-quality sequences, sequence artifacts, ... The process is the same for any type of sequencing data.

# Quality checking of the sequences

To estimate sequence quality and treatments to do on the data, many indicators can be checked:

- Quality score of the sequences with
    - Per base sequence quality
    - Per sequence quality scores
    - Per tile sequence quality
- Sequence content with
    - Per base sequence content
    - Per sequence GC content
    - Per base N content
- Sequence length with the sequence length distribution
- Duplicated sequences
- Tag sequences with
    - Adapter contamination
    - Kmer Content

[FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) is an open-source tool provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It generates quality graphics and estimates numerous quality informations and threshold. For each studied indicators, FastQC providing a quick overview to tell in which areas there may be problems.

# Improvement of the quality of the sequences

Based on previous quality graphs, sequences must be treated to obtain good dataset and then the bias in downstream analysis.

In general, quality treatments are:

- Filtering of sequences
    - with small mean quality score
    - too small
    - with too many N bases
    - based on their GC content
    - ...
- Cutting/Trimming sequences
    - from low quality score parts
    - tails
    - ...

To improve the quality of the sequences, we use [Trim Galore!](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) tool. It automates quality and adapter trimming as well as quality control.

The quality of the previous dataset was pretty good from beginning. The quality treatment improved the quality score but to the cost of other parameters.

# Control the quality of a second dataset

Now, we would like to see the impact to quality control and treatment on a bad dataset.

>    >    <li>Generally, 5' ends of the reads are not of bad quality unless there is something went wrong. The problem with this particular data set is that it was sequenced using the old Illumina sequencing machine. The machine calibrates while reading fragments that are in the beginning of the flowcell. Unfortunately, the first 100k reads which we selected for the analysis are generated during the calibration. But with the latest sequencing machines, usually we do not see this problem. If you used latest sequencing machine and still see bad quality bases in the beginning of the reads, please investigate and not just trim them.</li>

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

In this tutorial, we have controlled the quality of two datasets to ensure that the raw data looks good before analysing them with tools to extract RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq or any other type of information. The approach of quality control is similar for any type of sequencing data:
