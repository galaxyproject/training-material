# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

During sequencing, the nucleotide bases in a DNA or RNA sample (library) are determined by the sequencer. For each fragment in the library, a short sequence is generated, also called a **read**, which is simply a succession of nucleotides.

Modern sequencing technologies can generate a massive number of sequence reads in a single experiment. However, no sequencing technology is perfect, and each instrument will generate different types and amount of errors, such as incorrect nucleotides being called. These wrongly called bases are due to the technical limitations of each sequencing platform.

Therefore, it is necessary to understand, identify and exclude error-types that may impact the interpretation of downstream analysis.
Sequence quality control is therefore an essential first step in your analysis. Catching errors early saves time later on.

We just imported a file into Galaxy. This file is similar to the data we could get directly from a sequencing facility: a [FASTQ file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format).

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Inspect the FASTQ file
>
> 1. Inspect the file by clicking on the {% icon galaxy-eye %} (eye) icon

{: .hands_on}

Although it looks complicated (and maybe it is), the FASTQ format is easy to understand with a little decoding.

Each read, representing a fragment of the library, is encoded by 4 lines:

Line  | Description
--- | ---
1 | Always begins with `@` followed by the information about the read
2 | The actual nucleic sequence
3 | Always begins with a `+` and contains sometimes the same info in line 1
4 | Has a string of characters which represent the quality scores associated with each base of the nucleic sequence; must have the same number of characters as line 2

So for example, the first sequence in our file is:

```
@SRR031716.1 HWI-EAS299_4_30M2BAAXX:3:1:944:1798 length=37
GTGGATATGGATATCCAAATTATATTTGCATAATTTG
+SRR031716.1 HWI-EAS299_4_30M2BAAXX:3:1:944:1798 length=37
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII8IIIIIII
```

It means that the fragment named `SRR031716.1` corresponds to the DNA sequence `GTGGATATGGATATCCAAATTATATTTGCATAATTTG` and this sequence has been sequenced with a quality `IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII8IIIIIII`.

But what does this quality score mean?

The quality score for each sequence is a string of characters, one for each base of the nucleic sequence, used to characterize the probability of mis-identification of each base. The score is encoded using the ASCII character table (with [some historical differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format#Encoding)):

![Encoding of the quality score with ASCII characters for different Phred encoding](../../images/quality_score_encoding.png)

So there is an ASCII character associated with each nucleotide, representing its [Phred quality score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score), the probability of an incorrect base call:

Phred Quality Score | Probability of incorrect base call | Base call accuracy
--- | --- | ---
10 | 1 in 10 | 90%
20 | 1 in 100 | 99%
30 | 1 in 1000 | 99.9%
40 | 1 in 10,000 | 99.99%

{: .comment}

When looking at the file in Galaxy, it looks like most the nucleotides have a high score (`I` corresponding to a score 40). Is it true for all sequences? And along the full sequence length?

# Assess the Read Quality

To estimate sequence quality along all sequences, we now use [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). It is an open-source tool that provides a simple way to quality control raw sequence data. It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick impression of whether your data has any problems of which you should be aware before doing any further analysis.

## Per base sequence quality

Rather than looking at quality scores for each individual read, FastQC looks at quality collectively across all reads within a sample:

![Per base sequence quality](../../images/quality-control/per_base_sequence_quality.png "Per base sequence quality")

On the x-axis are the base position in the read. In this example, the sample contains reads that are 37 bp long.

> ### {% icon details %} Non uniform x-axis
>
> The x-axis is not always uniform. When you have long reads, some binning is applied to keep things compact:
>
> ![Per base sequence quality](../../images/quality-control/per_base_sequence_quality_binned.png "Per base sequence quality with binned reads")
>
> It starts out with individual 1-10 bases. After that, bases are binned across a window a certain number of bases wide. Data binning means grouping and is a data pre-processing technique used to reduce the effects of minor observation errors. The number of base positions binned together depends on the length of the read. With 150 bp reads, the latter part of the plot will report aggregate statistics for 5bp windows. Shorter reads will have smaller windows and longer reads larger windows.
>
> Binning can be removed when running FastQC
{: .details}

For each position, a boxplot is drawn with:

- the median value, represented by the central red line
- the inter-quartile range (25-75%), represented by the yellow box
- the 10% and 90% values in the upper and lower whiskers
- the mean quality, represented by the blue line

The y-axis shows the quality scores. The higher the score, the better the base call. The background of the  graph divides the y-axis into very good quality scores (green), scores of reasonable quality (orange), and reads of poor quality (red).

It is normal with all Illumina sequencers for the median quality score to start out lower over the first 5-7 bases and to then rise. The quality of reads on most platforms will drop at the end of the read. This is often due to signal decay or phasing during the sequencing run. The recent developments in chemistry applied to sequencing has improved this somewhat, but reads are now longer than ever.


> ### {% icon details %} Signal decay and phasing
>
> - Signal decay
>
>  The fluorescent signal intensity decays with each cycle of the sequencing process. Due to the degrading fluorophores, a proportion of the strands in the cluster are not being elongated. The proportion of the signal being emitted continues to decrease with each cycle, yielding to a decrease of quality scores at the 3' end of the read.
>
> - Phasing
>
>  The signal starts to blur with the increase of number of cycles because the cluster looses synchronicity. As the cycles progress, some strands get random failures of nucleotides to incorporate due to:
>
>  - Incomplete removal of the 3' terminators and fluorophores
>  - Incorporation of nucleotides without effective 3' terminators
>
>  This leads to a decrease in quality scores at the 3' end of the read.

>
>   Sequencing facilities can overcluster the flow cells. It results in small distances between clusters and an overlap in the signals. Two clusters can be interpreted as a single cluster with mixed fluorescent signals being detected, decreasing signal purity. It generates lower quality scores across the entire read.
>
> - Instrumentation breakdown
>
>   Some issues can occasionally happen with the sequencing instruments during a run. Any sudden drop in quality or a large percentage of low quality reads across the read could indicate a problem at the facility. Some examples of such issues:

{: .question}

When the median quality is below a Phred score of ~20, we should consider trimming away bad quality bases from the sequence. We will explain that process in the next section.

FastQC produces other diagnostic plots to assess sample quality.

## Per sequence quality scores

It plots the average quality score over the full length of all reads on the x-axis and gives the total number of reads with this score on the y-axis:

![Per sequence quality scores](../../images/quality-control/per_sequence_quality_scores.png "Per sequence quality scores")

The distribution of average read quality should be tight peak in the upper range of the plot. It can also report if a subset of the sequences have universally low quality values: it can happen because some sequences are poorly imaged (on the edge of the field of view etc), however these should represent only a small percentage of the total sequences.

## Per base sequence content

![Per base sequence content](../../images/quality-control/per_base_sequence_content.png "Per base sequence content for a DNA library")

"Per Base Sequence Content" plots the percentage of each of the four nucleotides (T, C, A, G) at each position across all reads in the input sequence file. As for the per base sequence quality, the x-axis is non-uniform.

In a random library we would expect that there would be little to no difference between the four bases. The proportion of each of the four bases should remain relatively constant over the length of the read with `%A=%T` and `%G=%C`, and the lines in this plot should run parallel with each other.

> ### {% icon details %} Biases by library type
>
> It's worth noting that some library types will always produce biased sequence composition, normally at the start of the read. Libraries produced by priming using random hexamers (including nearly all RNA-Seq libraries as in the previous plot), and those which were fragmented using transposases, will contain an intrinsic bias in the positions at which reads start (the first 10-12 bases). This bias does not involve a specific sequence, but instead provides enrichment of a number of different K-mers at the 5' end of the reads. Whilst this is a true technical bias, it isn't something which can be corrected by trimming and in most cases doesn't seem to adversely affect the downstream analysis. It will, however, produce a warning or error in this module.

> ChIP-seq data can also encounter read start sequence biases in this plot if fragmenting with transposases. With bisulphite converted data, e.g. HiC data, a separation of G from C and A from T is expected:
>
> ![Per base sequence content for Bisulphite data](../../images/quality-control/per_base_sequence_content_bisulphite.png)
>
> At the end, there is an overall shift in the sequence composition. If the shift correlates with a loss of sequencing quality, it can be suspected that miscalls are made with a more even sequence bias than bisulphite converted libraries.  Trimming the sequences fixed this problem, but if this hadn't been done it would have had a dramatic effect on the methylation calls which were made.

## Per sequence GC content

![Per sequence GC content](../../images/quality-control/per_sequence_gc_content.png "Per sequence GC content")

This plot displays the number of reads vs. percentage of bases G and C per read. It is compared to a theoretical distribution assuming an uniform GC content for all reads, expected for whole genome shotgun sequencing, where the central peak corresponds to the overall GC content of the underlying genome. Since the GC content of the genome is not known, the modal GC content is calculated from the observed data and used to build a reference distribution.

An unusually-shaped distribution could indicate a contaminated library or some other kind of biased subset. A shifted normal distribution indicates some systematic bias, which is independent of base position. If there is a systematic bias which creates a shifted normal distribution then this won't be flagged as an error by the module since it doesn't know what your genome's GC content should be.

But there are also other situations in which an unusually-shaped distribution may occur. For example, with RNA sequencing there may be a greater or lesser distribution of mean GC content among transcripts causing the observed plot to be wider or narrower than an ideal normal distribution.

## Sequence Duplication Levels

The graph shows in blue the percentage of reads of a given sequence in the file which are present a given number of times in the file:

![Sequence Duplication Levels](../../images/quality-control/sequence_duplication_levels.png "Sequence Duplication Levels")

In a diverse library most sequences will occur only once in the final set. A low level of duplication may indicate a very high level of coverage of the target sequence, but a high level of duplication is more likely to indicate some kind of enrichment bias.

Two sources of duplicate reads can be found:
- PCR duplication in which library fragments have been over-represented due to biased PCR enrichment

  It is a concern because PCR duplicates misrepresent the true proportion of sequences in the input.

- Truly over-represented sequences such as very abundant transcripts in an RNA-Seq library

  It is an expected case and not of concern because it does faithfully represent the input.

FastQC counts the degree of duplication for every sequence in a library and creates a plot showing the relative number of sequences with different degrees of duplication. There are two lines on the plot:
- Blue line: distribution of the duplication levels for the full sequence set
- Red line: distribution for the de-duplicated sequences with the proportions of the deduplicated set which come from different duplication levels in the original data.

For whole genome shotgun data it is expected that nearly 100% of your reads will be unique (appearing only 1 time in the sequence data). Most sequences should fall into the far left of the plot in both the red and blue lines. This indicates a highly diverse library that was not over sequenced. If the sequencing depth is extremely high (e.g. > 100x the size of the genome) some inevitable sequence duplication can appear: there are in theory only a finite number of completely unique sequence reads which can be obtained from any given input DNA sample.

More specific enrichments of subsets, or the presence of low complexity contaminants will tend to produce spikes towards the right of the plot. These high duplication peaks will most often appear in the blue trace as they make up a high proportion of the original library, but usually disappear in the red trace as they make up an insignificant proportion of the deduplicated set. If peaks persist in the red trace then this suggests that there are a large number of different highly duplicated sequences which might indicate either a contaminant set or a very severe technical duplication.

It is usually the case for RNA sequencing where there is some very highly abundant transcripts and some lowly abundant. It is expected that duplicate reads will be observed for high abundance transcripts:

![Sequence Duplication Levels for RNA-seq](../../images/quality-control/sequence_duplication_levels_rna_seq.png)

## Over-represented sequences

A normal high-throughput library will contain a diverse set of sequences, with no individual sequence making up a tiny fraction of the whole. Finding that a single sequence is very over-represented in the set either means that it is highly biologically significant, or indicates that the library is contaminated, or not as diverse as expected.

FastQC lists all of the sequence which make up more than 0.1% of the total. For each over-represented sequence FastQC will look for matches in a database of common contaminants and will report the best hit it finds. Hits must be at least 20bp in length and have no more than 1 mismatch. Finding a hit doesn't necessarily mean that this is the source of the contamination, but may point you in the right direction. It's also worth pointing out that many adapter sequences are very similar to each other so you may get a hit reported which isn't technically correct, but which has a very similar sequence to the actual match.

With DNA sequencing data no single sequence should be present at a high enough frequency to be listed, but we can sometimes see a small percentage of adapter reads. RNA sequencing data may have some transcripts that are so abundant that they register as over-represented sequence.

> This plot will only appear for Illumina library which retains its original sequence identifiers. Encoded in these is the flowcell tile from which each read came. The plot enables you to look at the quality scores from each tile across all of your bases to see if there was a loss in quality associated with only one part of the flowcell.
>
> The plot shows the deviation from the average quality for each tile. The hotter colours indicate that reads in the given tile have worse qualities for that position than reads in other tiles. In the example above you can see that certain tiles show consistently poor quality. A good plot should be blue all over.
>
> In some cases, the chemicals used during sequencing becoming a bit exhausted over the time and the last tiles got worst chemicals which makes the sequencing reactions a bit error-prone. The "Per tile sequence quality" graph will then have some horizontal lines like this:

> It's not unusual to see a very high proportion of Ns appearing in a sequence, especially near the end of a sequence. But this curve should never rises noticeably above zero. If it does this indicates a problem occurred during the sequencing run.

Even within uniform length libraries some pipelines will trim sequences to remove poor quality base calls from the end or the first $n$ bases if they match the first $n$ bases of the adapter up to 90% (by default), with sometimes $n = 1$.

>
> Ideally Illumina sequence data should not have any adapter sequence present. But with when using long read, some of the library inserts are shorter than the read length resulting in read-through to the adapter at the 3' end of the read. This is more likely to occur with RNA-Seq libraries where the distribution of library insert sizes is more varied and likely to include some short inserts. In the example below, a high quality RNA-Seq library have a small percentage of the library with inserts smaller than 150bp:

>
> FastQC will report the list of kmers which appear at specific positions with a greater frequency than expected. This can be due to different sources of bias in the library, including the presence of read-through adapter sequences building up on the end of the sequences. The presence of any overrepresented sequences in the library (such as adapter dimers) causes the kmer plot to be dominated by the kmer from these sequences. Any biased kmer due to other interesting biases may be then diluted and not easy to see.

# Filter and Trim

The quality of the sequences drops at the end of the sequences. This could cause bias in downstream analyses with these potentially incorrectly called nucleotides. Sequences must be treated to reduce bias in downstream analysis. In general, quality treatments include:

1. Cutting/Trimming/masking sequences
    - from low quality score regions
    - beginning/end of sequence
    - removing adapters
2. Filtering of sequences
    - with low mean quality score
    - too short
    - with too many ambiguous (N) bases

To accomplish this task we will use [Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html), a tool that enhances sequence quality by automating adapter trimming as well as quality control.

The quality of the previous dataset was pretty good from the beginning and we improved it with with trimming and filtering step (in a reasonable way to not lose too much information)

> ### {% icon comment %} Bad quality sequences

> Note that thereby also positions with a quality value larger than the chosen threshold are removed if they are embedded in regions with lower quality (the partial sum is decreasing if the quality values are smaller than the threshold). The advantage of this procedure is that it is robust against a small number of positions with a quality higher than the threshold.

>     The sliding window approach checks that the average quality of each sequence window of specified length is larger than the threshold. Note that in contrast to cutadapt's approach, this approach has one more parameter and the robustness depends of the length of the window (in combination with the quality threshold). Both approaches are implemented in Trimmomatic.

# Process paired-end data

With paired-end sequencing, the fragments are sequenced from both sides. This approach results in two reads per fragment, with the first read in forward orientation and the second read in reverse-complement orientation. With this technique, we have the advantage to get more information about each DNA fragment compared to reads sequenced by only single-end sequencing:

```
    ------>                       [single-end]

    ----------------------------- [fragment]

    ------>               <------ [paired-end]
```
The distance between both reads is known and therefore is additional information that can improve read mapping.

Paired-end sequencing generates 2 FASTQ files:
- One file with the sequences corresponding to **forward** orientation of all the fragments
- One file with the sequences corresponding to **reverse** orientation of all the fragments

Usually we recognize these two files which belong to one sample by the name which has the same identifier for the reads but a different extension, e.g. `sampleA_R1.fastq` for the forward reads and `sampleA_R2.fastq` for the reverse reads. It can also be `_f` or `_1` for the forward reads and `_r` or `_2` for the reverse reads.

The data we analyzed in the previous step was not single-end data but the forward reads of paired-end data. We will now do the quality control on the reverse reads.

{: .question}

With paired-end reads the average quality scores for forward reads will almost always be higher than for reverse reads.

After trimming, reverse reads will be shorter because of their quality and then will be eliminated during the filtering step. If one of the reverse reads is removed, its corresponding forward read should be removed too. Otherwise we will get different number of reads in both files and in different order, and order is important for the next steps. Therefore **it is important to treat the forward and reverse reads together for trimming and filtering**.

In addition to the report, Cutadapt generates 2 files:
- Read 1 with the trimmed and filtered forward reads
- Read 2 with the trimmed and filtered reverse reads

These datasets can be used for the downstream analysis, e.g. mapping.

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

In this tutorial we checked the quality of two FASTQ files to ensure that their data looks good before inferring any further information. This step is the usual first step for analyses such as RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, or any other OMIC analysis relying on NGS data. Quality control steps are similar for any type of sequencing data:

- Quality assessment with a tool like **FastQC** {% icon tool %}
- Trimming and filtering with a tool like **Cutadapt** {% icon tool %}
