# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

During sequencing, errors are introduced, such as incorrect nucleotides being called. These are due to the technical limitations of each sequencing platform. Sequencing errors might bias the analysis, ultimately leading to a misinterpretation of the data. 

Sequence quality control is therefore an essential first step in your analysis. Catching errors early saves time later on.

# Quality check

To estimate sequence quality and how to filter raw data, different indicators can be checked:

- Quality score of the sequences with
    - Per-base sequence quality
    - Per-sequence quality scores
- Sequence content with
    - Per-base sequence content
    - Per-sequence GC content
    - Per-base N content
- Sequence length with the sequence length distribution
- Duplicated sequences
- Tag sequences with
    - Adapter contamination
    - K-mer content

[FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) is an open-source tool that provides a simple way to quality control raw sequence data. It removes reads with low quality scores, and generates graphics and estimates providing a quick overview about which data might be the source of bias in the analysis.

# Improvement of sequence quality

Based on the information provided by the quality graphs, the sequences should be treated to reduce bias in downstream analyis.

In general, quality treatments include:

- Filtering of sequences
    - with low mean quality score
    - too short
    - with too many ambiguous (N) bases
    - based on their GC content
- Cutting/Trimming/masking sequences
    - from low quality score regions
    - beginning/end of sequence
    - removing adapters

To improve the overall sequence quality, we use the [Trim Galore!](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) tool. This tool enhances sequence quality by automating adapter trimming as well as quality control.

The quality of the previous dataset was pretty good from beginning. The sequence quality treatment improved the quality score at the cost of other parameters.

# Impact of quality control

Now, we take a look at the impact of quality control and treatment on a bad dataset.

>    > 2. What needs to be done to improve the sequences?
>    >
>    >    > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
>    >    > 1. There is a red warning on the per-base sequence quality (pretty bad along the sequence but worse at the end of sequences), the per-base sequence content (bad at the beginning of the sequences), and the per-sequence GC content
>    >    > 2. The end of sequences must be cut.
>    >    > 3. Generally, the 5' end of each sequence read is not of bad quality unless something went wrong with the sequencng experiment itself. Here, the problem is that the sample was sequenced using the an Illumina sequencing machine, which carries out its calibration while reading fragments that are in the beginning of the flowcell. Unfortunately, the first 100k reads which we selected for the analysis are generated during the calibration, a problem that we don't have with more recent sequencing machines. However, if you adopted one of the latest sequencing machine and still experience bad quality bases at the beginning of the reads, please don't just trim them, but consider investigating the problem further.

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

In this tutorial we checked the quality of two datasets to ensure that their data looks good before inferring any further information. This step is the baseline for any pipeline analysis such as RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, or any other OMIC analysis relying on NGS data. Quality control steps are similar for any type of sequencing data:
