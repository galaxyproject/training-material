# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

During sequencing, errors might be introduced, such as the incorporation of ambiguous nucleotides. These are due to the technical limitations of each sequencing platform. Sequencing errors might bias the analysis, ultimately leading to a misinterpretation of the data.

Sequence quality control is therefore an essential step to take right after receiving the raw sequencing data. This ensures proper, analysis regardless the sequencing platform used to obtain the data.

# Quality check

To estimate sequence quality and how to further filter raw data, different indicators can be checked:

- Quality score of the sequences with
    - Per-base sequence quality
    - Per-sequence quality scores
    - Per-tile sequence quality
- Sequence content with
    - Per-base sequence content
    - Per-sequence GC content
    - Per-base N content
- Sequence length with the sequence length distribution
- Duplicated sequences
- Tag sequences with
    - Adapter contamination
    - K-mer content

[FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) is an open-source tool that provides a simple way to quality-control raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It gets rid of low quality score reads, and generates graphics and estimates providing a quick overview about which data might be the source of bias in the analysis.

# Improvement of sequence quality

Based on the informations provided by the quality graphs, the sequences must to be treated to avoid bias in downstream analyis.

In general, quality treatments are:

- Filtering of sequences
    - with small mean quality score
    - too small
    - with too many N bases
    - based on their GC content
    - ...
- Cutting/Trimming sequences
    - from low quality score parts
    - tails
    - ...

To improve the overall sequence quality, we use the [Trim Galore!](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) tool. This tool enhances sequence quality by automating adapter trimming as well as quality control.

The quality of the previous dataset was pretty good from beginning. The sequence quality treatment improved the quality score at the cost of other parameters.

# Impact of quality control

Now, we take a look at the impact of quality control and treatment on a bad dataset.

>    >    <li>Generally, the 5' end of each sequence read is not of bad quality unless something went wrong. Here, the problem is that the sample was sequenced using the an Illumina sequencing machine, which carries out its calibration while reading fragments that are in the beginning of the flowcell. Unfortunately, the first 100k reads which we selected for the analysis are generated during the calibration, a problem that we don't have with more recent sequencing machines. However, if you adopted one of the latest sequencing machine and still experience bad quality bases at the beginning of the reads, please don't just trim them, but consider investigating the problem further</li>

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

In this tutorial we checked the quality of two datasets to ensure that their data looks good before inferring any further information. This step is the baseline for any pipeline analysis such as RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, or any other OMIC analysis relying on NGS data. Quality control steps are similar for any type of sequencing data:
