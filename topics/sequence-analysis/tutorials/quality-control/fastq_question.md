> > 1. The DNA sequences are stored in a FASTQ file, in the second line of every 4-line group.
> > 2. This file format is called [FASTQ format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format). It stores sequence information and quality information. Each sequence is represented by a group of 4 lines with the 1st line being the sequence id, the second the sequence of nucleotides, the third a transition line and the last one a sequence of quality score for each nucleotide.
