	<h1 id="why-quality-control">Why Quality Control?</h1>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>

<p>Potential audience poll ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sequenced something or assembled a genome or transcriptome?</li>
  <li>Can guess why we need to do QC on our data?</li>
</ul>

<p>Comments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Process of removing low quality sequences that might corrupt downstream analyses</li>
  <li>Some assemblers like Spades have an auto-correction process and ask for raw data</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="where-is-my-data-coming-from">Where is my data coming from?</h3>

<p><img src="../../images/ecker_2012.png" alt="Cartoon of different types of sequencing and where they appear in the genome. Bisulfite and ChIP-Seq have arrows pointing to nucleosomes. DNaseq-seq points to the region between nucleosomes. Hi-C and ChIA-PET point to the long range chromatin interactions. RNA-Seq points to a subset of the genome showing a promoter and transcribed region." /></p>

<p><small><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22955614"><em>Ecker et al, Nature, 2012</em></a></small></p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>Many sequencing techniques</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.illumina.com/science/sequencing-method-explorer.html">Huge diversity in protocols</a></li>
  <li>Knowledge about source of data (+expectations of how it looks) is important in QC process</li>
  <li>What is/isn’t normal for your data</li>
</ul>

<p>Segue: Might be concerned about different processing for each</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="from-experiments-to-data">From experiments to data</h3>

<p><img src="../../images/from_exp_to_data.png" alt="RNA Seq, Exome Seq, ChIP-Seq, and DNA-Seq all point to a large sequencing box and produce files. Then come bioinformatic analysis, namely quality control, on all of the different types." /></p>

<p>Quality control = First step of the bioinformatics analyses</p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>But no matter what technique used, same file format</li>
  <li>Always should go through QC</li>
</ul>

<p>Segue: So let’s look at how that data is stored</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="sequences-fasta">Sequences: FASTA</h3>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;Identifier1 (comment)
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
&gt;Identifier2 (comment)
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XX
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>familiar if you’ve seen genomic data before</li>
  <li>Starts with greater-than sign</li>
  <li>Then an identifier with no spaces</li>
  <li>Everything after a space is a comment</li>
  <li>Newline</li>
  <li>Everything up to next greater-than is sequence data (wrapping unnecessary)</li>
</ul>

<p>Segue: But this is just sequence, and we have data from a sequencer, which includes quality</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="sequences-fastq">Sequences: FASTQ</h3>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@Identifier1 (comment)
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
+
QQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ
@Identifier2 (comment)
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
+
QQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>Four lines</li>
  <li>@ + identifier on first line, just like fasta</li>
  <li>sequence</li>
  <li>+</li>
  <li>quality score characters</li>
</ul>

<p>Segue: so what do the quality chars mean?</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="quality-score">Quality score</h3>

<p>Measure of the quality of the identification of the nucleobases <br />generated by automated DNA sequencing</p>

<p><small></small></p>

<h3 id="per-tile-quality">Per-tile Quality</h3>

<p><img src="../../images/per_tile_quality.png" alt="A heatmap with several red and green squares, but overall largely blue." /></p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span>
In Illumina libraries, the original sequence identifier is retained. Encoded in these is the flowcell tile from which each read came.</p>

<p>There might be transient problems such as bubbles going through the flowcell, or more permanent problems such as smudges on the flowcell, or debris inside the flowcell lane.</p>

<p>This graph will only appear with Illumina libraries which retain their original sequence identifiers. The graph allows to check the quality scores from each tile across all bases, to see if there was a loss in quality associated with only one portion of the flowcell. The plot shows the deviation from the average quality for each tile. The colours are on a cold to hot scale, with cold colours being positions where the quality was at or below the average for that base in the run, and hot colours to indicate that a tile had worse quality reads than other tiles for that base. In the example below you can see that certain tiles show consistently poor quality. A good plot should be blue all over.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="per-base-sequence-content">Per-base Sequence Content</h3>

<p><img src="../../images/per_base_sequence_content.png" alt="A line chart mapping sequence content across all bases with % of the four nucleotides plotted. The graph starts off very jagged and stabilises by base 12." /></p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span>
The per-base sequence content highlights the proportion of each base in each position of a sequence for which each of the four DNA bases have been called. In a random library there would be little to no difference between the different bases of a sequence run. The relative amount of each base should reflect the overall amount of these bases, but in any case they should not be hugely imbalanced from one another. It is worth noting that some types of libraries will always produce biased sequence composition, normally at the start of the read. Libraries produced by priming with random hexamers (including nearly all RNA-Seq libraries) and those which were fragmented using transposases, inherit an intrinsic bias in the positions at which the reads start. This bias does not concern an absolute sequence, but instead provides an enrichment of a number of different K-mers at the 5’ end of the reads. Whilst this is a true technical bias, it isn’t something which can be corrected by trimming and in most cases doesn’t seem to adversely affect the downstream analysis. It will however produce a warning or error in this module.</p>

<p>There are a number of common scenarios for these issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Over-represented sequences</li>
  <li>Biased fragmentation</li>
  <li>Biased composition libraries</li>
  <li>Aggressive adapter trimming</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="per-sequence-gc-content">Per-sequence GC content</h3>

<p><img src="../../images/per_sequence_GC_content.png" alt="A line chart showing mean GC content and threoretical distribution as largely overlapping peaks." /></p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span>
The GC content distribution of most samples should follow a normal distribution. In some cases, a bi-modal distribution can be observed, especially for metagenomic data sets. An unusually shaped distribution could indicate a contaminated library or some other kinds of biased subset. A normal distribution which is shifted indicates some systematic bias which is independent of base position. Such a systematic bias creating a shifted normal distribution won’t be flagged as an error, since the tool cannot guess what the provided genome’s GC content should be.</p>

<p>Issues in the GC content distribution usually indicate a problem with the library. Sharp peaks on an otherwise smooth distribution are normally the result of a specific contaminant (adapter dimers for example), which may well be picked up by the over-represented sequences module. Broader peaks may represent contamination with a different species.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="per-base-n-content">Per-base N content</h3>

<p><img src="../../images/per_base_N_content.png" alt="A line graph of N content across all bases. It shows several peaks to 65 at specific positions and goes to 100 near the end." /></p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span>
Sequences can contain the ambiguous base N for positions that could not be identified as a particular base. A high number of Ns can be a sign for a low quality sequence or even dataset. If no quality scores are available, the sequence quality can be inferred from the percent of Ns found in a sequence or dataset.</p>

<p>If a sequencer is unable to make a base call with sufficient confidence then it will normally substitute an N rather than a conventional base call. It’s not unusual to see a very low proportion of Ns appearing in a sequence, especially nearer the end of a sequence. However, if this proportion rises above a few percent it suggests that the analysis pipeline was unable to interpret the data well enough to make valid base calls.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="sequence-length-distribution">Sequence length distribution</h3>

<p><img src="../../images/sequence_length_distribution.png" alt="A graph with a single peak at 75, and 0 outside of this region." /></p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span>
Some high throughput sequencers generate sequence fragments of uniform length, while others can output reads of wildly varying lengths. The length distribution can be then used as quality measure. You would expect a normal distribution for the best result. However, most sequencing results show a slowly increasing and then a steep falling distribution.</p>

<p>FastQC generates a graph showing the distribution of fragment sizes in the file which was analysed. In many cases this will produce a simple graph showing a peak only at one size, but for variable length FASTQ files this will show the relative amounts of each different size of sequence fragment.</p>

<p>This module will raise a warning if all sequences are not the same length. This module will raise an error if any of the sequences have zero length.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="sequence-length-distribution---pacbio--nanopore">Sequence length distribution - PacBio / Nanopore</h3>

<p><img src="../../images/sequence_length_distribution_long-reads.png" alt="A graph with a main peak around 15,000bp for PacBio HiFi run." /></p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>

<p>For long reads, the distribution is much more important and depends on the fragment size selection, primers, DNA weight and quality, etc</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="duplicated-sequences">Duplicated sequences</h3>

<p><img src="../../images/sequence_duplication_levels.png" alt="Two line graphs, deduplicated sequences in red, and total sequences in blue. They start off near 100 and go rapidly to zero by sequence duplication level 2 and 3." /></p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span>
This quality check module counts the degree of duplication for every sequence in the library, and creates a plot showing the relative number of sequences with different degrees of duplication:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the blue line represents the full sequence set, showing how its duplication levels are distributed;</li>
  <li>the red line represents the de-duplicated sequences, plotting the proportions of deduplicated sequence sets which come from different duplication levels in the original data.</li>
</ul>

<p>In genomic projects, sequence duplication is investigated. Duplicated sequences can arise when there are too few fragments present at any stage prior to sequencing.</p>

<p>This module issues a warning if non-unique sequences make up for more than 20% of the total sequences. An error is raised instead if non-unique sequences make up for more than 50% of the total.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="tag-sequences-adapter-contamination">Tag sequences: Adapter contamination</h3>

<p><img src="../../images/adapter_content.png" alt="The graph shows a line at zero for the five possible datasets." /></p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span>
Tag sequences are artifacts at the ends of sequence reads such as multiplex identifiers, adapters, and primer sequences that were introduced during pre-amplification with primer-based methods. The base frequencies across the reads present an easy way to check for tag sequences. If the distribution seems uneven (high frequencies for certain bases over several positions), it could indicate some residual tag sequences. This doesn’t indicate a problem as such - just that the sequences will need to be adapter trimmed before proceeding with any downstream analysis.</p>

<p>To investigate tag or adapter content, FastQC generates a plot showing a cumulative percentage count of the proportion of the library which has seen each of the adapter sequences at each position. Once a sequence has been seen in a read it is counted as being present right through to the end of the read so the percentages you see will only increase as the read length goes on.</p>

<h3 id="tag-sequences-k-mer-content">Tag sequences: K-mer content</h3>

<p><img src="../../images/kmer_content.png" alt="several peaks are visible on the log2 obs/exp graph of different k-mers at different positions in the read." /></p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span>
Another way to find tag sequences is to look at the K-mer content, and find those which do not have even coverage through the length of your reads and could correspond to tag sequences.</p>

<p>K-mers with positionally biased enrichment are reported. The top 6 most biased K-mer are additionally plotted to show their distribution.</p>

<p>Over-represented K-mers will appear as sharp spikes at a single point in the sequence, deviating from what should be a progressive or broad enrichment.</p>
