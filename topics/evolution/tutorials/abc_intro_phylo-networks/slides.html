#About these slides
<br>
<br>
The following phylogenetic networks of _Anolis_ species were generated in SplitsTree. They represent selected screenshots of networks explored as a live demo in the video associated with these slides.

#Uncorrected P model
<br>
Phylogenetic network of _Anolis_ species created in SplitsTree using the uncorrected P model. 
![Circular phylogenetic network with many branches splitting outwards from a central point to multiple Anolis species at the periphery. The network is oriented so that the species Diplolaemus darwinii and Phenacosaurus acutirostrus appear on the right hand side.](images/06-networks-uncorrectedP.png)

#Exploring splits
<br>
Click on the branches of the network to explore different splits. Here _A. ahli_ appears in two different splits highlighted in yellow.

#Let's follow a split
<br>
This is the network made using the uncorrected p model. We will follow the split containing _A. lineatopus_ and _A. limifrons_ through different models.

#Jukes Cantor Model
<br>
These networks were created using the Jukes Cantor model. Note that the species _A. limifrons_ appears in two alternate splits.

#HKY85 Model 
<br>
This network was created with the HKY85 model. Note that _A. limfrons_ is paired with _A. humilis_ in this split.

#Bootstrapped network - a closer look
<br>
Let's explore our two splits again

.pull-left[ ![Close up screen shot of a section of a circular phylogenetic network with multiple branches splitting out from a central point. The split containing A. humilis and A. limifrons is highlighted in yellow and is annotated with the value 99.99](images/06-networks-bootstrap-split1.jpg) ]

.pull-right[ ![Close up screen shot of a section of a circular phylogenetic network with multiple branches splitting out from a central point. The split containing A. lineatopus and A. limifrons is highlighted in yellow and is annotated with the value 38.3](images/06-networks-bootstrap-split2.jpg) ]

#Bootstrapped network - a closer look
<br>
This the centre of our bootstrapped network. Note that the values are smaller.
