# Likelihood

*A way to select models, given data*

---
# Why Likelihood?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* _Statistical rigour!_  Likelihood requires a statistical model and gains scientific rigour to defend hypotheses made.
* _Comparing hypotheses!_ We can compare models of evolution and determine which is better supported by the data.
* _Accuracy!_ Likelihood is generally the most accurate method to estimate phylogenies.



---
# Likelihood Definition
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The *likelihood* of a model is a quantity that is *proportional* to the probability that the model gave you the data.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It is easy(ish) to calculate the probability that a given model yields a particular outcome -- the data set.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Maximum Likelihood (ML) seeks to find the model for which this probability is the *highest*.


---
# Dice example
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Imagine I have a set of very strange 10-sided dice, where the sides of my .blue[blue] die are labelled (1,1,2,3,4,5,5,6,6,6), and the sides of the .red[red] die are labelled (1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,6).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Both dice have the same range of possible outcomes, 1 through 6, but the relative probabilities are different.

| score | P.red[red] | P.blue[blue]|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|	1 | 0.2 | 0.2 |
|		2 | 0.1 | 0.2 |
|		3 | 0.1 | 0.2 |
|		4 | 0.1 | 0.2 |
|		5 | 0.2 | 0.1 |
|		6 | 0.3 | 0.1 |
|	Total	| 1.0 | 1.0 |


---
# Dice example
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Suppose I choose a die and roll it three times, getting values 3, 6, and 2.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Which die is most likely to have been used?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If it were the .blue[blue] die then the probability of this outcome is \\(0.1\times 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.003\\).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If it were the .red[red] die then this probability is \\(0.2\times 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.004\\).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Neither of these probabilities is high!  But the larger of the two is for the .red[red] die: thus, given the data, we would say the maximum likelihood estimate of the &quot;model&quot; (here, which die was used) is the .red[red] die.


---
# Slightly formal, with Bayes
&lt;br&gt;
We could write this example more formally as

* Data \\(D\\) is the outcome \\((3,6,2)\\);

* \\(P(\color{blue}{B})\\) and \\(P(\color{red}{R})\\) are the probabilities of choosing the blue and red dice (say 0.5 each);

* \\(P(D|\color{blue}{B})\\) and \\(P(D|\color{red}{R})\\) are the probabilities of the data given the model &quot;blue die&quot; and &quot;red die&quot;;

* \\(P(\color{blue}{B}|D)\\) is the probability of the *model* given the *data*, and it can be written

\\(
	P(\color{blue}{B}|D) = \frac{P(D|\color{blue}{B})P(\color{blue}{B})}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D|\color{blue}{B})P(\color{blue}{B})}{P(D|\color{blue}{B})P(\color{blue}{B})+P(D|\color{red}{R})P(\color{red}{R})}
\\)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
-- this is *Bayes&apos; formula*.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* Similarly we can write \\(P(\color{red}{R}|D)\\) as

\\(
	P(\color{red}{R}|D) = \frac{P(D|\color{red}{R})P(\color{red}{R})}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D|\color{red}{R})P(\color{red}{R})}{P(D|\color{blue}{B})P(\color{blue}{B})+P(D|\color{red}{R})P(\color{red}{R})}
\\)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* These conditional probabilities can be thought of as the relative likelihoods of the model, given the data.


---
# Important Concepts learned
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The dice example was very simple but it showed us important concepts:

1. We could turn around the probability of the data given a model to the probability of a model, given the data;
&lt;br&gt;
2. Of the models considered, it was possible to choose one that was more likely;
&lt;br&gt;
3. These likelihoods can be really small, and don&apos;t have to sum to 1 (so they&apos;re not probabilities really).


---
# Likelihood values in practice
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In phylogenetics the probability of an alignment given a tree and its probabilities become really tiny so in order to avoid underflow numerical errors we use the natural log of the probabilities, and call it the *log-likelihood*.



---
# Probability of a substitution
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now suppose we have a probability matrix whose entries are the probabilities of nucleotide substitution in some fixed time, say 1 million years:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
.image-50[ ![Formula where the probability of nucleotide substitutions P is expressed in a matrix with the nucleotides AGCT on both the x and y axis. The probability of changing from any nucleotide to another is 0.01. Probability of not changing is 0.97. Long description provided in the video recording at 11:20.](images/05-mle-02-probmatrix-1.png) ]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We could then calculate the probability of going from one nucleotide to another, say *A* to *G*, in 1M years by reading it from the graph:

\\(
	Pr(A\to G) = P_{A,G} = 0.01.
\\)


---

# Probability of sequences changing
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To calculate the probability of multiple nucleotides changing we multiply the individual probabilities together -- which is making direct use of the assumption that each nucleotide site evolves independently of the others.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We would then calculate the probability of going from sequence **AAGT** to **AAGA** as

&lt;br&gt;

$$
\begin{align}
prob &amp; = P(A\to A)\times P(A\to G) \times P(G\to G) \times P(T\to A) \\\\
     &amp; = 0.97 \times 0.01 \times 0.97 \times 0.01 \\\\
     &amp; \approx 9.4\times 10^{-6}
\end{align}
$$

---
# Changing the time
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To calculate the probability of sequences changing in our toy example for say *two* million years, we would *square* the probability matrix \\(P\\):
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
.image-50[ ![Formula where the probability of sequences changing over two million years P2 is expressed in a matrix with the nucleotides AGCT on both the x and y axis. The probability of changing from any nucleotide to another is 0.0196. Probability of not changing is 0.9412.
Long description provided in the video recording at 13:12.](images/05-mle-03-probmatrixsquared-1.png)]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Notice that the probability of going from A to G is not quite twice what it was before, since now there is a small chance that A will change to G and then back again.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So if we have a probability matrix for a fixed time period we can convert it to a probability matrix for multiples of that time.

---
# Probabilities to Rates
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This doesn&apos;t generalise to arbitrary time periods, so instead we use a *rate* matrix, like this:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
.image-50[ ![Formula where the rate of nucleic acid subtitutions Q is expressed as a matrix with the nucleotides AGCT on both the x and y axis. The rate of change from any nucleotide to another is 0.01. The rate of not changing is -0.03. Long description provided in the video recording at 15:56](images/05-mle-04-ratematrix-1.png) ]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Converting a rate matrix to a probability requires a matrix *exponentiation*, giving formulae like this:

\\(
	P(t) = e^{Qt}.
\\)

We won&apos;t worry here about technical details, but note that some classes of rate matrix are easier to work with than others, the easiest being the JC69 (one parameter) matrix.


---
# Likelihood uses rate matrices
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* Many models of sequence evolution available, including different base (nucleotide) frequencies, and different sites being allowed different rates.

* Likelihoods will be expressed as a (negative) log-likelihood, and these are used to compare models.

* Typically these will be quite large (e.g., -37000, -80000), but it is the *relative likelihoods* that matter, so the *difference* between log likelihoods.


.blue[A model is selected to give the best chance of getting the phylogeny right.]

---
# A huge range of models
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* More parameter-rich models fit better; we need to avoid over-fitting.

* The (log)-likelihood value can be adjusted to penalise the model, based on the number of parameters.

* Common penalties are the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).

* There is also a &quot;corrected&quot; AIC (AICc), and a &quot;Bayesian Information Criterion&quot; penalty (BIC).

---
# Penalised likelihood
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For a model with \\(k\\) free parameters and a log likelihood \\(L\\), here are the penalty functions:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
AIC is the original information-theoretic correction:
\\( AIC = 2k-2\ln(L)\\)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
AICc is a correction for small sample sizes and is equal to
\\( AICc = AIC + \frac{2k^{2}+2k}{n-k-1} \\)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
BIC is defined by
\\( BIC = k\ln(n) - 2\ln(L)\\)
(where \\(n\\) is a measure of sample size).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
All of these are in common use but the commonest is AIC, and that is the method we use in the tutorial.

---
# Phylogenetic likelihood is mostly directionless
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The likelihood calculations in this tutorial are based on *reversible* models: that means that there is no difference between the likelihood of going from sequence A to sequence B of from B to A.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This means that the output trees are *unrooted*.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
(There are some asymmetric models included in IQTree but they are well beyond the scope of this tutorial and are not in common use.)

---
# Likelihood of a tree and model
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now we have the huge task:

```{code}
ML Search:
	for every tree $T$ in tree space {
		for each parameter in the substitution rate matrix {
			for each branch length {
				Calculate the (log-)likelihood of the alignment
			}
		}
	}
```

... and find the best combination!
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
All this means that *Maximum Likelihood is slow*.

# Likelihood under JC69
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
.image-50[ ![Formula where rate of nucleic acid substitutions  according to Jukes-Cantor 69 model QJC69  are expressed as a matrix with the nucleotides AGCT on both the x and y axis. The rate of change from any nucleotide to another is represented by the character alpha. The rate of not changing is represented by an asterisk. Long description provided in the video recording at 26:47](images/05-mle-05-JC69-1.png) ]

.reduce-75[ where the asterisk is a short-hand to make the row-sums equal 0. ]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* This model has only one parameter.
* Note: we cannot separate this from the overall rate (just as you can&apos;t tell people how &quot;far&quot; somewhere is by assuming how fast they&apos;ll travel).
* Thus tree search is &quot;only&quot; over all trees and all branch lengths.

* The HKY85 model has *four* parameters: \\(\pi\_{A}\\), \\(\pi\_{G}\\), \\(\pi\_{C}\\) (and this fixes \\(\pi\_{T}\\)), and a transition/ transversion rate ratio \\(\kappa\\).

* Can fix \\(\pi\\) or estimate it from the observed frequencies, or even estimate it by searching for the best values (which means it takes longer of course).

# GTR
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The General Time Reversible model has *nine* parameters: three from the base frequencies and six more from the parameters in the substitution rate matrix:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
.image-50[ ![Formula where rate of nucleic acid substitutions  according to the GTR model QGTR  is expressed as a matrix with the nucleotides AGCT on both the x and y axis.

&lt;br&gt;

(The Greek letters are not standardised: they just show the structure.)

# Rates across sites
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* Some sites are non-coding: they evolve *faster* than others.

* Third codon position sites are largely redundant: for most amino acids, the third nucleotide is *free to vary*.

* Some are under *strong selection* and evolve slowly.

* Some are so important that they must stay in the same state else a protein will not fold properly: these are *fixed*.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This means that even if the same rate matrix might be applicable at different sites, the overall substitution rate might be hundreds of times faster at one site than another.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Models that accommodate this are called &quot;Rates Across Sites&quot; or RAS models.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
.blue[By default, IQTree includes RAS models.]

![Schematic representing differences in the rate of substitutions at different sites. A line with two dots on it represents two positions within a gene. Blue arrows connect each dot to separate rate matrices. The matrices are identical but the matrix on the right is annotated 5x indicating that there are 5 times more substitutions at this site. Described at 33:00](images/05-mle-08-RAS-1.png)

While the proportions of substitution types might be the same, the overall *rate* at these two sites can differ.

# Tree perturbations 1: NNI

*N*earest *N*eighbour *I*nterchange is a way to transform one tree into another -- so we can search for the best tree.

An NNI move consists of effectively collapsing an internal branch of the tree and re-expanding it out in either of two possible ways.

For example, given the original tree

.image-25[ ![Schematic of an unrooted phylogenetic tree. There are three connected internal nodes x,y,z and five tips A, B, C, D, E. A and B are connected to x; C is connected to Y; E and D are connected to z.](images/05-mle-10-initialtree-1.png) ]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
there are two internal edges: \\(x-y\\) and \\(y-z\\). We can do an NNI move on each of them.

# Hill Climbing
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Tree Search algorithms work essentially by
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
1. Starting with a reasonably good estimate, e.g., using Neighbour-Joining;

2. Checking all the neighbouring trees under whichever perturbation is being used for an acceptable new tree;

3. If an acceptable new tree is available, move to it!  If not, then stop.
	- Most simply, &quot;acceptable&quot; means &quot;better than this one&quot;.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This kind of heuristic search is called *hill climbing*, from the obvious analogy.
