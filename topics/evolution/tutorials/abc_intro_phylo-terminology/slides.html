Presenter notes contain extra information which might be useful if you intend to use these slides for teaching.

Press `P` again to switch presenter notes off

Press `C` to create a new window where the same presentation will be displayed.
This window is linked to the main window. Changing slides on one will cause the
slide to change on the other.

Useful when presenting.

# Beginning with the leaves of the tree only

![Schematic of a phylogenetic tree composed of five extant taxa (white boxes) and their hypothetical ancestors (purple boxes). Coloured lines represent relationships between taxa. The root of the tree is a hypothetical common ancestor at the top of the image and extant taxa are at the bottom. The tree branches from this common ancestor twice on the left to form two clades containing extant taxa 1 and 2; or extant taxa 3. The tree branches once to the right to form a clade containing extant taxa 4 and 5.](images/02-rooted-tree.png)

![Schematic of a phylogenetic tree where internal nodes are represented by purple circles and extant taxa by white rectangles. Coloured lines represent the relationship between nodes and taxa. The root of the tree is at the top of the image and indicated by an arrow. The tree branches multiple times from this ancestor through additional ancestors forming three clades composed of five extant taxa at the bottom of the image.](images/03-this-is-the-root-only.png)

![Schematic of a phylogenetic tree where internal nodes are represented by purple circles and extant taxa by white rectangles. Coloured lines represent the relationship between nodes and taxa. An arrow and text box indicates that yellow lines are “Internal edges/branches show the relationships between all taxa”. The root of the tree is at the top of the image.

![Schematic of a phylogenetic tree where internal nodes are represented by purple circles and extant taxa by white rectangles. Coloured lines represent the relationship between nodes and taxa. An arrow and text box indicates that green lines connecting extant taxa to their nearest common ancestor are “Pendant edges/branches are always in every tree where the taxa differ so are not interesting”. The root of the tree is at the top of the image. The tree branches multiple times from this node through additional internal nodes forming three clades composed of five extant taxa at the bottom of the image.](images/06-pendant-branches-only.png)

The root of the tree is at the top of the image. The tree branches multiple times from this node through additional internal nodes forming three clades composed of five extant taxa at the bottom of the image. Red dotted lines are drawn alongside the branches that form a path between extant taxa 2 and 3, and the root and extant taxa 4. Boxed text and red arrows indicate that the dotted lines are “Evolutionary distance is path length”.](images/07-path-lengths-only.png)

A yellow dotted line circles a branch containing three extant taxa and two internal nodes on the left.

The root of the tree is at the top of the image and the tree branches into two clades as you move towards the bottom of the image. The clades are formed of hypothetical common ancestors and five extant taxa which are labelled as the ‘in group’. Two additional taxa are appended to the right hand side of the tree and are labelled as the outgroup.](images/11-rooted.png)
