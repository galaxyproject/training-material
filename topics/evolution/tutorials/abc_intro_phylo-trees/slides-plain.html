<h1 id="why-should-building-work-then">Why should building work then?</h1>
<p><br />
<br />
Some parts of a phylogeny can be confidently accepted: when there are two species much more similar to each other than they are to any other species, we can confidently say that they are likely to be each other’s closest relatives, in the set of species of interest.
<br />
<br />
If molecular sequences evolve at a nice steady rate - the “molecular clock” hypothesis - and if there’s neither too little nor too much change, this can be good enough.</p>

<hr />
<h1 id="distances-from-trees">Distances from trees</h1>
<p><br />
<br />
Before we talk about building a tree from distances, we need to think about how distances are reflected by trees.
<br />
<br />
The most natural way to infer distances from trees is by adding the lengths of branches between each pair of nodes.
<br />
<br />
Such distances are called <em>patristic</em> distances (I don’t know why).

<br />
Patristic distance between tips e and f is 0.02 + 0.015 + 0.02 + 0.01 + 0.02 = 0.085</p>

<hr />
<h1 id="tree-like-distances-are-easy">Tree-like distances are easy</h1>
<p><br />
<br />
A set of distances between the tips (taxa) that match the patristic distances of some tree is called <strong>tree-like</strong>.
<br />
<br />
Given tree-like distances, most tree construction methods will work.
<br />
<br />
Yes, <em>most</em> - not all!</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="clock-like">Clock-like</h1>
<p><br />
<br />
The easiest possible distance data to work with are those where the distance from the root to every tip is the same.
<br />
<br />
Such trees (and the distances derived from them) are called <em>ultrametric</em> (that is, they have the same root-to-tip distance for every tip).</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="clock-like-1">Clock-like</h1>
<p><br />
<br />
For example, suppose this is the <em>true</em> tree relating some species of interest, with actual branch lengths as labelled:

<ul>
  <li>We get distances from molecular sequences once they have been <em>aligned</em>.</li>
  <li>There are various ways to compare aligned sequences to obtain distances:
    <ul>
      <li>uncorrected “p-distance” – the proportion of sites that differ between the two sequences;</li>
      <li>the Jukes-Cantor (JC69) correction, which takes into account of multiple character state changes through time;</li>
      <li>The Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY85) model, which also allows for variation in nucleotide frequencies \(\pi_{A}, \pi_{C}, \pi_{G}, \pi_{T}\) as well as different transition/transversion rates;</li>
      <li>and more.</li>

This model has one single parameter, assuming that the base frequencies are each 25%: \(\pi_{A}=\pi_{G}=\pi_{C}=\pi_{T}=0.25\)
<br />
<br />
The rate matrix looks like this:
<br />
.image-40[ <img src="graphics/04-QJC69-1.png" alt="Rate matrix representing the Jukes Cantor model. The matrix has the nucleotides AGCT on both the x and y axis.

<br />
.reduce50[where the asterisk is a short-hand to make the row-sums equal 0.]
<br />
<br />
Under this model the expected number of substitutions between two sequences with a p-distance of \(p\) is
\(\hat{d} = \frac{-3}{4}\ln\left(1-\frac{4}{3}p\right)\)</p>

<br />

This model also allows for a correction to turn relative observed numbers of substitutions between the different bases into expected total number of substitutions between two sequences, but it is much more complex.</p>

Neighbo[u]r-Joining solves this problem by accounting for the <em>net divergence</em> of node from the rest, so if distances are tree-like, even if they’re not ultrametric, it <em>will</em> get the tree right.

<br />
The formula for net divergence, with <em>n</em> taxa (i.e., an <em>n</em> <em>x</em> <em>n</em> distance matrix) is
<br />
<br />
\(r\_{i} = \frac{1}{n-2}\sum\_{j\neq i}D(i,j)\)

<em>Losing tree-like distances</em>
—</p>
<ul>
  <li>Real data are not tree-like in general.</li>
  <li>We should adjust the final branch lengths that are found.</li>
  <li>One criterion is <em>Minimum Evolution</em>; this minimises the sum of squared differences (“ordinary least squares”; OLS) between the patristic distances, say <em>G</em>, from the tree and the original distances <em>D</em>:
<br />
\(OLS = \sum\_{i,j}(D(i,j) - G(i,j))^{2}\)
<br />
This assumes that the estimates are independent of each other, which clearly isn’t the case as the distances between tips in the tree often share parts of the paths between them.

<p><br />
<br /></p>
<ul>
  <li>A tree-building method will <em>always give you a tree</em>, even if the data didn’t come from one.</li>
  <li>There is no information on “next best” trees.</li>
  <li>There is no measure of “goodness” for the most part (though you could always quote the least squares error).</li>
  <li>Lastly, there is by default no going back on bad decisions: because NJ is a greedy heuristic, once the tree is finished, we <em>stop</em>. Luckily, we have programs like FastTree to do some adjustment!</li>
