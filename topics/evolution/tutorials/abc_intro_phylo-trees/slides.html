# Why _build_ trees?
&lt;br&gt;
The main reason we end up building a tree is that searching tree space for an optimal one takes too long when the number of taxa gets large.

# Why should building work then?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Some parts of a phylogeny can be confidently accepted: when there are two species much more similar to each other than they are to any other species, we can confidently say that they are likely to be each other&apos;s closest relatives, in the set of species of interest.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If molecular sequences evolve at a nice steady rate - the &quot;molecular clock&quot; hypothesis - and if there&apos;s neither too little nor too much change, this can be good enough.

# Distances from trees
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Before we talk about building a tree from distances, we need to think about how distances are reflected by trees.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The most natural way to infer distances from trees is by adding the lengths of branches between each pair of nodes.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Such distances are called *patristic* distances (I don&apos;t know why).

# Tree-like distances are easy
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A set of distances between the tips (taxa) that match the patristic distances of some tree is called **tree-like**.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Given tree-like distances, most tree construction methods will work.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Yes, _most_ - not all!

---

# Clock-like
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The easiest possible distance data to work with are those where the distance from the root to every tip is the same.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Such trees (and the distances derived from them) are called _ultrametric_ (that is, they have the same root-to-tip distance for every tip).

---

# Clock-like
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For example, suppose this is the _true_ tree relating some species of interest, with actual branch lengths as labelled:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
![Schematic of a phylogenetic tree containing internal nodes a, b, c. Nodes d, e, f, g and h form the tips.

* The maximum root-to-tip distance is called the _height_ of the tree.
* Here, the root-to-tip distances are all the same. A set of distances with this property is called _ultrametric_.
* If the distances represent evolutionary time accurately and all the tips are in the present, then we should expect this property.
* Reconstructing trees from ultrametric distances is _super easy_.

# The general approach
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
![Flow chart illustrating how sequence alignment data or dis/similarity measures are used to calculate and calculate phylogenetic distances. Colours and shapes are used to differentiate different sections of the flowchart, guiding the viewer through each step from left to right. The flowchart begins with Sequence Alignment or Dis/Similarity Measures. These are used to form a distance matrix (D) which is used to select two nodes (x and y) forming a new node z. The distance matrix is updated with the new node z until no further nodes can be formed. Described at 8:20 in the video recording.](graphics/TreeConstruction.drawio.png)

# Our distances
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* We get distances from molecular sequences once they have been _aligned_.
* There are various ways to compare aligned sequences to obtain distances:
	- uncorrected &quot;p-distance&quot; -- the proportion of sites that differ between the two sequences;
	- the Jukes-Cantor (JC69) correction, which takes into account of multiple character state changes through time;
	- The Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY85) model, which also allows for variation in nucleotide frequencies \\(\pi\_{A}, \pi\_{C}, \pi\_{G}, \pi\_{T}\\) as well as different transition/transversion rates;
	- and more.

---

# Jukes-Cantor / JC69
&lt;br&gt;
This model has one single parameter, assuming that the base frequencies are each 25%: \\(\pi\_{A}=\pi\_{G}=\pi\_{C}=\pi\_{T}=0.25\\)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The rate matrix looks like this:
&lt;br&gt;
.image-40[ ![Rate matrix representing the Jukes Cantor model. The matrix has the nucleotides AGCT on both the x and y axis. The substitution rates are identical and represented by the character alpha. Asterisks are used as shorthand for values that make the row sums equal 0.

&lt;br&gt;
.reduce50[where the asterisk is a short-hand to make the row-sums equal 0.]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Under this model the expected number of substitutions between two sequences with a p-distance of \\(p\\) is
$$\hat{d} = \frac{-3}{4}\ln\left(1-\frac{4}{3}p\right)$$

Once the alignment is complete, each pair of sequences is compared to give an estimated distance between them: this forms the distance matrix for tree building.

# Neighbo[u]r-Joining
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Neighbo[u]r-Joining solves this problem by accounting for the *net divergence* of node from the rest, so if distances are tree-like, even if they&apos;re not ultrametric, it *will* get the tree right.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The formula for net divergence, with *n* taxa (i.e., an *n* *x* *n* distance matrix) is
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$$r\_{i} = \frac{1}{n-2}\sum\_{j\neq i}D(i,j)$$
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And the adjusted distance becomes
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
$$D^{\ast}(i,j) = D(i,j) - r(i) - r(j)$$

---
# Adjusted distance matrix
&lt;br&gt;
Net divergences:
.center[
| $$i$$ | $$r(i)$$ |
|:---:|:------:|
|	d | 0.075666 |
|	e | 0.050666 |
|	f | 0.065666 |

#Realistic data
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
*Losing tree-like distances*
---
* Real data are not tree-like in general.
* We should adjust the final branch lengths that are found.
* One criterion is _Minimum Evolution_; this minimises the sum of squared differences (&quot;ordinary least squares&quot;; OLS) between the patristic distances, say _G_, from the tree and the original distances _D_:
&lt;br&gt;
$$OLS = \sum\_{i,j}(D(i,j) - G(i,j))^{2}$$
&lt;br&gt;
This assumes that the estimates are independent of each other, which clearly isn&apos;t the case as the distances between tips in the tree often share parts of the paths between them.

---
# Limitations
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* A tree-building method will _always give you a tree_, even if the data didn&apos;t come from one.
* There is no information on &quot;next best&quot; trees.
* There is no measure of &quot;goodness&quot; for the most part (though you could always quote the least squares error).
* Lastly, there is by default no going back on bad decisions: because NJ is a greedy heuristic, once the tree is finished, we _stop_. Luckily, we have programs like FastTree to do some adjustment!
