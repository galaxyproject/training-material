- Use Galaxy on the [Cloud](https://galaxyproject.org/cloud/)
- Get the SlipStream [Galaxy Appliance](https://bioteam.net/products/galaxy-appliance/)

## Reasons to install Galaxy in production

- [install](https://galaxyproject.org/admin/tools/add-tool-tutorial) and use tools unavailable on [public Galaxies](https://galaxyproject.org/public-galaxy-servers)
- use sensitive data (e.g. clinical)
- process large datasets that are too big for public Galaxies
- [plug-in](https://galaxyproject.org/admin/internals/data-sources) new datasources

---

### By default Galaxy
&lt;!-- - Uses SQLite
- Uses a built-in HTTP Server
- Runs all tools locally
