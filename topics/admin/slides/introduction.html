title: "Galaxy from an administrator point of view"
type: "introduction"
zenodo_link: ""
questions:
  - What options to deploy Galaxy do I have?
  - Which platforms are supported by Galaxy?
  - What requirements does Galaxy have?
objectives:
  - Learn about different options about Galaxy deployment.
  - Make an educated decision about your preferred deployment model.
time_estimation: "20m"
key_points:
  - Galaxy is scalable from personal computers to huge HPC and cloud-instances.
  - Amount of expected users and storage capabilities does have a big impact on the deployment.

# Where can Galaxy run?

* Cloud (SaaS)
  - [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org)
  - [Public Galaxy Servers](https://galaxyproject.org/use)
  - [Amazon EC2](https://galaxyproject.org/cloudman)
  - Semi-private cloud (e.g.: [Genomics Virtual Lab](https://www.gvl.org.au/), [Jetstream](http://jetstream-cloud.org/))
* Private cloud (build your own Galaxy SaaS)
* Cloud (IaaS)
  - Any cloud
* Scalable Local Server
  - Dedicated or shared compute cluster(s)
  - Cloud compute resources
* Standalone Local Server

## Reasons to Install Your Own Galaxy

- You want to run a local [production Galaxy](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/admin/production.html)
- You want to develop [Galaxy tools](https://galaxyproject.org/admin/tools/add-tool-tutorial)
- You want to [Develop Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/develop/) itself
- [Install](https://galaxyproject.org/admin/tools/add-tool-tutorial) and use tools unavailable on [public Galaxies](https://galaxyproject.org/public-galaxy-servers)
- Use sensitive data (e.g. clinical)
- Process large datasets that are too big for public Galaxies
- [plug-in](https://galaxyproject.org/admin/internals/data-sources) new datasources

# Software Requirements

Required:
  - Galaxy is written in Python and depends on **Python 3.5** or newer

Optional (but not really):
  - [PostgreSQL](https://galaxyproject.github.io/dagobah-training/2018-oslo/03-production-basics/databases.html)
  - [Reverse proxy server](https://galaxyproject.github.io/dagobah-training/2018-oslo/03-production-basics/webservers.html) (NGINX, Apache)

---

# Hardware Requirements

This depends:

- What do you intend to run?
- Where do you intend to run it?

If possible, run the Galaxy server **separate** from Galaxy jobs

**Storage** will be the bigger concern

---
# Server Hardware Requirements

Based on concurrent user count and assuming separate compute for jobs:

Users     | Resource estimate
----------|-------------------
1 - 5     | 1 core, 1GB, 10 TB
5 - 20    | 2 cores, 2 GB, 40 TB
20 - 40   | 8 cores, 8 GB, 200 TB
40+       | multiple hosts, 16 GB/host, 500 TB, dedicated DB host

Storage is the big variable since it, like compute, is **analysis** and **policy** dependent

# Galaxy Storage Philosophy

- Foster transparency and reproducibility
- Data is always created, *never overwritten*
- Copying history or library datasets associate them with the original file on disk without an actual copy
- By default, data is never really deleted unless *explicitly instructed*
- Even deleted data can be undeleted unless *forcibly purged*

---

# Storage Requirements

An "average" NGS analysis (by Anton Nekrutenko): **66 GB**

10 users, 10 histories: **> 6 TB**

Solutions:

- Quotas
- Set job limits in `job_conf.xml`
- Clean up deleted data (with a cron job)
- Forced removal based on age
- Users can configure their workflows to delete intermediate tool outputs
- Data libraries for common data
- Public servers: require email verification (and watch for duplicates)

---

# Compute Requirements

This depends:

- What tools will your users be using?
  - What are their requirements?
- In general, the most commonly used tools use a single core
  - But can use lots of memory!
- Some compute-intensive tools use multiple cores

usegalaxy.org allocates from **8 GB/core** to **16 GB/core**

Connecting Galaxy to clusters/HPC is covered in the advanced section.

# How is Galaxy deployed?

Current:

- Ansible / `git clone https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy.git`
- *Framework dependencies* provided as Python "wheels", fetched at first startup with `pip`
- *Tool dependencies* provided as Conda packages or legacy Tool Shed packages

Future:

- Galaxy wheel in PyPI

---
# Making Plans

**Before** deploying your first Galaxy server:

- Get PostgreSQL (you do not want to switch later)
- Figure out where Galaxy will be stored
  - Make sure it will be accessible to any eventual compute
- Figure out where data will be stored
  - Make sure it will be accessible to any eventual compute

---
# Deployment Best Practices

**Use configuration management**
- [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com) ([tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/ansible/slides.html))
- [Chef](https://www.chef.io/)
- [Puppet](https://puppet.com)
- [SaltStack](https://saltstack.com)
- [CFEngine](https://cfengine.com)

**Use configuration management** but if you don't, *record every change you make somehow.*
- Large, complex deployments grow organically
- If you don't know what you did you can't do it again
- "My context switching penalty is high and my process isolation is not what it used to be." - Elon Musk

# System Administration Best Practices

Take security seriously
- OS security best practices (not covered yet)
- **Update Galaxy when security updates are released**
  - We put a lot of effort into these!

Privilege separate if you can
- Separate code and job/data ownership

Write protect Galaxy and data if you can
- Read-only cluster mounts

Back up everything (except that which is managed by configuration management)
