<h1 id="cleanups">Cleanups</h1>

<p>There are two kinds of data that are produced when running a Galaxy: files users create and then delete or purge, and
then files Galaxy creates itself. Both of these can be cleaned to save space.</p>

<h2 id="user-created-files">User Created Files</h2>

<p>You can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gxadmin</code> to cleanup user created files. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gxadmin</code> is covered in more detail in <a href="/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/gxadmin/tutorial.html">its own dedicated

</ul>

<h1 id="backups">Backups</h1>

<p>There are a few important things to back up with your Ansible Galaxy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Galaxy
    <ul>
      <li>The Galaxy-managed config files</li>
      <li>The playbooks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Database</li>
  <li>The Data</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="galaxy">Galaxy</h2>

<p>By using Ansible, as long as you are storing your playbooks on another system, you are generally safe from failues of
the Galaxy node, and you’ll be able to re-run your playbook at a later date.</p>

<p>However, playbooks often do not include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which tools you’ve installed (have you ever installed a tool outside of ephemeris? This might be lost!)</li>
  <li>Conda environments, which will not always resolve identically over time. If strong guarantees of reproducibility are
important, then consider backing these up as well.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="database-backups">Database Backups</h2>

<p>We’re setting a couple of variables to control the automatic backups, they’ll be placed in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/data/backups</code> folder next to our user uploaded Galaxy data.</p>

<h2 id="data-backup">Data Backup</h2>

<p>With Galaxy it is <em>technically</em> only necessary to backup your inputs, as the downstream files <em>should</em>, <em>in theory</em> be re-createable due to the reproducibility of Galaxy.</p>

<p>In practice, some groups either choose to not backup, or to backup everything, often to extremely cheap and slow storage like Glacier or a tape library.</p>

<p>Most groups choose to implement this as a custom cron job, e.g.</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">post_tasks</span><span class="pi">:</span>

  <p>People who, let’s say, care strongly about backups will often insist that you need to version files. This is of course unnecessary in the Galaxy case as files are essentially Write Once Read Many (WORM)s, which is a really good file storage practice. Files can get removed so it isn’t a true <abbr title="Write Once Read Many">WORM</abbr> strategy that you’d use for e.g. audit logs, but it is close.
That said, since files never get changed, keeping multiple versions is unnecesary.</p>

  <p>Please consider communicating <strong>very well</strong> with your users what the data backup policy is.</p>
