title: "Reference Data with CVMFS"
objectives:
- Have an understanding of what CVMFS is and how it works
- Install and configure the CVMFS client on a linux machine and mount the Galaxy reference data repository
- Configure your Galaxy to use these reference genomes and indices
- Use an ansible playbook for all of the above.

# Built in Data

![List_of_data.png](../../images/i06-List_of_data.png)

???

- Many tools need reference data
- E.g. this BWA-MEM tool requires a reference genome
- But where do you get this data?
- And how do tools know where to find it?

---

# Data, what data?

.large[
* Some genomes are large! Human, Mouse, Coral
* Some tools require indices of the genomes.
* The indices take a long time to build!
* Better to pre-build the indices.
]

???

- Much of this reference data requires calculation to generate it
- For example, building dataset indexes
- It is better to build them beforehand, so Galaxy has a concept of reference data

# Data schematics in Galaxy

![schematic](../../images/data_managers_schematic_overview.png)

???

- Here is a more conrete example
- A reference dataset is required as input
- A tool (e.g. bwa) is used to build the index
- The outputs are registered with Galaxy's data registry in a loc file
- The tool data table xml file has a listing of all of the loc files
- When a user runs the BWA tool, Galaxy knows where to find this reference data

---

# Index Generation with Data Manager

- Allows for the **creation of built-in** (reference) data
	- underlying data
	- data tables
	- \*.loc files
- Specialized Galaxy tools that can only be accessed by an admin
- Defined **locally** or installed from **ToolShed**

???

- Data managers are special tools in Galaxy
- They create the reference data
- And update the loc files

---

# "loc" files - Short for location!

```text
#
#<unique_build_id>   <dbkey>   <display_name>   <file_path>
#
bosTau7 bosTau7 Cow (bosTau7)   /genomes/bosTau7/bwa_mem_index/bosTau7/bosTau7.fa

hg19    hg19    Human (hg19)    /genomes/hg19/bwa_mem_index/hg19/hg19.fa
hg38    hg38    Human (hg38)    /genomes/hg38/bwa_mem_index/hg38/hg38.fa
mm10    mm10    Mouse (mm10)    /genomes/mm10/bwa_mem_index/mm10/mm10.fa
```

???

- Here is an example loc file
- They list all of the indexes of a specific type
- Some of these indexes will be tool specific like this one, and some will be more general like a list of genomes
- This file is updated by the data manager.

---

# Where are the data tables?

(Usually located in `galaxy/config/tool_data_table_conf.xml`)

```xml
  <tables>
    <!-- Locations of indexes in the BWA mapper format -->
    <table name="bwa_mem_indexes" comment_char="#" allow_duplicate_entries="False">
      <columns>value, dbkey, name, path</columns>
      <file path="tool-data/bwa_index.loc" />
    </table>
  </tables>
```

???

- The tool data table conf file lists table names, and their associated loc file
- Additionally it defines the meaning of each column in the loc file

---

# Using reference data in a tool

#### bwa.xml

```xml
<param name="ref_file" type="select" label="Using reference genome" help="Select genome from the list">
  <options from_data_table="bwa_mem_indexes">
    <filter type="sort_by" column="2" />
    <validator type="no_options" message="No indexes are available" />
  </options>
  <validator type="no_options" message="A built-in reference genome is not available for the build associated with the selected input file"/>
</param>

```

???

- When a tool wants to use the data from those tables, it needs to declare which tables it wants to access (see previous slide)
- A select type parameter is created for the user's selections
- The tool knows that the options should come from a BWA-MEM indexes loc file
- These reference datasets are sorted by column 2, the name
- An some validators ensure a helpful message is shown if no data is available

---

# Some Problems!

- Super complex, right?
- Time consuming!
  - ~30 minutes work just to add a new genome to 1 tool!
- Administrator needs to know:
  - how to index **every** tool
  - expected format of the reference data
  - format of the .loc file
- Some parts solved by Data Managers
- **But there's an easier way!**

???

- This was a lot of information
- And very genomics specific in some places
- A lot of work to create and update the reference data
- But there is a better way!

---

# There's a lot of reference data

.large[
(and it's hard to keep up with)
]
![ref_data_prob_flow.png](../../images/ref_data_prob_flow.png)

???

- Imagine going through this process every time a user request comes in
- It would be unpleasant

# CernVM-FS to the rescue

- Needed a method of sharing reference data across country efficiently
- **CVMFS** is an efficient method for read only data sharing between systems
    - Originally designed for distributed software installation at Cern
    - Turns out it's really useful for read only data sets as well
    - HTTP-based, firewall friendly
- All nodes of Galaxy Main get their reference genomes and indices from CVMFS
    - Shared via mirroring and caching across the country
- It's also really useful to share data **globally**
    - The **usegalaxy.\*** initiative has taken full advantage of this.

???

- CVMFS and the IDC solves these issues
- CVMFS provides a global repository of reference data
- Originally built by CERN for sharing software, we use it for data
- It's an HTTP based protocol and very firewall friendly
- All of the usegalaxy.* servers host a CVMFS repository

---

# IDC

- Group of admins working on the CVMFS data repository
- Wish to automate the management of data and generation of new indicies
- Come join us: [github.com/galaxyproject/idc](https://github.com/galaxyproject/idc)

???

- The IDC is the other half of the puzzle
- CVMFS provides the storage, and the IDC provides the data
- Join us on github if you are interested

# CVMFS Global Structure

.widen_image[
![cvmfs_global_structure.png](../../images/cvmfs_global_structure.png)
]

???

- CVMFS has a hierarchical structure
- At the top is the stratum 0 server, the original copy of the datasets
- This is replicated to the read-only stratum 1 servers
- Anyone can connect to these stratum 1 servers
- And whenever connections fail, CVMFS will fail over to another mirror
- The mirror selection process is based on connection round trip times
- As a result, the nearest mirror is usually selected.

---

.widen_image[
![cvmfs_server_distribution.png](../../images/cvmfs_server_distribution.png)
]

???

- There are CVMFS servers across the entire world
- The primary mirrors are run by Galaxy project, Galaxy Europe, and Galaxy Australia
- If one of these mirrors fails, you will still be able to use the reference data
