title: "Reference Data with CVMFS"
objectives:
- Have an understanding of what CVMFS is and how it works
- Install and configure the CVMFS client on a linux machine and mount the Galaxy reference data repository
- Configure your Galaxy to use these reference genomes and indices
- Use an ansible playbook for all of the above.

# Built in Data

# Data, what data?

.large[
* Some genomes are large! Human, Mouse, Coral
* Some tools require indices of the genomes.
* The indices take a long time to build!
* Better to pre-build the indices.

# Using reference data in a tool

```xml

# Where are the data tables?

#### tool_data_table_conf.xml

(Usually located in `galaxy/config/`)

```xml
  <tables>
    <!-- Locations of indexes in the BWA mapper format -->
    <table name="bwa_mem_indexes" comment_char="#" allow_duplicate_entries="False">
      <columns>value, dbkey, name, path</columns>
      <file path="tool-data/bwa_index.loc" />
    </table>
  </tables>
```

# Some Problems!

.large[
* Time consuming!
  * ~30 minutes work just to add a new genome to 1 tool!

* Administrator needs to know:
  * how to index **every** tool
  * expected format of the reference data
  * format of the .loc file

* Some parts solved by Data Managers

* But there's an easier way!

# There's a lot of reference data

# CernVM-FS to the rescue

* Needed a method of sharing reference data across country efficiently
* **CVMFS** is an efficient method for read only data sharing between systems
    * Originally designed for distributed software installation at Cern
    * Turns out it's really useful for read only data sets as well
    * HTTP-based, firewall friendly
* All nodes of Galaxy Main get their reference genomes and indices from CVMFS
    * Shared via mirroring and caching across the country
* It's also really useful to share data **globally**
    * The **usegalaxy.*** initiative has taken full advantage of this.
