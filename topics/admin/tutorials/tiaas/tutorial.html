                <p>Galaxy is widely used for teaching. In order to facilitate instructors, the Galaxy Project has developed Training Infrastructure as a Service (TIaaS).
Workshop instructors can apply for <abbr title="Training Infrastructure as a Service">TIaaS</abbr>, and on the day of their workshop, their participants will be placed in a special group and use dedicated
resources, thus reducing queue times on the day of the training.</p>

<figure id="figure-1" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/tiaas/tiaas_intro.png" alt="TIaaS concept. " width="1917" height="1665" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/tiaas/tiaas_intro.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> With TIaaS, all of your users visit the same server. In the background, the scheduler recognises which users are training users, and directs their jobs to special resources. In the EU deployment of TIaaS jobs preferentially use private resources, but can spill over to the main queue if there is not enough space available.</figcaption></figure>

<p>This tutorial will go cover how to set up such a service on your own Galaxy server.</p>

        <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DELETE</code> privilege is limited in scope to one table: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">group_role_association</code>. This allows TIaaS to
disassociate training groups from roles in the Galaxy database after the training event date has passed, so that
users who participated in a training return to using normal (non-training) resources after the training ends.</p>

        <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">galaxyproject.tiaas2</code> role will create a <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/stable/cron/cron.8.en.html">cron</a> job
to perform this process every night at midnight. You can control when this runs (or disable it) using
<a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-tiaas2/blob/d5be2a064c49e010f67bfcea18e36812da23d7d8/defaults/main.yml#L20">the tiaas_disassociate_training_roles variable</a>.</p>

        <p>This is one of the few statements we’ve provided that presents difficulties when running the playbook completely from scratch on a blank machine. Setting postgresql roles is one of the first steps in our playbook, but the rules we’ve provided above depend on the Galaxy tables existing in that database. If those tables aren’t there, it will fail. If you do someday run this from scratch, you’ll find that you need to comment out those roles.</p>

<h1 id="job-configuration">Job Configuration</h1>

<p>While observability for teachers or trainers is already a huge benefit, one of the primary benefits of <abbr title="Training Infrastructure as a Service">TIaaS</abbr> is that your jobs get sent to dedicated compute resources, which won’t be used by anyone else, during the period of the training. We will send all of the training jobs to pulsar if you have completed that tutorial, or one of the slurm destinations from the job configuration training.</p>

<p>In order to achieve this, we first need some way to sort the jobs of the training users into these private queues, while letting the other jobs continue on. So let’s create a <em>traffic controller</em> to figure out where jobs belong.</p>
