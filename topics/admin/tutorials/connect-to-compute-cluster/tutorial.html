                <p>The tools that are added to Galaxy can have a wide variance in the compute resources that they require and work efficiently on.
To account for this, Galaxy’s job configuration needs to be tuned to run these tools properly. In addition, site-specific variables must
be taken into consideration when choosing where to run jobs and what parameters to run them with.</p>

  <p>If you’ve set up your Galaxy server using the <a href="/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/ansible-galaxy/tutorial.html">Galaxy Installation with Ansible</a> tutorial, you will have created a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">galaxyservers</code> group in your inventory file, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hosts</code>, and placed your variables in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">group_vars/galaxyservers.yml</code>. Although for the purposes of this tutorial, the Galaxy server and Slurm controller/node are one and the same, in a real world deployment they are very likely to be different hosts. We will continue to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">galaxyservers</code> group for simplicity, but in your own deployment you should consider creating some additional groups for Slurm controller(s), Slurm nodes, and Slurm clients.</p>

  <p>If you have a smaller server, do you still need a DRM? Yes! You should definitely run Slurm or a similar option. If you don’t, as soon as you restart Galaxy with local runners, any running jobs will be killed. Even with a handful of users, it is a good idea to keep 1-2 CPU cores/4GB RAM reserved for Galaxy.</p>

<p>Note that the above Slurm config options are only those that are useful for this training exercise. In production, you would want to use a more appropriate configuration specific to your cluster (and setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SlurmdParameters</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config_overrides</code> is not recommended).</p>

<p>Installed with Slurm is MUNGE (MUNGE Uid ‘N Gid Emporium…) which authenticates users between cluster hosts. You would normally need to ensure the same Munge key is distributed across all cluster hosts (in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/munge/munge.key</code>) - A great task for Ansible. However, the installation of the munge package has created a random key for you, and you will not need to distribute this since you’ll run jobs only on a single host.</p>

<p>You can now check that all of the daemons are running with the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">systemctl status munge slurmd slurmctld</code></p>

<p>Running the playbook, the Slurm configuration, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/slurm/slurm.conf</code> (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/slurm-llnl/slurm.conf</code> on Debian-based distributions) was created for you automatically. All of the variables were set by default. If you need to override the configuration yourself, Slurm provides <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/configurator.html">an online tool</a> which will help you configure it.</p>

<h2 id="using-slurm">Using Slurm</h2>

<p>You should now be able to see that your Slurm cluster is operational with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sinfo</code> command. This shows the state of nodes and partitions (synonymous with queues in other DRMs). The “node-oriented view” provided with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-N</code> flag is particularly useful:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>sinfo
<span class="go">PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
debug*       up   infinite      1   idle localhost
</span><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>sinfo <span class="nt">-Nel</span>
<span class="go">Fri Nov  4 16:51:24 2016
NODELIST   NODES PARTITION       STATE CPUS    S:C:T MEMORY TMP_DISK WEIGHT FEATURES REASON
localhost      1    debug*        idle    1    2:1:1      1        0      1   (null) none
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If your node state is not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">idle</code>, something has gone wrong. If your node state ends with an asterisk *, the Slurm controller is attempting to contact the Slurm execution daemon but has not yet been successful (the * next to the partition name is normal, it indicates the default partition).</p>

<p>We want to ensure that Slurm is actually able to run jobs. There are two ways this can be done:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">srun</code>: Run an interactive job (e.g. a shell, or a specific program with its stdin, stdout, and stderr all connected to your terminal.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sbatch</code>: Run a batch job, with stdin closed and stdout/stderr redirected to a file.</li>
</ul>

<p>Galaxy runs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sbatch</code> jobs but we can use both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">srun</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sbatch</code> to test:</p>

<p>Moving one level further up the stack, we find DRMAA Python. This is a Galaxy framework <em>conditional dependency</em>. Conditional dependencies are only installed if, during startup, a configuration option is set that requires that dependency. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">galaxyproject.galaxy</code> Ansible role will install these conditional dependencies, automatically.</p>

<h1 id="galaxy-and-slurm">Galaxy and Slurm</h1>

<p>At the top of the stack sits Galaxy. Galaxy must now be configured to use the cluster we’ve just set up. The DRMAA Python documentation (and Galaxy’s own documentation) instruct that you should set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$DRMAA_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable so that DRMAA Python can find <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libdrmaa.so</code> (aka slurm-drmaa). Because Galaxy runs under systemd, the environment that Galaxy starts under is controlled by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">environment</code> option in systemd service unit that the ansible role manages. The galaxy task should thus be updated to refer to the path to slurm-drmaa, which is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/lib/slurm-drmaa/lib/libdrmaa.so.1</code>:</p>

      <p>We need to configure the Slurm job runner. First, we instruct Galaxy’s job handlers to load the Slurm job runner plugin, and set the Slurm job submission parameters. A job runner plugin definition must have a unique name as its key, and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">load</code> attribute. Since we already have a good default destination that uses singularity, we will simply modify that to use the slurm runner. Galaxy will do the equivalent of submitting a job as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sbatch /path/to/job_script.sh</code>. <!-- Note that we also need to set a default destination now that more than one destination is defined. --> In a job environment, the key is a unique identifier for that environment and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runner</code> attribute must match the key of a defined runner plugin:</p>

<p>After the job has been purged from the active jobs database, a bit of information (but not as much as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scontrol</code> provides) can be retrieved from Slurm’s logs. However, it’s a good idea to set up Slurm’s accounting database to keep old job information in a queryable format.</p>

<h1 id="recording-job-metrics">Recording Job Metrics</h1>

<p>Job metrics record properties of the jobs that are executed, information that can help you plan for trainings or plan capacity for further expansions of your Galaxy server. These properties include details such as the number of slots (cores) assigned to a job, the amount of memory available, details about the node on which the job executed, environment variables that were set at execution time, and more.</p>

<p>Galaxy collects and records very few job metrics by default, enabling more metrics plugins is recommended for any cluster-enabled Galaxy deployment. The metrics are stored in the Galaxy database, which can be queried externally to generate reports and debug job problems.</p>

<p>Some work has been done to try to analyse job runtime metrics to optimise cluster allocation based on job inputs, and enhance job submission (<span class="citation"><a href="#Tyryshkina_2019">Tyryshkina <i>et al.</i> 2019</a></span>). More work will be done in this area.</p>

<blockquote class="comment">
  <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-note"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment: Note</div>

  <p>Job metrics are only visible to Galaxy <em>admin users</em>, unless you set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">expose_potentially_sensitive_job_metrics: true</code>, like UseGalaxy.eu does. EU’s intention with this is to empower users and make everything as transparent as possible.</p>

  <p>This is the only option controlling which metrics general users see. Admins see all metrics collected, and by default general users see none.
However most of the metrics exposed by this setting are quite safe (e.g. cgroups information on resource consumption, walltime, etc.)</p>

<p>There is not a good rule we can tell you, just choose what you think is useful or will be.

					<b>Disliked</b>: I have stuck in the part of editing templates/galaxy/config/job_conf.xml.j2 because some lines differ from the resulting file from previous session (namely singularity was set as default) and I had to compare the file showed in the video with the file I had. I took some time, but it worked at the end.  It seems not so complicated now, but it will be when connecting to a living cluster. What happens when I have SLURM already configured at the server? And MUNGE (this guy made some nodes crash here because of very large log files), do I need to configure it in the cluster? It was not clear.
