# Galaxy Job Configuration

- Configured in `config/job_conf.xml`
- XML format with macro support
- Major components:
  - **Plugins**: distributed resource manager (DRM) modules to load
  - **Handlers**: job handler processes managing the lifecycle of jobs
  - **Destinations**: where to send jobs, and what parameters to run those jobs with
  - **Tool** to destination/handler mappings
  - **Resource** selection mappings: give users job execution options on the tool form
  - **Limits**: job runtime limits, e.g. the max number of concurrent jobs

???

- The job_conf file is a very powerul galaxy configuration piece critical to smooth cluster operation.
- Written in XML it connects your server with the available cluster resources.
- You can configure it in myriad ways.
- Study the advanced sample provided with codebase once you get a basic understanding.
- There are several major components of the job conf file.
- Plugins, handlers, destinations, tools, resources, and limits.
- We'll go into detail on each of these in the tutorial.

# Why cluster?

Running jobs on the Galaxy server negatively impacts Galaxy UI performance

Even adding one other host helps

Can restart Galaxy without interrupting jobs

???

- Galaxy itself is not resource hungry, but the jobs often are.
- Offloading the jobs to different machines is a more sustainable and reliable setup.
- This can prevent user jobs from making Galaxy unresponsive.

---

# Plugins

Correspond to job runner plugins in [lib/galaxy/jobs/runners](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/tree/dev/lib/galaxy/jobs/runners)

.left[Plugins for:]
- local
- Slurm (DRMAA subclass)
- DRMAA: SGE, PBS Pro, LSF, Torque
- HTCondor
- Torque: Using the `pbs_python` library
- Pulsar: Galaxy's own remote job management system
- Command Line Interface (CLI) via SSH
- Kubernetes
- Go-Docker
- Chronos

???

- Galaxy supports plugins for various job runners covering most of the popular DRMs.
- The Galaxy community also maintains its own job management system called Pulsar.
- If the scheduler you use is missing, talk to us!

---

# Cluster library stack (DRMAA)

![Cluster library stack](../../images/cluster_lib_stack.png)

???

- The cluster library stack we use in this tutorial will use DRMAA.
- DRMAA is an interface that many distributed resource managers provide.
- Galaxy can use DRMAA to interact with these in an agnostic manner.
- However, there are more underlying technologies that you are going to depend on.
- You don't need to have an in-depth understanding to run cluster deployment correctly.

---

# Handlers

Define which Galaxy processes are job handlers

- `id` attribute should match the `--server-name` param value of a process
- Dedicated handlers can be reserved, e.g. for small, high throughput jobs
- The list of plugins that are loaded by a job handler can be limited using `<plugin>` subelements (e.g. when the DRMAA plugin needs to be loaded with different library paths)
- Not defined in `job_conf.xml` when using *job handler mules*
- Defines how jobs are assigned to individual processes (use `db-skip-locked` !)

???

- Handlers are the Galaxy processes which interact with the cluster.
- You can define dedicated handlers for different types of jobs, or to interact with different clusters.
- Additionally, handlers definition in the job configuration controls how jobs are assigned to individual processes.
- There are many options for the assignment process, all are discussed in the advanced sample job configuration.
- db-skip-locked is the best choice for most cases, it enables handlers to grab multiple jobs to work on at once.

---

# Destinations

Define *how* jobs should be run

- Which plugin? (Slurm, Condor, Pulsar, etc?)
- In a Docker container? Which one?
- **DRM params** (queue, cores, memory, walltime)?
- Environment (variables e.g. `$PATH`, source an env file, run a command)?

???

- The destination section of the job configuration file is a map that defines which jobs go where.
- Jobs from any destination, can be processed by any plugin.
- Every job will find a path through this configuration and eventually get dispatched to the matching runner.
- These destinations can specify things like environment variables or resource requirements.

---

# The default job configuration

.left[`config/job_conf.xml.sample_basic`:]
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<job_conf>
    <plugins>
        <plugin id="local" type="runner" load="galaxy.jobs.runners.local:LocalJobRunner" workers="4"/>
    </plugins>
    <destinations>
        <destination id="local" runner="local"/>
    </destinations>
</job_conf>
```

???

- This is the default job configuration.
- It uses a local runner with 4 workers, or processes to process jobs.
- As a result if you restart Galaxy, jobs will be lost.

---

# Job Config - Tags

Both destinations and handlers can be grouped by **tags**

- Allows random selection from multiple resources
- Allows concurrency limits at the destination group level

???

- Tags can be applied to both destinations and handlers.
- This permits selecting randomly amongst the handlers or destinations.
- Tags can help the load distribution.

---

# Job Environment

`<env>` tag in destinations: configure the job exec environment

| tag syntax | function |
| ---- | ---- |
| `<env id="NAME">VALUE</env>` | Set `$NAME` to `VALUE` |
| `<env file="/path/to/file" />` | Source shell file at `/path/to/file` |
| `<env exec="CMD" />` | Execute `CMD` |

Source and command execution will be handled on the remote destination, don't need to work on the Galaxy server

???

- You can specify environment variables on the destination.
- Galaxy will ensure these are executed in the same environment and ahead of the job.

---

# Limits

Available limits

- Walltime (if not available with your DRM)
- Output size (if *any* tool output grows larger than this limit)
- Concurrency: Number of "active" (queued or running) jobs

???

- Configuration of job limits is best acommplished using both the DRM provided limits and the ones from Galaxy.
- Walltime is best set in your DRM, while output size is only possible through Galaxy.
- We recommend you set these at the DRM level which is better equipped to terminate misbehaving jobs.
- The most important limit however is usually concurrency.

---

# Concurrency Limits

Available limits

- Number of active jobs per registered user
- Number of active jobs per unregistered user
- Number of active jobs per registered user in a specified destination or destination tag
- Number of total active jobs in a specified destination or destination tag

???

- Using concurrency limits lets you ensure quality of service for everyone.
- By limiting jobs per user, you can prevent a single user from overwhelming the server, and ensure everyone can run jobs.
- Additionally with concurrency limits you can balance your instance between internal and external users.

---

# Shared Filesystem

Most job plugins require a **shared filesystem** between the Galaxy server and compute.

The exception is **Pulsar**. More on this in *Using heterogeneous compute resources*

???

- Most DRMs require a shared filesystem to ensure datasets are available to the jobs.
- Galaxy's Pulsar does not, and can be used in situations where no shared filesystem is available.

---

# Shared Filesystem

Our simple example works because of two important principles:

1. Some things are located *at the same path* on Galaxy server and node(s)
  - Galaxy application (`/srv/galaxy/server`)
  - Tool dependencies
2. Some things *are the same* on Galaxy server and node(s)
  - Job working directory
  - Input and output datasets

The first can be worked around with symlinks or Pulsar embedded (later)

The second can be worked around with Pulsar REST/MQ (with a performance/throughput penalty)

???

- For the DRMs which require a shared filesystem there are additional requirements.
- First, Galaxy and the tool dependencies are at the same location on the head and compute nodes.
- Job directories must be in a shared location on both head and compute nodes.
- This is mentioned in more detail in the tutorial.

---

# Multiprocessing

Some tools can greatly improve performance by using multiple cores

Galaxy automatically sets `$GALAXY_SLOTS` to the CPU/core count you specify when submitting, for example, 4:
- Slurm: `sbatch --ntasks=4`
- SGE: `qsub -pe threads 4`
- Torque/PBS Pro: `qsub -l nodes=1:ppn=4`
- Condor: `request_cpus: 4`

Tool configs: Consume `\${GALAXY_SLOTS:-4}`

???

- For multiprocessing to be available both the tool and the Galaxy tool wrapper need to support it.
- You need to understand what tools are being run and set destinations for them with the appropriate specification.
- You'll need to check for presence of GALAXY_SLOTS in the tool wrappers and tool macros to see if the tool supports multiple threads.

---

# Memory requirements

For **Slurm only**, Galaxy will set `$GALAXY_MEMORY_MB` and `$GALAXY_MEMORY_MB_PER_SLOT` as integers.

**Other DRMs:** Please PR the [appropriate code](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/lib/galaxy/jobs/runners/util/job_script/MEMORY_STATEMENT.sh).

For Java tools, be sure to set `-Xmx`, e.g.:

```xml
<destination id="foo" ...>
    <env id="_JAVA_OPTIONS">-Xmx4096m</env>
</destination>
```

???

- Memory requirements can be set as well.
- For some tools, you'll need to additionally provide environment variables to specify memory limits.
- This is different per DRM.

---

# Run jobs as the "real" user

If your Galaxy users == System users:
- Submit jobs to cluster as the actual user
- Configurable callout scripts before/after job to change ownership
- Probably requires limited sudo for Galaxy user

See: [Cluster documentation](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Admin/Config/Performance/Cluster)

???

- If you galaxy users map to the system users you can have Galaxy run the jobs with the account of those users.
- This allows proper resource accounting, but comes at some additional configuration complexities.

---

## Job Config - Mapping Tools to Destinations

Problem: Tool A uses single core, Tool B uses multiple
- Both submit to the same cluster
- Need different submit parameters (`--ntasks=1` vs. `--ntasks=4` in Slurm)

???

- Mapping tools to destinations is the heart of the job configuration.
- This permits you to define which tools go to which destinations, and what resources they need.

---

## Job Config - Mapping Tools to Destinations

Solution:

```xml
    <destinations default="single">
        <destination id="single" runner="slurm" />
        <destination id="multi" runner="slurm">
            <param id="nativeSpecification">--ntasks=4</param>
        </destination>
    </destinations>
    <tools>
        <tool id="hisat2" destination="multi"/>
    </tools>
```

???

- Here is an example mapping the hisat2 tool to a definition named multi.
- The multi destination specifies that 4 cores should be allocated for each job, and uses the slurm plugin.

---

# The Dynamic Job Runner

For when basic tool-to-destination mapping isn't enough

???

- However this static mapping sometimes isn't sufficient.
- Here a dynamic mapping can be used instead.
- Galaxy has several different methods for accomplishing this.

---

## The Dynamic Job Runner

A special built-in job runner plugin

Map jobs to destinations on more than just tool IDs

.left[Two types:]
- Dynamic Tool Destinations
- Python function

See: [Dynamic Destination Mapping](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/jobs.html#dynamic-destination-mapping)

???

- There are two built in ways to do this: dynamic tool destinations, and custom Python functions.
- We will cover both of these in the tutorial.

---

## Dynamic Tool Destinations

.left[Configurable mappings without programming:]
- YAML format config file `tool_destinations.yml`
- Map based on tool ID plus:
  - Input dataset size(s)
  - Input dataset number of records
  - User
- Maps to static destinations defined in job config

???

- The Dynamic Tool Destinations are written as a yaml file.
- You can easily write rules based on file input sizes or number of inputs or user information.
- This can be used to determine memory and cpu allocations.

---

## Arbitrary Python Functions

.left[Programmable mappings:]
- Written as Python function in `lib/galaxy/jobs/rules/`
- Map based on:
  - Tool ID
  - User email or username
  - Inputs
  - Tool Parameters
  - Defined "helper" functions based on DB contents
  - Anything else discoverable
    - Cluster queue depth?
    - ...?
- Can dynamically modify destinations in job config (i.e. `sbatch` params)

???

- If Dynamic Tool Destinations are insufficiently flexible, then custom Python functions can be written.
- These can use any arbitrary information you want.
- They have full access to submitter information, job parameters, and any other resource you might want.
- They can dynamically modify destination parameters during runtime.
- If you need flexibility, these are what you want.
