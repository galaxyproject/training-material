title: "Connecting Galaxy to a compute cluster"
zenodo_link: ""
questions:
  - How to connect Galaxy to a compute cluster?
  - How can I configure job dependent resources, like cores, memory for my DRM?
objectives:
  - Be familiar with the basics of installing, configuring, and using Slurm
  - Understand all components of the Galaxy job running stack
  - Understand how the `job_conf.xml` file controls Galaxy's jobs subsystem
  - Have a strong understanding of Galaxy job destinations
  - Know how to map tools to job destinations
  - Be able to use the dynamic job runner to make arbitrary destination mappings
  - Understand the job resource selector config and dynamic rule creation
time_estimation: "2h"
key_points:
  - Galaxy supports a variety of different DRMs.
  - Tools/Jobs/Users etc can have their own resource.

# Why cluster?

Running jobs on the Galaxy server negatively impacts Galaxy UI performance

Even adding one other host helps

Can restart Galaxy without interrupting jobs

---
# Cluster options

- Slurm
- Condor
- Torque
- PBS Pro
- LSF
- SGE derivatives maybe?
- Any other [DRMAA](https://www.drmaa.org/)-supported DRM
- Kubernetes
- Go-Docker

# Shared Filesystem

Our simple example works because of two important principles:

1. Some things are located *at the same path* on Galaxy server and node(s)
  - Galaxy application (`/srv/galaxy/server`)
  - Tool dependencies
2. Some things *are the same* on Galaxy server and node(s)
  - Job working directory
  - Input and output datasets

The first can be worked around with symlinks or Pulsar embedded (later)

The second can be worked around with Pulsar REST/MQ (with a performance/throughput penalty)

---
# Non-shared Galaxy

If Galaxy server is at `/srv/galaxy/server`, nodes must find it there too. Solutions:
- Node-local Galaxy at same path
- Node-local Galaxy at different path w/ symlink at `/srv/galaxy/server`
- Network filesystem Galaxy w/ symlink (usegalaxy.org uses CVMFS)
  - Can be different network FS server from Galaxy datasets
- Use embedded Pulsar to rewrite paths before job submission

---
# One interesting hybrid solution

Galaxy server as network FS server for application

Other server as network FS for datasets, job dirs, dependencies

Benefits:
- Better UI performance when not running from NFS
- Job IO does not affect Galaxy UI

Drawbacks:
- Slower dataset IO on Galaxy server

---
# Multiprocessing

Some tools can greatly improve performance by using multiple cores

Galaxy automatically sets `$GALAXY_SLOTS` to the CPU/core count you specify when submitting, for example, 4:
- Slurm: `sbatch --ntasks=4`
- SGE: `qsub -pe threads 4`
- Torque/PBS Pro: `qsub -l nodes=1:ppn=4`
- LSF: ??

Tool configs: Consume `\${GALAXY_SLOTS:-4}`

---
# Memory requirements

For **Slurm only**, Galaxy will set `$GALAXY_MEMORY_MB` and `$GALAXY_MEMORY_MB_PER_SLOT` as integers.

**Other DRMs:** Please PR the [appropriate code](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/lib/galaxy/jobs/runners/util/job_script/MEMORY_STATEMENT.sh).

For Java tools, be sure to set `-Xmx`, e.g.:

```xml
<destination id="foo" ...>
    <env id="_JAVA_OPTIONS">-Xmx4096m</env>
</destination>
```

# Run jobs as the "real" user

If your Galaxy users == System users:
- Submit jobs to cluster as the actual user
- Configurable callout scripts before/after job to change ownership
- Probably requires limited sudo for Galaxy user

See: [Cluster documentation](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Admin/Config/Performance/Cluster)
