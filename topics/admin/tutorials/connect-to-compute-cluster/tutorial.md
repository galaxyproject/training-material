# Running Galaxy Jobs with Slurm

{% include snippets/warning_results_may_vary.md %}

The tools that are added to Galaxy can have a wide variance in the compute resources that they require and work efficiently on.
To account for this, Galaxy's job configuration needs to be tuned to run these tools properly. In addition, site-specific variables must
be taken into consideration when choosing where to run jobs and what parameters to run them with.

## Installing Slurm

> ### {% icon comment %} Ansible Best Practices
> If you've set up your Galaxy server using the [Galaxy Installation with Ansible]({% link topics/admin/tutorials/ansible-galaxy/tutorial.md %}) tutorial, you will have created a `galaxyservers` group in your inventory file, `hosts`, and placed your variables in `group_vars/galaxyservers.yml`. Although for the purposes of this tutorial, the Galaxy server and Slurm controller/node are one and the same, in a real world deployment they are very likely to be different hosts. We will continue to use the `galaxyservers` group for simplicity, but in your own deployment you should consider creating some additional groups for Slurm controller(s), Slurm nodes, and Slurm clients.

> ### {% icon tip %} Do you need a DRM?
> If you have a smaller server, do you still need a DRM? Yes! You should definitely run Slurm or a similar option. If you don't, as soon as you restart Galaxy with local runners, any running jobs will be killed. Even with a handful of users, it is a good idea to keep 1-2 CPU cores/4GB RAM reserved for Galaxy.

Note that the above Slurm config options are only those that are useful for this training exercise. In production, you would want to use a more appropriate configuration specific to your cluster (and setting `FastSchedule` to `2` is not recommended).

Installed with Slurm is MUNGE (MUNGE Uid 'N Gid Emporium...) which authenticates users between cluster hosts. You would normally need to ensure the same Munge key is distributed across all cluster hosts (in `/etc/munge/munge.key`) - A great task for Ansible. However, the installation of the munge package has created a random key for you, and you will not need to distribute this since you'll run jobs only on a single host.

You can now check that all of the daemons are running with the command `systemctl status munge slurmd slurmctld`

```console
$ sudo systemctl status munge slurmd slurmctld

```

Running the playbook, the Slurm configuration, `/etc/slurm/slurm.conf` (or `/etc/slurm-llnl/slurm.conf` on Debian-based distributions) was created for you automatically. All of the variables were set by default. If you need to override the configuration yourself, Slurm provides [an online tool](https://slurm.schedmd.com/configurator.html) which will help you configure it.

## Using Slurm

You should now be able to see that your Slurm cluster is operational with the `sinfo` command. This shows the state of nodes and partitions (synonymous with queues in other DRMs). The "node-oriented view" provided with the `-N` flag is particularly useful:

```console
$ sinfo
PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
debug*       up   infinite      1   idle localhost
$ sinfo -Nel
Fri Nov  4 16:51:24 2016
NODELIST   NODES PARTITION       STATE CPUS    S:C:T MEMORY TMP_DISK WEIGHT FEATURES REASON
localhost      1    debug*        idle    1    2:1:1      1        0      1   (null) none
```

If your node state is not `idle`, something has gone wrong. If your node state ends with an asterisk \*, the Slurm controller is attempting to contact the Slurm execution daemon but has not yet been successful (the \* next to the partition name is normal, it indicates the default partition).

We want to ensure that Slurm is actually able to run jobs. There are two ways this can be done:

- `srun`: Run an interactive job (e.g. a shell, or a specific program with its stdin, stdout, and stderr all connected to your terminal.
- `sbatch`: Run a batch job, with stdin closed and stdout/stderr redirected to a file.

Galaxy runs `sbatch` jobs but we can use both `srun` and `sbatch` to test:


> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Running commands with `srun`

>    > > ```
>    > {: .solution }
>    {: .question}
{: .hands_on}

Although it looks like this command ran as if I had not used `srun`, it was in fact routed through Slurm.

If you've made it this far, your Slurm installation is working!

## Slurm-DRMAA

Above Slurm in the stack is slurm-drmaa, a library that provides a translational interface from the Slurm API to the generalized DRMAA API in C.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Installing Slurm-DRMAA
>
> 1. Add a `post_task` to your playbook to install `slurm-drmaa1` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `slurm-drmaa` (RedHat/CentOS), and additionally include the `galaxyproject.repos` role
>
>    ```yaml
>    - hosts: galaxyservers
>      become: true
>      ...
>      roles:
>        - galaxyproject.repos
>        - galaxyproject.slurm
>        ...
>      post_tasks:
>        - name: Install slurm-drmaa
>          package:
>            name: slurm-drmaa1
>    ```
>
> 2. Run the playbook (`ansible-playbook galaxy.yml`)
>
{: .hands_on}

Moving one level further up the stack, we find DRMAA Python. This is a Galaxy framework *conditional dependency*. Conditional dependencies are only installed if, during startup, a configuration option is set that requires that dependency. The `galaxyproject.galaxy` Ansible role will install these conditional dependencies, automatically.

# Galaxy and Slurm

At the top of the stack sits Galaxy. Galaxy must now be configured to use the cluster we've just set up. The DRMAA Python documentation (and Galaxy's own documentation) instruct that you should set the `$DRMAA_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable so that DRMAA Python can find `libdrmaa.so` (aka slurm-drmaa). Because Galaxy runs under systemd, the environment that Galaxy starts under is controlled by the `environment` option in systemd service unit that the ansible role manages. The galaxy task should thus be updated to refer to the path to slurm-drmaa, which is `/usr/lib/slurm-drmaa/lib/libdrmaa.so.1`:


> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Making Galaxy aware of DRMAA
>
> 1. Open your group variables and add the environment variable:
>
>    ```yaml
>    galaxy_systemd_zergling_env: DRMAA_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib/slurm-drmaa/lib/libdrmaa.so.1"
>    ```
>
>    This environment variable will then be supplied to any web process (zerglings or mules).
>
> 2. We need to modify `job_conf.xml` to instruct Galaxy on how to use a more advanced job submission setup. We will begin with a basic job conf:
>
>    If the folder does not exist, create `templates/galaxy/config` next to your `galaxy.yml` playbook (`mkdir -p templates/galaxy/config/`).
>
>    Create `templates/galaxy/config/job_conf.xml.j2` with the following contents:
>
>    ```xml
>    <job_conf>
>        <plugins workers="4">
>            <plugin id="local" type="runner" load="galaxy.jobs.runners.local:LocalJobRunner"/>
>        </plugins>
>        <destinations>
>            <destination id="local" runner="local"/>
>        </destinations>
>    </job_conf>
>    ```
>
>    > ### {% icon comment %} Note
>    > Depending on the order in which you are completing this tutorial in relation to other tutorials, you may have already created the `job_conf.xml.j2` file, as well as defined `galaxy_config_templates` and set the `job_config_file` option in `galaxy_config` (step 4). If this is the case, be sure to **merge the changes in this section with your existing playbook**.
>    {: .comment}
>
>    > ### {% icon tip %} workers=4
>    > In the local runner, `workers="4"` means "number of jobs that can be running at one time". For every other job runner, it means the number of threads that are created to start/manage/finish jobs. E.g. if you are in a class and 50 people submit jobs, then there are four threads that can handle these jobs at once. But additional job handlers can be more useful as well.
>    {: .tip}
>
> 3. Next, we need to configure the Slurm job runner. First, we instruct Galaxy's job handlers to load the Slurm job runner plugin, and set the Slurm job submission parameters. A job runner plugin definition must have the `id`, `type`, and `load` attributes. Then we add a basic destination with no parameters, Galaxy will do the equivalent of submitting a job as `sbatch /path/to/job_script.sh`. Note that we also need to set a default destination now that more than one destination is defined. In a `<destination>` tag, the `id` attribute is a unique identifier for that destination and the `runner` attribute must match the `id` of a defined plugin:

## Running a Job

You should now be able to run a Galaxy job through Slurm. The simplest way to test is using the upload tool to upload some text.

Note a few useful bits in the output:
- `Persisting job destination (destination id: slurm)`: Galaxy has selected the `slurm` destination we defined
- `submitting file /srv/galaxy/server/database/jobs/000/2/galaxy_2.sh`: This is the path to the script that is submitted to Slurm as it would be with `sbatch`
- `(1) queued as 4`: Galaxy job id "1" is Slurm job id "4", this can also be seen with the `(1/4)` in other output lines.
- If `job <id> ended` is reached, the job should show as done in the UI

Slurm allows us to query the exit state of jobs for a time period of the value of Slurm's `MinJobAge` option, which defaults to 300 (seconds, == 5 minutes):

```console
$ scontrol show job 4

```

After the job has been purged from the active jobs database, a bit of information (but not as much as `scontrol` provides) can be retrieved from Slurm's logs. However, it's a good idea to set up Slurm's accounting database to keep old job information in a queryable format.

# Galaxy and Slurm - Statically Mapping a Job

We don't want to overload our training VMs trying to run real tools, so to demonstrate how to map a multicore tool to a multicore destination, we'll create a fake tool.

## Writing a testing tool

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Deploying a Tool
>
> 1. Create the directory `files/galaxy/tools/` if it doesn't exist and edit a new file in `files/galaxy/tools/testing.xml` with the following contents:
>
>    ```xml
>    <tool id="testing" name="Testing Tool">
>        <command>
>            <![CDATA[echo "Running with '\${GALAXY_SLOTS:-1}' threads" > "$output1"]]>
>        </command>
>        <inputs>
>            <param name="input1" type="data" format="txt" label="Input Dataset"/>
>        </inputs>
>        <outputs>
>            <data name="output1" format="txt" />
>        </outputs>
>    </tool>
>    ```
>    {: .question}
>
> 2. Add the tool to the Galaxy group variables under the new item `galaxy_local_tools` :
>
>    ```yaml
>    galaxy_local_tools:
>    - testing.xml
>    ```
>
> 3. Run the Galaxy playbook.
>
> 4. Reload Galaxy in your browser and the new tool should now appear in the tool panel. If you have not already created a dataset in your history, upload a random text dataset. Once you have a dataset, click the tool's name in the tool panel, then click Execute.

{: .hands_on}

Of course, this tool doesn't actually *use* the allocated number of cores. In a real tool, you would call the tools's underlying command with whatever flag that tool provides to control the number of threads or processes it starts, such as `samtools sort -@ \${GALAXY_SLOTS:-1}`.

## Running with more resources

We want our tool to run with more than one core. To do this, we need to instruct Slurm to allocate more cores for this job. This is done in the job configuration file.


> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Allocating more resources
>
> 1. Edit your `templates/galaxy/config/job_conf.xml.j2` and add the following destination:

>                <param id="nativeSpecification">--nodes=1 --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=2</param>
>            </destination>
>    ```
> 2. Then, map the new tool to the new destination using the tool ID (`<tool id="testing">`) and destination id (`<destination id="slurm-2c">`) by adding a new section to the job config, `<tools>`, below the destinations:
>
>    ```xml
>        <tools>
>            <tool id="testing" destination="slurm-2c"/>
>        </tools>
>    ```
>
> 3. Run the Galaxy playbook. Because we modified `job_conf.xml`, Galaxy will be restarted to reread its config files.
>
> 4. Click the rerun button on the last history item, or click **Testing Tool** in the tool panel, and then click the tool's Execute button.

# Dynamic Job Destinations

Dynamic destinations allow you to write custom python code to dispatch jobs based on whatever rules you like. For example, UseGalaxy.eu at one point used a very complex custom dispatching configuration to handle sorting jobs between multiple clusters. Galaxy has [extensive documentation](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/admin/jobs.html#dynamic-destination-mapping-python-method) on how to write these sort of destinations.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Writing a dynamic job destination
>
> 1. Create and open `files/galaxy/dynamic_job_rules/my_rules.py`
>
>    ```python
>    from galaxy.jobs import JobDestination
>    from galaxy.jobs.mapper import JobMappingException
>    import os
>
>    def admin_only(app, user_email):
>        # Only allow the tool to be executed if the user is an admin
>        admin_users = app.config.get( "admin_users", "" ).split( "," )
>        if user_email not in admin_users:
>            raise JobMappingException("Unauthorized.")
>        return JobDestination(runner="slurm")
>    ```
>
>    This destination will check that the `user_email` is in the set of `admin_users` from your config file.
>
>    > ### {% icon tip %} Debugging dynamic destinations

>
> 4. Finally, in `job_conf.xml`, update the `<tool>` definition and point it to this destination:
>
>    ```xml
>        <tools>
>            <tool id="testing" destination="dynamic_admin_only" />

{: .hands_on}


Try running the tool as both an admin user and a non-admin user, non-admins should not be able to run it. You can start a private browsing session to test as a non-admin, anonymous user. Anonymous users were enabled in your Galaxy configuration.

![Unauthorized](../../images/unauthorized.png)

You can imagine extending this to [complex logic for permissions](https://galaxyproject.org/admin/config/access-control/), or for destination mapping depending on numerous factors. We did not cover it, but in the documentation you can add additional variables to your function signature, and they will be automatically supplied. Some useful variables are `tool`, `user`, `job`, and `app` if you need to load configuration information, and more [can be found in the documentation](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/jobs.html#dynamic-destination-mapping-python-method).

# Dynamically map a tool to a job destination

If you don't want to write dynamic destinations yourself, Dynamic Tool Destinations (DTDs) utilize the dynamic job runner to provide dynamic job mapping functionality without having to explicitly write code to perform the mapping. The mapping functionality is mostly limited to input sizes, but often input size is the most important factor in deciding what resources to allocate for a job.

## Writing a Dynamic Tool Destination

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Writing a DTD
>
> 1. Dynamic tool destinations are configured via a YAML file. As before, we'll use a fake example but this is extremely useful in real-life scenarios. Create the file `files/galaxy/config/tool_destinations.yml` with the following contents:
>
>    ```yaml
>    ---
>    tools:
>      testing:
>        rules:
>          - rule_type: file_size
>            lower_bound: 16
>            upper_bound: Infinity
>            destination: slurm-2c
>        default_destination: slurm
>    default_destination: local
>    verbose: True
>    ```
>
>    The rule says:
>    - If the tool has ID `testing`:
>      - If the input dataset is >=16 bytes, run on the destination `slurm-2c`
>      - If the input dataset is <16 bytes, run on the destination `slurm`
>    - Else, run on the destination `local`
>
> 2. We also need to inform Galaxy of the path to the file we've just created, which is done using the `tool_destinations_config_file` in `galaxy_config` > `galaxy`. Additionally we need to add a `galaxy_config_files` entry to ensure it is deployed.
>
>    ```yml
>    galaxy_config:
>      galaxy:
>        tool_destinations_config_file: {% raw %}"{{ galaxy_config_dir }}/tool_destinations.yml"{% endraw %}
>    ...
>    galaxy_config_files:
>      ...
>      - src: files/galaxy/config/tool_destinations.yml
>        dest: {% raw %}"{{ galaxy_config.galaxy.tool_destinations_config_file }}"{% endraw %}
>    ```
>
> 3. We need to update Galaxy's job configuration to use this rule. Open `files/galaxy/config/job_conf.xml` and add a DTD destination:
>
>    ```xml
>            <destination id="dtd" runner="dynamic">
>                <param id="type">dtd</param>
>            </destination>
>    ```
>
>    Also, comment out the previous `<tool>` definition for the `testing` tool, and replace it with a mapping to the dtd destination like so:
>
>    ```xml
>        <tools>
>        <!--
>            <tool id="testing" destination="slurm-2c"/>
>            <tool id="testing" destination="dynamic_admin_only" />
>        -->
>            <tool id="testing" destination="dtd"/>
>        </tools>
>    ```
>
> 4. Run the Galaxy playbook.
>
{: .hands_on}

## Testing the DTD

Our rule specified that any invocation of the `testing` tool with an input dataset with size <16 bytes would run on the 1 core destination, whereas any with >= 16 bytes would run on the 2 core destination.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Testing the DTD
>
> 1. Create a dataset using the upload paste tool with a few (<16) characters
>
> 2. Create a dataset using the upload paste tool with >16 characters

> 3. Run the `Testing Tool` on both datasets.

{: .hands_on}

You can imagine using this to run large blast jobs on compute hardware with more resources, or giving them more CPU cores. Some tools require more memory as job inputs increase, you can use this to run tools with a larger memory limit, if you know it will need it to process a certain size of inputs.

# Job Resource Selectors

You may find that certain tools can benefit from having form elements added to them to allow for controlling certain job parameters, so that users can select based on their own knowledge. For example, a user might know that a particular set of parameters and inputs to a certain tool needs a larger memory allocation than the standard amount for a given tool. This of course assumes that your users are well behaved enough not to choose the maximum whenever available, although such concerns can be mitigated somewhat by the use of concurrency limits on larger memory destinations.

Such form elements can be added to tools without modifying each tool's configuration file through the use of the **job resource parameters configuration file**

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Configuring a Resource Selector
>
> 1. Create and open `templates/galaxy/config/job_resource_params_conf.xml.j2`
>
>    ```xml
>    <parameters>
>        <param label="Cores" name="cores" type="select" help="Number of cores to run job on.">
>            <option value="1">1 (default)</option>
>            <option value="2">2</option>
>        </param>
>      <param label="Time" name="time" type="integer" size="3" min="1" max="24" value="1" help="Maximum job time in hours, 'walltime' value (1-24). Leave blank to use default value." />
>    </parameters>
>    ```
>
>    This defines two resource fields, a select box where users can choose between 1 and 2 cores, and a text entry field where users can input an integer value from 1-24 to set the walltime for a job.
>
> 2. As usual, we need to instruct Galaxy of where to find this file:

>          dest: {% raw %}"{{ galaxy_config.galaxy.job_resource_params_file }}"{% endraw %}
>      ```
>
> 3. Next, we define a new section in `job_conf.xml`: `<resources>`. This groups together parameters that should appear together on a tool form. Add the following section to your `templates/galaxy/config/job_conf.xml.j2`:
>
>    ```xml
>        <resources>
>            <group id="testing">cores,time</group>
>        </resources>
>    ```
>
>    The group ID will be used to map a tool to job resource parameters, and the text value of the `<group>` tag is a comma-separated list of `name`s from `job_resource_params_conf.xml` to include on the form of any tool that is mapped to the defined `<group>`.
>
>
> 4. Finally, in `job_conf.xml`, move the previous `<tool>` definition for the `testing` tool into the comment and define a new `<tool>` that defines the `resources` for the tool:
>
>    ```xml
>        <tools>
>            <!--
>            <tool id="testing" destination="slurm-2c"/>
>            <tool id="testing" destination="dtd"/>
>            -->
>            <tool id="testing" destination="dynamic_cores_time" resources="testing"/>
>        </tools>
>    ```
> 5. We have assigned the `testing` tool to a new destination: `dynamic_cores_time`, but this destination does not exist. We need to create it. Add the following destination in your job conf:
>
>    ```xml
>            <destination id="dynamic_cores_time" runner="dynamic">
>                <param id="type">python</param>
>                <param id="function">dynamic_cores_time</param>
>            </destination>
>    ```
>
>    This will be another dynamic destination. Galaxy will load all python files in the {% raw %}`{{ galaxy_dynamic_rule_dir }}`{% endraw %}, and all functions defined in those will be available `dynamic_cores_time` to be used in the `job_conf.xml`
>
{: .hands_on}

This will set everything up to use the function. We have:

- A set of "job resources" defined which will let the user select the number of cores and walltime.
- A job configuration which says:
    -  that our testing tool should allow selection of the cores and time parameters
    - directs it to use a new, `dynamic_cores_time` destination
    - and a has a new destination, `dynamic_cores_time`, which is defined as a dynamic destination which will call a python function we will load.

This is a lot but we're still missing the last piece for it to work:

## A dynamic destination

Lastly, we need to write the rule that will read the value of the job resource parameter form fields and decide how to submit the job.

- [Dynamic destination documentation](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/admin/jobs.html)
- Job resource parameters are not as well documented as they could be, but the [sample configuration file](https://github.com/galaxyproject/usegalaxy-playbook/blob/master/env/test/files/galaxy/config/job_resource_params_conf.xml) shows some of the possibilities.
- [usegalaxy.org's job_conf.xml](https://github.com/galaxyproject/usegalaxy-playbook/blob/master/env/main/templates/galaxy/config/job_conf.xml.j2) is publicly available for reference.
