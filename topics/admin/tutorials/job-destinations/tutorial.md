title: "Mapping Jobs to Destinations using TPV"
questions:
  - How can I configure job dependent resources, like cores, memory for my DRM?
  - How can I map jobs to resources and destinations
objectives:
  - Know how to map tools to job destinations
  - Be able to use the dynamic job runner to make arbitrary destination mappings
  - Understand the job resource selector config and dynamic rule creation
  - The various ways in which tools can be mapped to destinations, both statically and dynamically
  - How to write a dynamic tool destination (DTD)
  - How to write a dynamic python function destination
  - How to use the job resource parameter selection feature
time_estimation: "2h"
key_points:
  - Dynamic Tool Destinations are a convenient way to map
  - Job resource parameters can allow you to give your users control over job resource requirements, if they are knowledgeable about the tools and compute resources available to them.

This tutorial heavily builds on the [Connecting Galaxy to a compute cluster]({% link topics/admin/tutorials/connect-to-compute-cluster/tutorial.md %}) and it's expected you have completed this tutorial first.

Now that you have a working scheduler, we will start configuring which jobs are sent to which destinations.

# Mapping jobs to destinations

In order to run jobs in Galaxy, you need to assign them to a resource manager that can handle the task. This involves specifying the appropriate amount of memory and CPU cores. For production installations, the jobs
must be routed to a resource manager like SLURM, HTCondor, or Pulsar. Some tools may need specific resources such as GPUs or multi-core machines to work efficiently.

Sometimes, your available resources are spread out across multiple locations and resource managers. In such cases, you need a way to route your jobs to the appropriate location. Galaxy offers several methods for
routing jobs, ranging from simple static mappings to custom Python functions via [dynamic job destinations](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/admin/jobs.html#dynamic-destination-mapping).

Recently, the Galaxy project has introduced a library named [{TPV}](https://total-perspective-vortex.readthedocs.io/) to simplify this process. {TPV} provides a admin-friendly YAML configuration that works for most scenarios.
For more complex cases, TPV also allows you to embed Python code into the configuration YAML file and implement fine-grained control over jobs. 

Lastly, TPV offers a shared global database of default resource requirements (more below). By leveraging this database, admins don't have to figure out the requirements for each tool
separately.

## Writing a testing tool

To demonstrate a real-life scenario and {TPV}'s role in it, let's plan on setting up a configuration where the VM designated for training jobs doesn't run real jobs and hence doesn't get overloaded. To start, we'll create a "testing" tool that we'll use in our configuration. This testing tool can run quickly, and without overloading our small machines.

Of course, this tool doesn't actually *use* the allocated number of cores. In a real tool, you would call the tools's underlying command with whatever flag that tool provides to control the number of threads or processes it starts, such as `samtools sort -@ \${GALAXY_SLOTS:-1}`.

## Safeguard: TPV Linting

If we want to change something in production, it is always a good idea to have a safeguard in place. In our case, we would like to check the {TPV} configuration files for syntax errors, so nothing will break when we deploy broken yaml files or change them quickly on the server. TPV-lint-and-copy works with two separate locations:
- one where you can safely edit your files
- and the actual production config directory that galaxy reads.

Once you are done with your changes, you can run the script and it will automatically lint and copy over the files, if they are correct *and* mentioned in your job_conf.yml file, or in your `group_vars/galaxyservers.yml` inline `job_conf`.
And of course, Galaxy has an Ansible Role for that.

## Configuring TPV

We want our tool to run with more than one core. To do this, we need to instruct Slurm to allocate more cores for this job. First however, we need to configure Galaxy to use TPV.

# Configuring the TPV shared database

The Galaxy Project maintains a [shared database of TPV rules](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tpv-shared-database) so that admins do not have to independently rediscover ideal resource allocations for specific tools. These rules are based
on settings that have worked well in the usegalaxy.* federation. The rule file can simply be imported directly, with local overrides applied on top.

# Basic access controls

You may wish to apply some basic restrictions on which users are allowed to run specific tools. {TPV} accomodates user and role specific rules. In addition, TPV supports tagging of tools, users, roles and destinations. These tags
can be matched up so that only desired combinations are compatible with each other. While these mechanisms are detailed in the TPV documentation, we will choose a different problem that highlights some other capabilities
- restricting a tool so that only an admin can execute that tool.

# Job Resource Selectors

Certain tools can benefit from allowing users to select appropriate job resource parameters, instead of having admins decide resource allocations beforehand. For example, a user might know that a particular set of parameters and inputs to a certain tool needs a larger memory allocation than the standard amount given to that tool.
Galaxy provides functionality to have extra form elements in the tool execution form to specify these additional job resource parameters.
This of course assumes that your users are well behaved enough not to choose the maximum whenever available, although such concerns can be mitigated somewhat by the use of concurrency limits on larger memory destinations.

Such form elements can be added to tools without modifying each tool's configuration file through the use of the **job resource parameters configuration file**

This will set everything up to use the function. We have:

- A set of "job resources" defined which will let the user select the number of cores and walltime.
- A job configuration which says:
    - that our testing tool should allow selection of the cores and time parameters
    - directs it to TPV's `tpv_dispatcher` destination

This is a lot but we're still missing the last piece for it to work:

## Configuring TPV to process resource parameters

Lastly, we need to write a rule in TPV that will read the value of the job resource parameter form fields and decide how to submit the job.

The cores parameter can be verified from the output of the tool. The walltime can be verified with `scontrol`:

# More on TPV

The goal of this tutorial is to provide a quick overview of some of the basic capabilities of TPV. However, there are numerous features that we have not convered such as:
a. Custom code blocks - execute arbitrary python code blocks, access additional context variables etc.
a. User and Role Handling - Add scheduling constraints based on the user's email or role
b. Metascheduling support - Perform advanced querying and filtering prior to choosing an appropriate destination
c. Job resubmissions - Resubmit a job if it fails for some reason
d. Linting, formatting and dry-run - Automatically format tpv rule files, catch potential syntax errors and perform a dry-run to check where a tool would get scheduled.

These features are covered in detail in the [TPV documentation](https://total-perspective-vortex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Further Reading

- The [sample dynamic tool destination config file](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/config/tool_destinations.yml.sample) fully describes the configuration language
- [Dynamic destination documentation](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/admin/jobs.html)
- Job resource parameters are not as well documented as they could be, but the [sample configuration file](https://github.com/galaxyproject/usegalaxy-playbook/blob/master/env/test/files/galaxy/config/job_resource_params_conf.xml) shows some of the possibilities.
- [usegalaxy.org's job_conf.yml](https://github.com/galaxyproject/usegalaxy-playbook/blob/master/env/common/templates/galaxy/config/job_conf.yml.j2) is publicly available for reference.
- [usegalaxy.eu's job_conf.xml](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/search?l=YAML&q=galaxy_jobconf) is likewise (see the `group_vars/galaxy.yml` result)
