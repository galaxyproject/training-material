# Users, Groups, Quotas

## Overview

This section will cover handling of users, groups and quotas for Galaxy. We will look at the following in particular:
* User Activation and Control
* User Passwords and Session Policies
* Setting Admin users and admin control of users
* User Privacy
* Roles and Groups
* Setting permissions on Libraries and Datasets
* Quotas
* Introduction to alternate authentication

## User Activation

Require verification that a user's email is real. You must enable SMTP first.

In `galaxy.ini`:
* `user_activation_on` require users to click link in email before running jobs.
* `activation_grace_period` time (hours) that a user can 'explore' Galaxy before activation lockout.
* `inactivity_box_content` message provided to non-activated users.
* Disposable domain blacklist
  * `blacklist_file` defines domains in XXX.YYY format that will be rejected as user emails.


Exercise:
   - Enable User activation
   - Register a new user (second email / email+1@domail.tld)
   - Upload a Dataset

## User Control

In `galaxy.ini`:
* `require_login` can be enabled to prevent anonymous access.
* `show_welcome_with_login` show welcome page next to login page
* `allow_user_creation` allow user registration. When False, admins must create users; often coupled with `require_login`.
* `allow_user_dataset_purge` users can purge (permanently delete) their datasets.
* `api_allow_run_as` list of email addresses of API users who can make calls on behalf of other users.
* `expose_dataset_path` users to see the full path of datasets via the "View Details" option in the history.

## Password & Session Policies

In `galaxy.ini`:
* `password_expiration_period` days before requiring a user to change password.
* `session_duration` minutes before invaliding a user's session, requiring re-login.

---

class: left
## Admin Control

In `galaxy.ini`:
* `admin_users` comma-separated list of admin users' emails
* `allow_user_deletion` admins can delete users
* `allow_user_impersonation` admins can become other users. Great for debugging / user assistance.
* `master_api_key` admin super-key allows many API admin actions without having a real admin user.

Exercise:
 - Enable user impersonation
 - Log in as admin and become other user
 - View existing and create Histories and Datasets.

---

class: left
## User Privacy

In `galaxy.ini`:
* `expose_user_name` users can view other registered usernames
* `expose_user_email` users can view other registered emails
* `new_user_dataset_access_role_default_private` newly created datasets are private to the creating user

---

## Roles and Groups

#### Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Admin** can:
* create roles (each user automatically has their own 'private' role)
* create groups
* assign roles to groups
* assign users to groups
* assign groups to roles
* assign users to roles
* assign permission sets to roles
* assign permission sets to groups

---

## Dataset Roles


.left-column50[
**manage permissions**
* Users who have associated role on a dataset can manage the roles associated it.

**access**
* Users having associated role can use/view/download a dataset for analysis. Users must have every role associated with a dataset in order to access it
]

]]]

## Library Roles


.left-column50[
* **modify library item**: Users having associated role can modify this library item
* **access library**: Restrict access to this library to only users having associated role
* **add library item**: Users having associated role can add library items to this library item
* **manage library permissions**: Users having associated role can manage roles associated with permissions on this library item
]

]]

class: left
## Role Demo

* We will now demonstrate creation of Groups and Roles.
* We will show how restricting access to a Dataset prevents usage or download.

class: left
## Quotas

Used to control user disk usage.

To turn on the use of quotas: In `galaxy.ini`:
* `enable_quotas` Enable enforcement of quotas.  Quotas can be set from the Admin interface (under Data).
* must create quotas in admin interface before any quota will be enforced, otherwise 'unlimited'

Amounts:
 - Examples: "10000MB", "99 gb", "0.2T", "unlimited"
 - = / + / -

Default for user class:
 - None (No)
 - Unregistered Users
 - Registered Users

or associated with Groups or Users

---
class: left
## Exercise: Creating Quotas

* Create quotas for Unregistered (1b) and Registered Users (1mb)
* Create a quota that adds 1GB
* Create a quota that decreases by 1GB
* Create a quota that grants unlimited

## Alternate Authentication

* Galaxy-specific login using e-mail address and password
* OpenID authentication with Galaxy as a relying party
* HTTP remote user provided by any front-end Web server

More on this topic in Advanced Session 4: External authentication

---
class: left
## OpenID

* `enable_openid` Enable authentication via OpenID.
* `openid_config_file` = config/openid_conf.xml.sample used if default does not exist
* `openid_consumer_cache_path` where to cache OpenID files

Exercise: Enable OpenID:
* `enable_openid = True`
* Log in using GenomeSpace
* Log out
* Log in using GenomeSpace
* Send files to GenomeSpace
* Retrieve files from GenomeSpace
