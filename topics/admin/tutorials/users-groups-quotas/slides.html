# Users, Groups, and Quotas

???

Users, Groups, and Quotas

---

## Overview

This section will cover handling of users, groups and quotas for Galaxy. We will look at the following in particular:
* User Activation and Control
* User Passwords and Session Policies
* Setting Admin users and admin control of users
* User Privacy
* Roles and Groups
* Setting permissions on Libraries and Datasets
* Quotas
* Introduction to alternate authentication

???

- There are a large number of topics related to users, groups and quotas
- As an admin you have lots of control over this
- Most of the configuration lives in the galaxy.yaml file
- Some of the configuration must be done in the UI

---
## User Control

option | description
---- | ----
`require_login` | Prevent anonymous access.
`show_welcome_with_login` | Show welcome page next to login page.
`allow_user_creation` | Allow user registration. When False, admins must create users; often coupled with `require_login`.
`allow_user_dataset_purge` | Users can purge (permanently delete) their datasets.
`api_allow_run_as` | List of email addresses of API users who can make calls on behalf of other users.
`expose_dataset_path` | Users to see the full path of datasets via the &quot;View Details&quot; option in the history.

.footnote[.center[options in `galaxy.yml`]]

???

- These options let you control user login.
- For example, are anonymous users permitted?
- Are users able to register themselves?
- Are users able to purge datasets themselves?
- All of these are questions you will need to consider.

---

## User Activation

Require verification that a user's email is real. You must enable SMTP first.

option | description
---- | ----
`user_activation_on` | Require users to click link in email before running jobs.
`activation_grace_period` | Time (hours) that a user can 'explore' Galaxy before activation lockout.
`inactivity_box_content` | Message provided to non-activated users.
`email_domain_blocklist_file` | Defines domains in XXX.YYY format that will be rejected as user emails.

.footnote[.center[options in `galaxy.yml`]]

???

- Whenever a user registers, user activation settings control how this process happens
- If you want to require activation they cannot run tools until they receive the confirmation email
- If you want to prevent users registering from specific domains

---
## Password &amp; Session Policies

option | description
---- | ----
`password_expiration_period` | Days before requiring a user to change password. ([NIST recommends not requiring password changes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_policy#NIST_guidelines))
`session_duration` | Minutes before invaliding a user's session, requiring re-login.

.footnote[.center[options in `galaxy.yml`]]

???

- Some options are related to IT security policies
- Check with your local IT authority for best practices for your organisation

---

## Admin Control

option | description
---- | ----
`admin_users` | Comma-separated list of admin users' emails.
`allow_user_deletion` | Admins can delete users.
`allow_user_impersonation` | Admins can become other users. Great for debugging / user assistance.
`master_api_key` | Admin super-key allows many API admin actions without having a real admin user.

.footnote[.center[options in `galaxy.yml`]]

???

- In the ansible galaxy training, you set the admin_users variable to define an admin email
- User impersonation is a very commonly used feature
- It allows admins to debug issues in their users' histories
- A master api key cannot be used for every task an admin API key can be used for
- This is because it is not tied to an individual user

---

## User Privacy

option | description
---- | ----
`expose_user_name` | Users can view other registered usernames.
`expose_user_email` | Users can view other registered emails.
`new_user_dataset_access_role_default_private` | Newly created datasets are private to the creating user.

.footnote[.center[options in `galaxy.yml`]]

???

- These options control if the username or email are shown as a dropdown in the sharing menus
- The option &quot;new user dataset access role default private&quot; is important
- By default when users share by link, all datasets are public
- When you set this option, datasets are private, even though the history is shared via link
- Users will complain when it doesn't work, and have to be educated to click the appropriate buttons

---

## Roles and Groups

#### Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Admin** can:
* create roles (each user automatically has their own 'private' role)
* create groups
* assign roles to groups
* assign users to groups
* assign groups to roles
* assign users to roles
* assign permission sets to roles
* assign permission sets to groups

???

- Galaxy uses RBAC for permissions in many places
- Roles can be created, and assigned permissions
- Roles and groups behave similarly, grouping users together and granting permisisons

---

## Dataset Roles


.left-column50[
**manage permissions**
* Users who have associated role on a dataset can manage the roles associated it.

**access**
* Users having associated role can use/view/download a dataset for analysis. Users must have every role associated with a dataset in order to access it

**new_user_dataset_access_role_default_private** (`galaxy.yml`)
* When this is set, datasets are private by default.
]

.right-column50[.middle[.image-90[
![User_roles](../../images/dataset_roles.png)
]]]

???

- The manage permission controls which accounts can manage permissions of datasets
- Access permission is those who can see and work with the data
- These can be controlled in the permissions menu of datasets
- Or more generally at the history level
- Users must have every role listed in order to access that dataset
- This leads to the odd case where users wish to share with multiple groups
- But by adding more roles, it becomes unavailable to everyone

---

## Library Roles


.left-column50[
* **access library**: Restrict access to this library to only users having associated role
* **manage library permissions**: Users having associated role can manage roles associated with permissions on this library item
* **add library item**: Users having associated role can add library items to this library item
* **modify library item**: Users having associated role can modify this library item
]
.left-column50[.image-90[
![Library_roles](../../images/Library_roles.png)
]]

???

- Access library permits users with any of the listed roles to access the library
- No roles means a public library
- Generally the last three are set to the same values, unless you have complicated requirements
- In the library management, someone with any subset of the roles listed may make changes
- This is very different from dataset permission management, where users must have every role

---
## Quotas

Used to control user disk usage.

option | description
---- | ----
`enable_quotas` | Enable enforcement of quotas.  Quotas can be set from the Admin interface (under Data).

Must create quotas in admin interface before any quota will be enforced, otherwise 'unlimited'

Amounts:
 - Examples: &quot;10000MB&quot;, &quot;99 gb&quot;, &quot;0.2T&quot;, &quot;unlimited&quot;
 - = / + / -

Default for user class:
 - None (No)
 - Unregistered Users
 - Registered Users

or associated with Groups or Users

.footnote[.center[options in `galaxy.yml`]]

???

- You can enable quotas in your galaxy.yml file
- When the user has more data than their quotum permits, they are prevented from starting new jobs.
- many sites setup a &quot;quote increase request&quot; form, to let users request increases for specific, temporary projects

---
class: left
## Quota Details

- Quotas can be set for Users, or all users of a Group
- But it is not a &quot;group quota&quot;
- The quota is applied to individual users

Storage

- Quotas are stored in the DB tables `galaxy_user`, `galaxy_group`, and `quota`

???

- Quotas can be set for Users or Groups
- But it is applied individually, as users may receive multiple quota changes
- E.g. a user working for two groups, might receive two different quota increases

---
## Quota Automation

- There is currently no quota automation.
- Some individuals have written their own quota automation but it is quite ugly ([usegalaxy-eu/quota-sync](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/quota-sync))
- Could be nicer with a lot of work
- Quotas are like group/user management: not managed by files, only within UI/API

???

- Quotas can be managed through the API
- Some people want to automate this process, but it needs more work.




---
### &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-key&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;keypoints&lt;/span&gt; Key points


- Galaxy has a powerful user and group managment system that can be utilized for Quota management.
