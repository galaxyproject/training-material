# Overview
{:.no_toc}

Pulsar is the Galaxy Project's remote job running system. It was written by John Chilton (@jmchilton) of the Galaxy Project. It is a python server application that can accept jobs from a Galaxy server, submit them to a local resource and then send the results back to the originating Galaxy server.

More details on Pulsar can be found at:

- [Pulsar's Documentation](https://pulsar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- [Pulsar's Github Repository](https://github.com/galaxyproject/pulsar)
- [Pulsar Ansible Role](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-pulsar)


Transport of data, tool information and other metadata can be configured as a web application via a RESTful interface or using a message passing system such as RabbitMQ.

At the Galaxy end, it is configured within the `job_conf.xml` file and uses one of two special Galaxy job runners.
* `galaxy.jobs.runners.pulsar:PulsarRESTJobRunner` for the RESTful interface
* `galaxy.jobs.runners.pulsar:PulsarMQJobRunner` for the message passing interface.

In this tutorial, we will:

* Install and configure a Pulsar server on a remote linux machine using ansible
    * We will configure the Pulsar server to run via the RESTful interface
* Configure our Galaxy servers to run a job there
* Run a job remotely

This tutorial assumes that you have:

- A VM or machine where you will install Pulsar, and a directory in which the installation will be done. This tutorial assumes it is `/mnt`

# Installing the Pulsar Role

We need to create a new ansible playbook to install Pulsar. We will be using a *role* written by Nate Coraor - `galaxyproject.pulsar`

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Install the `galaxyproject.pulsar` ansible role
>
> 1. From your ansible working directory, edit the `requirements.yml` file and add the following line:
>
>    ```yaml
>    - src: https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-pulsar
>      name: galaxyproject.pulsar
>    ```
>
> 2. Now install it with:
>
>    ```bash
>    ansible-galaxy install -p roles -r requirements.yml
>    ```

# Configuring Pulsar

From the [`galaxyproject.pulsar` ansible role documentation](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-pulsar#role-variables), we need to specify some variables.

There is one required variable:

`pulsar_server_dir` - The location in which to install pulsar

Then there are a lot of optional variables. They are listed here for information. We will set some for this tutorial but not all.

 Variable Name                  | Description                                                                                        | Default
---------------                 | -------------                                                                                      | ---
 `pulsar_pip_install`           | Set to `true` to get pulsar to be sourced from pip.                                                | `false`
 `pulsar_yaml_config`           | a YAML dictionary whose contents will be used to create Pulsar's `app.yml`                         |
 `pulsar_git_repo`              | Upstream git repository from which Pulsar should be cloned.                                        | https://github.com/galaxyproject/pulsar
 `pulsar_changeset_id`          | A changeset id, tag, branch, or other valid git identifier for which version of Pulsar to load     | `master`
 `pulsar_venv_dir`              | The role will create a virtualenv from which Pulsar will run                                       | `<pulsar_server_dir>/venv` if installing via pip, `<pulsar_server_dir>/.venv` if not.
 `pulsar_config_dir`            | Directory that will be used for Pulsar configuration files.                                        | `<pulsar_server_dir>/config` if installing via pip, `<pulsar_server_dir>` if not
 `pulsar_optional_dependencies` | List of optional dependency modules to install, depending on which features you are enabling.      | `None`
 `pulsar_install_environments`  | Installing dependencies may require setting certain environment variables to compile successfully. |


Additional options from Pulsar's server.ini are configurable via the following variables (these options are explained in the Pulsar documentation and server.ini.sample):

Variable               | Description                                                                                                                                                              | Default
----------             | -------------                                                                                                                                                            | ------
`pulsar_host`          | This is the interface pulsar will listen to, we will set it to `0.0.0.0`                                                                                                 | localhost
`pulsar_port`          |                                                                                                                                                                          | 8913
`pulsar_uwsgi_socket`  | If unset, uWSGI will be configured to listen for HTTP requests on pulsar_host port pulsar_port; If set, uWSGI will listen for uWSGI protocol connections on this socket. | `unset`
`pulsar_uwsgi_options` | Hash (dictionary) of additional uWSGI options to place in the [uwsgi] section of server.ini                                                                              | `{}`


Some of the other options we will be using are:

* We are going to run in RESTful mode so we will need to specify a `private_token` variable so we can "secure" the connection. (For a given value of "secure".)
* We will be using the uwsgi web server to host the RESTful interface.
* We will set the tool dependencies to rely on **conda** for tool installs.

We will now write a new playbook for the pulsar installation similar to the one we did for the CVMFS installation earlier in the week.

We need to include a couple of pre-tasks to install python-virtualenv, python-pip and git etc.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Creating the playbook

>    {% endraw %}
>
>    There are a couple of *pre-tasks* here. This is because we need to install some base packages on these very vanilla ubuntu instances as well as give ourselves ownership of the directory we are installing into.

We also need to create the dependency resolver file so pulsar knows how to find and install dependencies for the tools we ask it to run. The simplest method which covers 99% of the use cases is to use conda auto installs similar to how Galaxy works. We need to create the file and put it where the `galaxyproject.pulsar` role can find it.


> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Creating dependency resolver configuration
>
> 1. Create a `templates` directory in your working directory.

>    <dependency_resolvers>
>        <conda auto_install="True" auto_init="True"/>
>    </dependency_resolvers>
>    ```
>
>    This tells pulsar to **only** look for dependencies in conda.

> ### {% icon tip %} Tip: Running non-conda tools

{: .tip}


> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Run the Playbook
>
> 1. Run the playbook. If your remote pulsar machine uses a different key, you may need to supply the `ansible-playbook` command with the private key for the connection using the `--private_key key.pem` option.
>
>    ```bash
>    ansible-playbook -i hosts pulsar_playbook.yml
>    ```
>
>    After the script has run, pulsar will be installed on the remote machines!
>
> 2. Log in to the machines and have a look in the `/mnt/pulsar` directory. You will see the venv and config directories. All the config files created can be perused.
>
{: .hands_on}

Pulsar can now be started. We do that by first activating the virtualenv, then running it and telling it which webserver to use (Paster) and where the config files are.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Starting Pulsar
>
> 1. Login to your Pulsar server
>
> 2. Change directory into `/mnt/pulsar`
>
> 3. Activate the virtualenv (`source venv/bin/activate`)
>
> 4. Run pulsar (`pulsar -m paster -c config/`)
>
{: .hands_on}


A log will now start scrolling, showing the startup of pulsar. You'll notice that it will be initializing and installing conda. Once it is complete and listening on the assigned port, you can stop the server with Ctrl-C.


> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Daemonizing
>
> 1. This is a pretty gross way of running Pulsar and it can run in daemon mode. To do that, add `--daemon` to the end of the above command line.
>
> 2. Stopping the daemon is as simple as re-running the command with `--stop-daemon` instead.
>
> 3. Before proceeding, make sure your Pulsar is running in `--daemon` mode.

# Configuring Galaxy

Now we have a Pulsar server up and running, we need to tell our Galaxy about it.

Galaxy talks to the Pulsar server via it's `job_conf.xml` file. We need to let Galaxy know about Pulsar there and make sure Galaxy has loaded the requisite job runner, and has a destination set up.

There are three things we need to do here:

* We will need to create a job runner which uses the  `galaxy.jobs.runners.pulsar:PulsarRESTJobRunner` code.
* Create job destination which references the above job runner.
* Tell Galaxy which tools to send to the job destination.

(We will use bwa-mem)

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Configure Galaxy
>
> 1. In your `job_conf.xml` file add the following job runner to the `<plugins>` section:
>
>    ```xml
>    <plugin id="pulsar_runner" type="runner" load="galaxy.jobs.runners.pulsar:PulsarRESTJobRunner" />
>    ```
>
>    Then add the Pulsar destination. We will need the ip address of your pulsar server and the private_token string you used when you created it.
>
>    Add the following to the `<destinations>` section of your `job_conf.xml` file:
>
>    ```xml
>    <destination id="pulsar" runner="pulsar_runner" >
>        <param id="url">http://your_ip_address_here:8913/</param>
>        <param id="private_token">your_private_token_here</param>
>    </destination>
>    ```
>
> 2. Finally we need to tell Galaxy which tools to send to Pulsar. We will tell it to send bwa-mem jobs to it. We use the `<tools>` section of the `job_conf.xml` file.
>    We need to know the full id of the tool in question, we can get this out of the `integrated_tool_panel.xml` file in the `mutable-config` directory. Then we tell Galaxy which destination to send it to (pulsar).
>
>    Add the following to the end of the `job_conf.xml` file (inside the `<tools>` section if it exists or create it if it doesn't.)
>
>    ```xml
>    <tools>
>        <tool id="toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/bwa/bwa_mem/0.7.17.1" destination="pulsar"/>
>    </tools>
>    ```
>
> 3. Restart Galaxy
>
{: .hands_on}


# Testing Pulsar

Now we will upload a small set of data to run bwa-mem with.


> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Testing the Pulsar destinatoin
>
> 1. Upload the following files from zenodo.
>
>    | File URL                                                 | filetype    |
>    | ----------                                               | ----------  |
>    | `https://zenodo.org/record/582600/files/mutant_R1.fastq` | fastqsanger |
>    | `https://zenodo.org/record/582600/files/mutant_R2.fastq` | fastqsanger |
>    | `https://zenodo.org/record/582600/files/wildtype.fna`    | fasta       |
>
> 2. Now run the bwa-mem tool with the `wildtype.fna` file as the reference, and the two fastq files as the paired end reads. Leave everything default.
>
>    As soon as you press *execute* Galaxy will send the job to the pulsar server. You can watch the log in Galaxy using:
>
>    ```
>    sudo supervisorctl tail -f galaxy stderr
>    ```
>
>    You can watch the log in Pulsar by ssh'ing to it and tailing the log file with:
>
>    ```
>    tail -f /mnt/pulsar/paster.log
>    ```
>
{: .hands_on}

You'll notice that the Pulsar server has received the job (all the way in Sydney!) and now should be installing bwa-mem via conda. Once this is complete (which may take a while - first time only) the job will run and the results will be returned to Galaxy!

How awesome is that? :)
