### Preparing Admin Training VMs

If you&apos;re falling along on Galaxy Admin Training VMs, you will need to setup Docker.

You can modify your Ansible setup to configure this as described at [bit.ly/gxadmin-docker-playbook](http://bit.ly/gxadmin-docker-playbook).

You will also need to stop Galaxy running on the VM so that you can run Galaxy in a container.

```
sudo supervisorctl stop galaxy
```

???

TODO: Remove this slide after the training, it isn&apos;t general.

---


### Preparation

```
$ docker pull bgruening/galaxy-stable:18.05
$ git clone https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable.git
```

???

Here you will learn the internals of the Docker Galaxy Image.
We will show you tips and tricks on how to run the Galaxy Docker
Image successfully in production, how to manage updates and how
to bind the container to a cluster scheduler. Moreover,
you will learn how to create your own Galaxy flavour mixing a
variety of different tools and visualisations

---

## Why Docker? &lt;br&gt;What is it?

![Image of a blue whale with containers on its back.](../../images/docker_whale.png)

---

### Deployment issues of bioinformatics tools

- Different environments
- Different OS
- Different packaging
- Conflict between tools or versions

&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-long-arrow-right&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Impact on usability and reproducibility

---

### Deployment issue

![Galaxy is a box with many dependencies like node, java, nginx, python, uwsgi, anaconda. On the right knime is another box with java and eclipse dependencies. Lines show the multiplicity of tools and dependencies trying to run on multiple environments with windows/osx/linux desktops, servers, and the cloud.](../../images/deployment_issue.svg)

---

### Deployment issue

Matrix from Hell

![Galaxy and knime form the y axis of a table with a lot of question marks about which environments support them.](../../images/deployment_issue_matrix.svg)

---

### Transport Pre 1960

![Icons for multiple types of goods shown multiple methods for transport and storing.](../../images/cargo_transport_issue.svg)

---

### Transport Pre 1960

Matrix from Hell

![A similar table full of question marks between goods and shipment methods is shown.](../../images/cargo_transport_matrix.svg)

---

### Intermodal shipping container

![A blue shipping container is shown solving the transport problem by being a one size container to fit all sorts of goods, on all sorts of transports.](../../images/cargo_transport_solution.svg)

???

A standard container
- Virtually loading any goods
- Sealed until it reaches final delivery
- Can be
  - loaded and unloaded
  - stacked
  - transported efficiently over long distances
  - transferred from one mode of transport to another

---

### Docker

![Docker logo on a blue shipping container solves the galaxy/knime deployment problem across environments.](../../images/deployment_solution.svg)


???

Docker = An engine that encapsulated any tools as a
- lightweight
- portable
- self sufficient container
- manipulated using standard operations
- run consistently on virtually any hardware platform

---

### A Docker container?

![A schematic with the kernal below and two containers is shown, each container has different stacks.](../../images/WhatIsDocker_1_kernal-2_1.png)

Lightweight and Open

???

- lightweight: same OS kernel, instant start, less RAM use
- open: open standard, run on all major unix distributions and windows

---

### Virtual machines vs Containers

![A cartoon comparing containers vs VMs. On the left the VMs are presented as a layer of server, host os, and hypervisor (type 2) followed by several tall pillars of guest OS, bin/libs and finally their respective apps. Everything is siloed. On the right is containers where the layers are server, host os, and docker engine. Above those are very short pillars of each different app, and when duplicate apps are run, the bin/libs are shown as shared. Text reads: containers are isolated but share OS and where appropriate, bins/libraries.](../../images/container_vs_vm.svg)

Containers more portable and efficient

???

Similar resource isolation and allocation benefits

*but* a different architectural approach

- VM: application +  necessary binaries and libraries + entire guest operating system
  - All of which can amount to tens of GBs
- Container: application and all of its dependencies
  - Share the kernel with other containers
  - Running as isolated processes in user space on the host operating system

---

## How to use Docker?

![A cartoon of a whale with shipping containers atop it.](../../images/docker-usage.jpg)

---

### The client

![A command line is explained, docker is the program you&apos;re using, run is the subcommand that creates and runs a container, and hello-world is the image you want to load.](../../images/docker_command.png)

???

Docker Engine = the core Docker technology on your computer

Client: to talk with Docker

`docker --help`

---

### Containers? Images?

![A single container labelled galaxy with postgres, nginx, and python inside is shown pointing to three other galaxy containers.](../../images/docker_concept_image_container.png)

???

Image:
- recipe that tell how to build your container
- A filesystem and parameters to use at runtime
- snapshot of the content of a container: it doesn&apos;t have state and never changes once built

Container
- a running instance of an image
- you can execute several time the same recipe and if you follow every time the same recipe, you will have the same meal several time. Same for containers

---

### How to get images?

![Images are stored in an image registry which are downloaded with docker pull onto a docker host, where you can run multiple instances of galaxy.](../../images/docker_concept_pull.png)

???

Docker Registry:

- stateless
- highly scalable server side application

to stores and distribute Docker images

Example: docker hub, quay.io

---

### `docker pull`

```sh
$ docker pull hello-world
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
c04b14da8d14: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:0256e8a36e2070f7bf2d0b0763dbabdd67798512411de4cdcf9431a1feb60fd9
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
```

---

### Creation of containers

![Images are stored in an image registry which are downloaded with docker pull onto a docker host, where you can run multiple instances of galaxy.](../../images/docker_concept_run.png)

---

### `docker run`

```sh
$ docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the &quot;hello-world&quot; image from the Docker Hub.
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker Hub account:
 https://hub.docker.com

For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/
```

Can we access the `cowsay` file inside the container? &lt;br&gt;And the `cowsay2` file outside the container?

### Management of data

![A container is shown with an arrow pointing to data and a big x over it.](../../images/docker_volume_closed.png)

???

A container is closed

---

### Management of data

![The same as before, but inside the container it wants to create a new file in that same folder but it cannot.](../../images/docker_volume_open.png)

???

A container is closed

---

### Data volume

![A data volume with two files is shown as a folder, now this is moutned inside two containers.](../../images/docker_volume.png)

???

Data volume
- a specially-designated directory
- within one or more containers
- bypasses the Union File System

Data volumes designed to persist data, independent of the container’s life cycle:
- Initialisation when a container is created
- Possibility of sharing and reusing among containers
- Direct changes to a data volume
- Persistence of data volumes even if the container itself is deleted

---

### Data volume

![Another command line explained, now docker run -v host_dir:container_dir ..., where host_dir is the absolute path or data volume name, and container_dir is where it should be mounted.](../../images/docker_run_volume.png)

???

How to get a data volume?

---

### Data volume

```sh
$ ls data/
cowsay_Galaxy
$ docker run -t -i -v $PWD/data:/data docker/whalesay
root@f4fa8ed32ef8:/cowsay# ls /data
cowsay_Galaxy
root@f4fa8ed32ef8:/cowsay# cowsay Galaxy2 &gt; /data/cowsay_Galaxy2
root@f4fa8ed32ef8:/cowsay# ls /data
cowsay_Galaxy  cowsay_Galaxy2

### Creation of a new image

![A dockerfile built with docker build builds a new container on the local docker host.](../../images/docker_concept_build.png)

???

Need a Dockerfile. I will describe it later. Here it is just to give you a broad overview of the principles

---

### View all images

![Docker image shows a list of all the images on the docker host that can be run.](../../images/docker_concept_image.png)

---

### Push your image on a registry

![Docker push is shown pushing the locally built container to the image registry.](../../images/docker_concept_push.png)

---

&lt;hands-on-title&gt;Hands on! (1)&lt;/hands-on-title&gt;

Play with `quay.io/biocontainers/samtools:1.3--1`

1. Get the image
2. Launch `samtools` container interactively
  1. Print the help page for `samtools`
3. Launch a `samtools` container in detach mode
  1. Check if it exists and find its name
  2. Stop it and restart it
  3. Print the help page using this container

---

&lt;hands-on-title&gt;Hands on! (2)&lt;/hands-on-title&gt;

Play with `quay.io/biocontainers/samtools:1.3--1`

1. Create a local `samtool_dir` directory
2. Launch an interactive container with a volume pointing at the `samtool_dir` directory
  1. Add a [toy sam file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samtools/samtools/develop/examples/toy.sam) into the local `samtool_dir` directory
  2. Check if the existence of the file from inside the container
  3. Visualize the content of the toy file with `samtools view` commands
  4. Generate stats of the toy file into a `toy_stat` file into the local `samtool_dir` directory

???

data volume is the way to make your tool connecting

## How to containerize your tools?

![Cartoon of a docker container](../../images/docker-container.jpg)

???

Now I am sure all of you want to containerize his tool :)

---

### How to create your image?

![Cartoon showing a dockerfile building a container with docker build.](../../images/docker_build.svg)

---

### A Dockerfile?

A text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image

```sh
# Comment
INSTRUCTION arguments
```

.footnote[[Best practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/)]

???

The paper describing the recipe for you container

Review of the commands

### Dockerfile &amp; Layers

## How to integrate Galaxy inside Docker Container?

---

### Galaxy Docker Container

A Docker launching a Galaxy instance and

- FTP-Server
- Webserver
- Scheduler
- Process control UI
- ToolShed ready
- Interactive Environment ready


```
docker run -i -t -p 8080:80 bgruening/galaxy-stable:18.05
```

Visit your machine on port 8080 to see Galaxy running.

https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable

---

&lt;hands-on-title&gt;Hands on!&lt;/hands-on-title&gt;

Launch a Galaxy Docker Container and try to

- Add Data
- Become an Admin
- Restart Galaxy
- Use export mounts (persistent data)
- Trouble shooting (logging)
- Install tools
- ...

---

### Galaxy + SLURM = &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-heart&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
