                <p>For the hands-on examples you need access to a Galaxy server and access to its PostgreSQL database. You can set-up this yourself, or use the Galaxy Docker Image provided by Björn Grüning (https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable). During this tutorial, we will work with the Galaxy Docker Image.</p>

<p>Setting up Docker and using the Galaxy Docker Image:
(please do this before the tutorial, preferably when you are still at home using a fast internet connection)</p>

<p>Follow the instruction to install the Docker engine: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/ <br />
Execute:  docker run -d -p 8080:80 bgruening/galaxy-stable
(this will download the Galaxy Docker Image, when executed the first time, and
start it)
Test the Docker image in your web browser: http://localhost:8080
(see first paragraph of Björn’s introduction, for special cases when using the
Docker Toolbox on Mac and Windows). Quit by: docker kill NAME (you get the name with:  docker ps )</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="database-versus-object-model">Database versus Object Model</h2>

<p>The session description is database centric and we’ll be focusing on the relational
database that backs Galaxy servers.  But that’s only half the picture of the this data.
The other is the object model which is the object-oriented view of this same data.
The object model is used by the code to manipulate and access the database.
The translation between the two worlds is handled by an object-relational mapping implemented with SQLAlchemy (https://www.sqlalchemy.org).</p>

<p>Today we are covering the database and how to access it with SQL.  We aren’t going to cover the corresponding object model or object relational mapping.</p>

<h2 id="database-platform">Database Platform</h2>

<p>The default out-of-the-box Galaxy installation uses SQLite (https://www.sqlite.org).
SQLite is a lightweight database management system (DBMS) that can be packaged inside Galaxy and does not require any additional steps at initial setup time.</p>

<p>However, SQLite is not the recommended DBMS for running a Galaxy server. The recommended production DMBS for
Galaxy is PostgreSQL (https://www.postgresql.org). PostgreSQL offers a full set of DBMS features and robust support for multiple simultaneous users.</p>

<p>This workshop will be entirely based in PostgreSQL (also referred to as Postgres).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-in-and-not-in-the-galaxy-database">What is in (and not in) the Galaxy database?</h2>

<p>The Galaxy database contains management information about your server.  The database tracks users, groups, jobs, histories, datasets, workflows and so on.</p>

<p>What’s not in the database is the data. Datasets are stored outside the database. The database does keep metadata – information about the datasets such as data type. The tools themselves are not stored in the database either.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-database-schema">Understanding the Database Schema</h2>

<h4 id="er-diagrams-and-schemaspy">ER diagrams and SchemaSpy</h4>

<p>Entity-relationship diagrams are a way to understand tables and the relationships between them
inside a relational database.  SchemaSpy (http://schemaspy.org) is a free (and remarkable tool) for
generating ER diagrams. Here’s a <a href="../../images/galaxy_schema.png">diagram of the Galaxy database</a>
(generated by SchemaSpy on June 6 2020; 6Mb).</p>

<p>The “Tables” tab is a good place to start learning the structure of the database.  Each table represents a different type of thing, and often that thing is itself a relationship. For example, each record in the dataset table has information about a specific dataset, while records in the history_dataset_association table have information about what histories that dataset is in.</p>

<p>Each SchemaSpy table’s page shows the attributes in that table, as well as any constraints on those attributes, and the relationships between that table and other tables.</p>

<p>Also see the “Run SchemaSpy in this container” section below for how to install and then run SchemaSpy yourself.</p>

<h4 id="database-conventions">Database conventions</h4>
<p>The Galaxy database uses a number of naming and design conventions.  Understanding these can make navigating the database much easier.</p>

<h4 id="id-attributes">id attributes</h4>
<p>Every table has an id column that uniquely identifies each row.  (The id column is the primary key in database terminology.) Beyond uniquely identifying a row in the table, ID values have no meaning.  ID values are unique within a table, but not across the database.</p>

<h4 id="relationships-between-tables-and-_id-columns">Relationships between tables, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_id</code> columns</h4>
<p>Relationships between tables are implemented by exporting id columns from one table into another.  Imported ids are called foreign keys in database nomenclature, and are uniformly named
   table_the_id_came_from_id</p>

<p>There are a few notable exceptions to this rule.  If the ID is from a table that is prefixed with galaxy_, for example, galaxy_user or galaxy_session, the  galaxy_ will be dropped from the column name.  For example, galaxy_user.id becomes user_id in the over 50 tables it is imported into</p>

<h4 id="relationship-tables">Relationship tables</h4>

<p>As mentioned previously, some tables, such as history_dataset_association represent relationships between things, rather than things themselves.  In this case history_dataset_association describes relationships between datasets and histories.</p>

<p>Relationship table names typically contain the names of tables they are relating, suffixed with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_association</code>.</p>

<p>Why are nulls allowed in almost every column?
We have no idea.  In practice, they aren’t nulls in most of those columns.</p>

<p>Why aren’t there comments, on anything?
PostgreSQL supports comments to table definitions, but there are none shown in the SchemaSpy report. Why? The table definitions are actually generated by SQLAlchemy, the object-relational mapping software used by Galaxy, and SQLAlchemy does not support it.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the database that results from direct manipulation of the table definitions through DDL.  Everything comes in through SQLAlchemy.</p>
