# Built in Data

![List_of_data.png](../../images/i06-List_of_data.png)

---

# Data, what data?

.large[
* Some genomes are large! Human, Mouse, Coral
* Some tools require indices of the genomes.
* The indices take a long time to build!
* Better to pre-build the indices.

# Using reference data in a tool

#### bwa.xml

```xml
<conditional name="reference_source">
      <param name="reference_source_selector" type="select" label="Will you select a reference genome from your history or use a built-in index?" help="Built-ins were indexed using default options. See 'Indexes' section of help below">
        <option value="cached">Use a built-in genome index</option>
        <option value="history">Use a genome from history and build index</option>
      </param>
      <when value="cached">
        <param name="ref_file" type="select" label="Using reference genome" help="Select genome from the list">
          <options from_data_table="bwa_mem_indexes">
            <filter type="sort_by" column="2" />
            <validator type="no_options" message="No indexes are available" />
          </options>
          <validator type="no_options" message="A built-in reference genome is not available for the build associated with the selected input file"/>

# Where are the data tables?

#### tool_data_table_conf.xml

(Usually located in `galaxy/config/`)

```xml
  <tables>
    <!-- Locations of indexes in the BWA mapper format -->
    <table name="bwa_mem_indexes" comment_char="#" allow_duplicate_entries="False">
      <columns>value, dbkey, name, path</columns>
      <file path="tool-data/bwa_index.loc" />
    </table>
  </tables>
```

# "loc" files - Short for location!

bwa_index.loc

```text
#

# Some Problems!

.large[
* Time consuming!
  * ~30 minutes work just to add a new genome to 1 tool!

* Administrator needs to know:
  * how to index **every** tool
  * expected format of the reference data
  * format of the .loc file

# Other concerns

.large[
* **Accessible?**
  * Manually download genome FASTA files
  * Download, compile, run bwa index; which options?
* **Reproducible?**
  * Only if the person performing manual steps keeps good notes
* **Transparent?**
  * Send email to sysadmin asking for notes
  * Restart Galaxy server for new entries

# Data Managers

.large[
* Allows for the **creation of built-in** (reference) data
	* underlying data
	* data tables
	* \*.loc files

* Specialized Galaxy tools that can only be accessed by an admin

* Defined **locally** or installed from **ToolShed**
]

---

# Data Managers

.large[
* **Flexible** framework
  * Not just genomic data
  * Run Data Managers through UI
  * Workflow compatible
  * API
* Examples
  * Adding new genome builds (dbkeys)
  * Fetching genome (fasta) sequences
  * Building short read mapper indices for genomes

# Special class of Galaxy tool

Looks just like a normal Galaxy tool!

![Data-manager-ui.png](../../images/Data-manager-ui.png)

---

# What does it do?

The output of the data manager is a JSON description of the new data table entry

![data_table_JSON.png](../../images/data_table_JSON.png)

This gets turned into a new data table entry

![data_table_entry.png](../../images/data_table_entry.png)

The index files themselves get placed in the appropriate location.

# Data Managers Admin

.large[
* Located on the Galaxy's Admin Tab under **Local Data**

![data_managers_tool_list.png](../../images/data_managers_tool_list.png)

# Data Managers Admin

.large[
* UI tools to fetch reference genomes/build indices
* View progress of index build jobs
* View contents of tool data tables

# There's a lot of reference data

# CernVM-FS to the rescue

* Needed a method of sharing reference data across country efficiently
* **CVMFS** is an efficient method for read only data sharing between systems
    * Originally designed for distributed software installation at Cern
    * Turns out it's really useful for read only data sets as well
    * HTTP-based, firewall friendly
* All nodes of Galaxy Main get their reference genomes and indices from CVMFS
    * Shared via mirroring and caching across the country
* It's also really useful to share data **globally**
    * The **usegalaxy.*** initiative has taken full advantage of this.
