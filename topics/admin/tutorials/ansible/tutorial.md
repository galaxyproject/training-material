# Overview
{:.no_toc}

In this tutorial we have briefly cover what ansible is and how to understand what it does. This guide is not meant to make you an expert on ansible, but perhaps give you enough that you can debug broken roles and modify them to suit your needs. Or maybe to contribute to the [Galaxyproject Ansible roles](https://github.com/galaxyproject?q=ansible)

This will be a very practical training with emphasis on looking at examples from modules and becoming self sufficient.

# What is Ansible?

Ansible runs commands on local or remote computers. It can move files around, create files from templates, and run command line tools. Primarily used for system administration tasks at scale. It has a push model rather than a pull model like puppet. If you've used puppet, ansible doesn't evaluate what changes need to be made and make those, it just runs through all of commands every time.

Some terms that you should know first:

Term           | Usage
-------------- | --------
hosts files    | Not `/etc/hosts`, instead this is an ansible specific file that defines groups of hosts
ansible module | A piece of python code that converts some parameters into an invocation. An example would be the `exec` module which converts parameters like `command: ls` into a command line that is executed.
tasks          | Yaml file(s) that contain a list of ansible modules that should be executed and the configuration for these modules. There are pre-built modules for just about everything
role           | A folder containing some tasks, templates, files, and default values for variables. People share roles on ["Ansible Galaxy"](https://galaxy.ansible.com/)
playbook       | a yaml file listing a set of roles that should be applied to a group of hosts
vault          | An encrypted yaml file. You put your secrets here and then you can use them in tasks/roles/playbooks.

Looking at each of these briefly:

## Hosts file

```ini
[webservers]
web_a
web_b

[databases]
db_1.fqdn.edu ansible_user=root
```

Here we've defined two groups of computers, `webservers` and `databases`. You can use `ansible_user` to specify which user to connect with.

## Roles

We will look at [ansible-cvmfs](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-cvmfs) as our example for the layout of a role:

```
├── defaults
│   └── main.yml
├── files
│   ├── cvmfs_wipecache.c
│   ├── cvmfs_wipecache.centos_6
│   └── cvmfs_wipecache.centos_7
├── handlers
│   └── main.yml
├── meta
│   └── main.yml
├── tasks
│   └── main.yml
└── templates
    └── stratum1_squid.conf.j2
```

These are the folders that are included in many complex roles. Simpler roles will often not need all of the folders.

Folder    | Usage
--------- | ------
defaults  | Default variables values go here (e.g. "version of software to install")
files     | These are files which should be copied as-is over to the remote location
handlers  | This is for restarting processes usually
meta      | Only needed if you publish your role to ansible galaxy
tasks     | **Always start reading here**. This is the most important file and the best place to start when trying to understand what an unfamiliar module does. Anything that is loaded will be referenced here, e.g. variables to load, handlers, files, templates.
templates | Files that are templated out with variables before being copied

## Modules and Tasks

Your `tasks/main.yml` file calls multiple Ansible modules to accomplish its goal. A tasks file looks like:

```yaml
---
- name: Install CernVM-FS client (yum)
  yum:
    name: cvmfs
    state: {% raw %}"{{ 'latest' if cvmfs_upgrade_client else 'present' }}"{% endraw %}
  when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"

- name: Ensure AutoFS is enabled + running
  service:
    name: autofs
    enabled: yes
    state: started
```

Here we have two tasks. Each has a `name` that will be shown to the person running the playbook.

The first invokes the `yum` module with the arguments `name: cvmfs, state: ...`. This will use yum to install the package named `cvmfs`. The state parameter uses a jinja2 template to evaluate the value of the variable `cvmfs_upgrade_client`. We can [grep through](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-cvmfs/search?q=cvmfs_upgrade_client&unscoped_q=cvmfs_upgrade_client) the repository and see that `defaults/main.yml` sets that to `false` by default. We can override this if we need, we'll come back to that later. The first task also has a `when` condition to ensure it only runs on RHEL family machines, so RedHat or CentOS. It is better to use the [`package`](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/package_module.html) module which will be OS-generic.

The second invokes the [`service`](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/service_module.html) module. The arguments to this one are quite legible and the functionality can be inferred from the names for the most part: The service `name: autofs` will be `enabled` and its `state` should be `started`.

### Stylistic Choices

Ansible accepts two ways to format tasks:

YAML style:

```
- package:
    name: "{{ package_name }}"
    state: "{{ package_state }}"
```

And an inline style.

```
- package name={{ package_name }} state={{ package_state }}
```

Some groups prefer one style or another. You can mix both of these but you probably shouldn't. The inline style does not require quoting of templated values.

## Playbooks

```
- name: CVMFS
  hosts: webservers
  vars:
    cvmfs_numfiles: 4096
  roles:
    - galaxyproject.cvmfs
```

This is a quite minimal playbook. It selects a `hosts` group named `webservers`, overrides the variable `cvmfs_numfiles`, and then says the following set of roles will be executed for this group of hosts. Ansible makes it easy to collect tasks that should apply to a group of hosts and run a playbook for all of those hosts. Some good uses of this are things like ensuring a certain set of users are installed on all of your managed machines, or using one of the package autoupdating roles to make sure your machines are up-to-date.

> ### {% icon tip %} Ansible Playbook Documentation
>
> For more information check out [the official documentation on this topic](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html)
{: .tip}

### Philosophies

Different groups use playbooks differently. Here is a non-exhaustive list of ways that the author has seen playbooks used:

Strategy                                | Use Cases
--------------------------------------- | ---
A single playbook that does everything  | Works well in cloud use cases where you would rather terminate a VM and just restart from nothing. If 100% of the tasks are idempotent (can be re-run without causing problems) then this can also work well for ensuring all machines that are managed are meeting your compliance standards.
Playbooks that execute one-off commands | Works well when you have commands that cannot safely be re-run (e.g. you are managing a repository on a remote machine and executing a 'commit' action.) Also works if you have multiple people who are responsible for managing a machine but you want to ensure exactly the same commands are run each time a task needs to be done, with no variation.

## Variables

There are a bunch of places variables can be set. [The list is ridiculous.](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#variable-precedence-where-should-i-put-a-variable) Try and find a convention within your group and stick to that to help manage the chaos.

There are some special places you can put variables that will be loaded automatically:

- `group_vars/<group_name>.yml`: if you run a playbook which has `hosts: webservers`, and `group_vars/webservers.yml` exists, it will be loaded.
- `host_vars/<host_name>.yml`: if you run a playbook and it affects host (e.g.) `api01`, and `host_vars/api01.yml` exists, it will be loaded automatically.

For a real-life example, UseGalaxy.eu [generally attempts](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook) to put variables in an appropriately named `group_vars/` file.

## Vaults

[`ansible-vault`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html) is a super useful tool that lets you encrypt secrets for your group using a pre-shared key. This allows you to commit ALL of your ansible playbooks and variables to source control, without the concern of leaking secrets. E.g. [UseGalaxy.eu](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/blob/master/secret_group_vars/all.yml)'s vault file. The encrypted version is not very interesting to look at, but it is mostly to show that we confidently place an encrypted copy of our secrets online, under configuration management. This has made our life a lot easier.


# Your First Playbook and First Role

The above introduction was certainly not enough for you to feel confident in Ansible, so we will now build a small role and a playbook to run this role.

> ### {% icon warning %} Safety First
>
> Many of the things you can do with Ansible can be quite dangerous. As dangerous as normally being at the linux command line, but scaled across N machines. Be very careful with the changes you plan to make.
> Ansible provides some flags which can help you identify changes before they're made to production systems:
>
> **`--diff`**
> :    This will show the difference whenever a file is changed.
>
> **`--check`**
> :    Will do a dry-run of the playbook, attempting to show you which tasks will execute, which files will be updated. Not all actions can be predicted because commands are not run, if a downstream task depends on the result of a command execution task, ansible has no way of knowing whether or not it will execute
>
> In this tutorial we will write to files in `/tmp` as that is a *relatively* safe thing to do. The training material community does not have the resources to test this tutorial across all of the platforms you might want to run it on. Additionally we do not want to be responsible if you accidentally cause permanent damage by following this tutorial.

Usually by searching the internet for "ansible $do-some-action" e.g. "ansible copy file to server" or "ansible restart service." If you cannot find a module that does it, there is the [`command`](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/command_module.html) module, but this should be avoided if possible. Expect to have a browser session with 10-30 different ansible module documentation tabs if you work with ansible regularly, no one remembers what arguments are available to this or that module.

Now that you've done this, here are some starting points for exploration:

- Add more hosts, watch as ansible executes over all of them in parallel.
- Identify a task you do regularly, e.g. restarting a service. Find the ansible service module and add that to your playbook.

> ### {% icon tip %} Too Many Cows?
> If you've installed the `cowsay` tool, ansible (for some reason) will take advantage of that to output a lot of the output with cowsay. To disable this you can `export ANSIBLE_NOCOWS=1` (Remember that exporting will only last as long as the current invocation of your terminal does, so consider adding this to your user profile if you wish to keep cowsay installed and still have legible output.)

## Facts

In the last step of the last hands on, you ran your playbook. The first `TASK` that was executed was not one that you had written, it read:

```
TASK [Gathering Facts] *************************
ok: [localhost]
```

The [`setup`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/setup_module.html) module runs by default for every host and gathers facts about the host.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: The Setup Module
>
> 1. Run the command `ansible -i hosts -c local -m setup my_hosts`.
>
>    The `my_hosts` at the end refers to the group we defined in our hosts file.
>
> 2. Investigate the output. See what sort of information is made available to you.
>
>    > ### {% icon question %} Question
>    >
>    > 1. What variable stores the OS name?
>    > 2. Where are all of the places that you can find your machine's IP (v4) addresses?
>    >
>    > > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
>    > >
>    > > 1. The OS name is stored in `ansible_distribution`. We saw `ansible_os_family` used above in the ansible-cvmfs role. You can use these variables if you are writing a generic role but packages or commands are named different on different operating systems.
>    > >
>    > > 2. Ansible stores network information in quite a few places, sometimes one place is more convenient or more correct to use:
>    > >
>    > >    - `ansible_all_ipv4_addresses`
>    > >    - `ansible_default_ipv4`
>    > >    - `ansible_<interface_name>.ipv4`
>    > >
>    > {: .solution }
>    >
>    {: .question}

{: .hands_on}


## Templates

Templates give you greater control over the files you are deploying to the remote system. If you need to deploy a file to multiple hosts, but configure it differently on each host, you should use templates. For instance deploying a service that should only listen on the correct IP address for that host would be a good use case for templates. All of the facts you discovered in the previous hands on are available to you to use in templates, `when` statements (like the [ansible-cvmfs example we saw earlier](#modules-and-tasks)). Additionally all of the variables you've defined are available as well.

> ### {% icon tip %} Template Syntax
> Templates use Jinja2 syntax. If you are not familiar with it, you should [read about it](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/) first, before moving on with the tutorial.

# Ansible Galaxy

Now that you've built a small role, you can imagine that building real roles that manage the full installation of a piece of software are not simple things. Ansible Galaxy is the answer here. Many roles for common administration tasks and software installation + setup are readily available on ansible-galaxy.

**Warning**: This will install git on the remote machine.

If you want to become a different user, just set `become_user`. Beware, the user should be able to privilege escalate without a password prompt. Otherwise when you execute the playbook you should set `--ask-become-pass`, using the privilege escalation password for that host.

## Choosing a Role

Picking the best role for a task from Ansible Galaxy is not always a trivial task. Sometimes there will only be a single role doing what you need. Other times you'll have to choose between 20 different roles that all look more or less the same. Here are some tips to guide you in identifying appropriate and well-written roles:

- The name should match the software you are using (I.e. ignore a role named `stackstorm` when you are trying to set up `rabbitmq`. Ansible Galaxy does not have perfect search.)
- `geerlingguy` wrote a huge number of roles for many pieces of standard software. If there is a role from this person, this is usually a safe choice.
- Check the GitHub readme of each role you consider using. Look for:
  - Extensive documentation of all of the variables, their default values, and how they behave.
  - An example playbook using the role
- A large number of downloads is a good sign that other people found it useful

These are usually good proxies for quality, but do not treat them as strict rules. For an example of a role meeting many of these qualities, [`ansible-cvmfs`](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-cvmfs) is good; the variables are well documented and there are example playbooks that you can (more or less) copy-and-paste and run.

Sometimes a role will accomplish 95% of what you need to do, but not everything. Once you have installed the role with `ansible-galaxy install`, you can edit it locally to make any changes. In an ideal world you would contribute this back, but this is not always a high priority. Many projects copy roles directly into their repositories, e.g. [galaxyproject](https://github.com/galaxyproject/infrastructure-playbook/tree/master/roles) and [usegalaxy.eu](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/tree/master/roles)

# Other Stuff

Ansible has a huge array of features and we can't cover them all. Some commonly used features are documented below:

## With Items

Duplicating tasks ten times to install ten packages isn't efficient, so ansible provides `with_items` construct

```yaml
- name: Install stuff
  package:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: installed
  with_items:
    - htop
    - git
    - vim
```

This works for any task, not just package installation if you have things you'd like to repeat.

## When Changed

Doing something only when a task is in the "changed" state is a common pattern. This is often used for reloading a service when some configuration files have changed.

```yaml

- name: Copy configuration file
  copy:
    src: main.conf
    dest: "/etc/service/main.conf
    owner: "root"
    group: "root"
    mode: "0644"
  register: service_conf

- name: Restart the service
  service:
    name: service
    enabled: yes
    state: restarted
  when: service_conf.changed
```

## Notifying Handlers

Often you want to restart a service whenever something has changed, like above. But if you need to restart the service whenever one of many different tasks has changed, there is a simpler way than writing `when: a.changed or b.changed or c.changed or ...`

First, move the restarting or reloading of the service into the `handlers/main.yml`

```
- name: restart service
  service:
    name: service
    enabled: yes
    state: restarted

- name: reload httpd
  service:
    name: httpd
    enabled: yes
    state: reloaded
```

Now you can change your task definitions:

```
- name: Copy configuration file
  copy:
    src: main.conf
    dest: "/etc/service/main.conf
    owner: "root"
    group: "root"
    mode: "0644"
  notify: 'restart service'
```

We no longer `register` the command, instead the `notify` attribute automatically marks that the appropriate handler should be called *at the end of the playbook run*. Additionally tasks from outside of this role can use the same `notify`. So if you use a community built role for managing apache, and then have a custom role that builds the apache configuration, you can use changes there to reload the service using their definition of the reload/restart.
