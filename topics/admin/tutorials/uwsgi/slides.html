# What is uWSGI?

- Python WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) application framework
- Written in C
- Forking application server
- Optional HTTP server
- Process manager

...and the rest of the kitchen sink

???

- What is uWSGI?
- It&apos;s a framework for writting web applications.
- uWSGI itself is written in C, but can run programs in different languages with a compatible interface.
- It handles a lot of the scaling issues for us.

---

# Why do we need uWSGI?

- Galaxy is a Python web application without a web server
- Implements standard Python WSGI
- Some other application does the web serving
- Technically we could use any HTTP/WSGI interface
  - Traditionally [Python Paste](https://github.com/cdent/paste/)

???

- We need uWSGI because Galaxy doesn&apos;t include a web server.
- So Galaxy implements the standard Python WSGI interface.
- And another application can handle the web serving.

---

# What is uWSGI used for?

.left[In a production Galaxy server:]
- To start, manage, and scale web workers
- Optionally, to start, manage, and scale job handlers

???

- Galaxy uses uWSGI to start, manage, and scale web workers.
- Additionally it can be used for web-less job handlers if you use that setup.

---

# Why uWSGI?

Because Python can&apos;t multithread.

![Python GIL](../../images/gil.png)

.footnote[Image credit: [Dariusz Fryta](http://www.tivix.com/blog/lets-go-python/)]

???

- Python cannot do multithreading due to the GIL or Global Interpreter Lock.
- However, python is multiprocess capable.
- uWSGI will provide our scalability.

---

# Why uWSGI?

- Fork many Galaxy server processes
- Isolate job functions from web functions
- Built in load balancing
- Speak native high performance uWSGI protocol to nginx
- Uninterrupted restarting
- Can do anything you can imagine: [uWSGI configuration options](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Options.html)

???

- uWSGI can fork as many Galaxy processes as we need.
- Then it provides some built in load balancing with mules or zerg-mode.
- It has a high-performance protocol that nginx and apache both speak, for more efficiency.
- uWSGI enables uninterrupted restarts, which users love.

---

## uWSGI

- **Configuration**
- uWSGI wheel
- Job handler mules

???

- There are three main sections we&apos;ll cover: Configuration, wheels, and mules.
- First, configuration.

---

## uWSGI Configuration File

uWSGI configuration is performed in the `uwsgi` key of `galaxy.yml`.

`galaxy.yml.sample` is never consulted.

.left[If using `run.sh`:]
- If no config exists, all necessary defaults are generated as command line arguments to uWSGI
- If a config exists, it is parsed, and any missing required options are passed as command line arguments to uWSGI

**Galaxy servers deployed with Ansible do not use `run.sh` and should fully specify their uWSGI configuration.**

???

- uWSGI configuration is done in the uWSGI block of the galaxy yaml file.
- The run shell script is not used in production, but has convenient behaviour for those users.

---

## uWSGI default command line

Without a config file, the uWSGI command line is:

```sh-session
$ /home/nate/galaxy/.venv/bin/python3 .venv/bin/uwsgi \
    --module &apos;galaxy.webapps.galaxy.buildapp:uwsgi_app()&apos; \
    --virtualenv /home/nate/galaxy/.venv --pythonpath lib \
    --threads 4 --http localhost:8080 \
    --static-map /static=/home/nate/galaxy/static --die-on-term \
    --hook-master-start &apos;unix_signal:2 gracefully_kill_them_all&apos; \
    --hook-master-start &apos;unix_signal:15 gracefully_kill_them_all&apos; \
    --enable-threads --py-call-osafterfork
```

???

- The default uWSGI command line is quite complex with numerous arguments.
- It must specify a module to load and a function to run.
- A python path and virtualenv are loaded as well.
- A number of threads is specified and an HTTP port on which to listen.
- Static files required special mapping and some signal handling to ensure cleanup.

---

## uWSGI command line

.left[Behind the scenes, `run.sh` calls `scripts/get_uwsgi_args.py`, which:]
- locates your config file (if any),
- parses it to determine whether you have set any of the default (or conflicting) options,
- determines the flags needed to run Galaxy.

You can take &quot;full control&quot; over this process by skipping `run.sh` and simply calling `uwsgi` directly, e.g. `uwsgi --yaml config/galaxy.yml`.

???

- If you&apos;re using run.sh, it calls a python script to determine the command line.
- With Ansible this configuration is written in the galaxy yaml file.

---

# uWSGI communication

- uWSGI can serve HTTP directly using the `--http` option
- uWSGI speaks a native protocol (which nginx also speaks) using `--socket`

A proxy server is not *required,* but its use is strongly encouraged for performance reasons.

???

- uWSGI can speak either HTTP or it&apos;s own native protocol.
- While a proxy server is not required, it is strongly encouraged.
- It can use this more efficient uWSGI protocol and provide additional performance.
- A proxy server can proxy static files, freeing uWSGI to focus on computation.

---

## YAML config

uWSGI natively supports YAML configs (and INI, and PasteDeploy INI, and XML, and JSON, and ...)

**WARNING:** &quot;uWSGI YAML&quot; is not real YAML!

.pull-left[
Real YAML
```yaml
uwsgi:
    # quoting forces string
    socket: &apos;127.0.0.1:8001&apos;
    # proper YAML list
    mule:
      - lib/galaxy/main.py
      - lib/galaxy/main.py
```
]

.pull-right[
uWSGI &quot;YAML&quot;
```yaml
uwsgi:
    # quote chars read literally
    socket: &apos;127.0.0.1:8001&apos;
    # a uWSGI YAML &quot;list&quot;:
    #  repeat keys
    mule: lib/galaxy/main.py
    mule: lib/galaxy/main.py
```
]

???

- uWSGI natively supports YAML configuration as well as a number of other formats.
- However, uWSGI&apos;s YAML is not the same as real YAML.
- It uses repeated keys for lists.

---

## YAML config

- &quot;uWSGI YAML&quot; only applies to the `uwsgi` section of `galaxy.yml`
  - The `galaxy` section must use real YAML
- uWSGI can be compiled against libyaml for real YAML support
- Galaxy Ansible role can write *both* uWSGI (default), real YAML

???

- As a result of this uWSGI flavour of YAML, both are mixed in the Galaxy configuration file.
- The Galaxy section must use proper YAML.
- But not to worry! Ansible takes care of this dual-language configuration.
- And you never have to worry about it.

---

## Configuration Schema

.center[`[config_schema.yml][config-schema]` contains possible options **and their types**.]

.left[config_schema.yml is the canonical source for config option documentation, from which:]
- .left[`[galaxy.yml.sample][config-sample]` is generated]
- [Galaxy configuration options documentation][config-docs] is generated

[config-schema]: https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/release_20.09/lib/galaxy/webapps/galaxy/config_schema.yml
[config-sample]: https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/release_20.09/lib/galaxy/config/sample/galaxy.yml.sample
[config-docs]: https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/config.html

???

- Galaxy has a listing of every configuration option in the config_schema file.
- This is used to generate the sample file and the documentation.

---

## uWSGI

- Configuration
- **uWSGI wheel**
- Job handler mules

???

- The next main aspect of uWSGI is distribution, or wheels.

---

## uWSGI Wheel

Galaxy&apos;s uWSGI is not built like standard `pip install uwsgi`

A bit of technical minutiae that might help debugging

???

- Galaxy&apos;s uWSGI is not a standard package.
- This is minutiae but it might help whenever you need to debug uWSGI issues.

---

## uWSGI Wheel

- The challenge:
  - Unlike Galaxy&apos;s other framework dependencies, uWSGI is not a Python library
  - uWSGI embeds the CPython interpreter
  - Essentially uWSGI *is* Galaxy&apos;s CPython

???

- At the beginning we discussed it was a C program, uWSGI is not a python library.
- So uWSGI embeds the CPython interpreter.

--

- The goal: Provide a no-compilation-required, no-dependencies installation method for Galaxy that includes uWSGI that:
  - Doesn&apos;t embed statically linked CPython
  - Doesn&apos;t require system `libpythonX.Y.so`
  - Uses system CPython

???

- There are good reasons for this odd setup.
- Our goal was to provide a compilation and dependency free method for installation.
- Additionally it should not require system python libraries.


---

## uWSGI Wheel

The uWSGI wheel is built differently than when built from source with

`pip install uwsgi`

- From source by pip:
  - Built as a single `uwsgi` ELF binary embedding the CPython interpreter
- As the pyuwsgi wheel:
  - Built as a Python C extension into an ELF shared library `pyuwsgi.so`
  - Loaded by a stub `uwsgi` Python script by the CPython interpreter

pyuwsgi wheel: the only way to precompile uWSGI in a way that does not require `libpythonX.Y.so` or ship CPython

???

- The uWSGI wheel is just built differently.
- When it&apos;s built from source by pip, it comes as a single binary with CPython.
- When it&apos;s usgin the wheel, it&apos;s built as a Python C extension.
- This is loaded by a stub uWSGI script.
- This complex method was the only one to achieve our goals.

---

## uWSGI

- Configuration
- uWSGI wheel
- **Job handler mules**

???

- Lastly, we&apos;ll talk about job handling and mules.

---
class: top

## Processes and Job Handling

uWSGI starts up in a single &quot;master&quot; process and then `fork()`s a configured number of anonymous *web worker* processes to **serve web requests**.

By default, web workers also handle Galaxy job (tool execution) preparation and completion.

???

- So how are processes and jobs handled with uWSGI?
- uWSGI starts up in a single &quot;master&quot; process and forks some copies.
- By default these also handle jobs.

--

Processing Galaxy job (tool execution) preparation and finishing is somewhat resource intensive and affects web responsiveness.

Production Galaxy servers traditionally start additional dedicated Galaxy &quot;webless&quot; (do not serve web requests) *job handler* processes.

???

- Processing galaxy jobs is quite resource intensive and can affect web responsiveness.
- As a result, typically web handling and job handling are in separate processes.

--

uWSGI provides a useful feature for running Galaxy job handlers: [uWSGI Mules](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Mules.html).

???

- uWSGI has a feature called mules which we use for handlers.

---

## uWSGI Mules

**Mules** are processes `fork()`ed from the uWSGI master after the application has been loaded and web workers have `fork()`ed.

Mules can continue to run the same code or can load and run arbitrary code.

Mules can receive messages from the web proceses.

Mules can be pooled in to *Farms*, and messages can be sent to the farm to be handled by any mule in that farm.

???

- Mules are processes forked after the application has loaded.
- Mules can continue to run the same code or load more.
- Mules can communicate with the master.
- Optionally they can live in pools called farms, e.g. one for job handlers.

---

## Mule Advantages

.pull-left.reduce90[
Webless handlers
- Config is complex
- Must manage handler processes externally (e.g. w/ systemd)
- Handler assignment:
  - At random from configured handlers
  - No regard as to handler health
  - Notification via database
- Can be spread across multiple hosts
]

.pull-right.reduce90[
uWSGI Mule handlers
- Config is trivial
- Handler processes managed automatically by uWSGI master
- Handler assignment:
  - &quot;Grabbed&quot; by healthy mule
  - IPC (messaging) from web worker
- Mules run on same host as web workers
]

???

- Webless handlers can be quite complex to setup and manage.
- Mules offer a very simple alternative.
- However, this requires they run on the same host, which is usually ok.

---

## Job Handler Mule Configuration

Adding job handler mules is performed by simply instructing uWSGI to start them in `galaxy.yml`:

```yaml
uwsgi:
    mule: lib/galaxy/main.py
    mule: lib/galaxy/main.py
    farm: job-handlers:1,2
```

That&apos;s it! This Galaxy instance will now start and use two job handler mules.

???

- Mules can be defined by adding them to Galaxy&apos;s configuration in the uWSGI section.
- Farms collect groups of mules.

---

class: top

## uWSGI Start/Run and Job Handling Lifecycle

1. Master process loads Galaxy application.

???

- We&apos;ll go quickly through the entire lifecycle of a Galaxy process.
- First, the master uWSGI process loads Galaxy

--

2. Master `fork()`s web worker processes and begins serving web requests.

???

- This forks worker processes to serve web requests

--

3. Master `fork()`s job handler mules.

???

- Then mules are forked.

--

4. Mules reload Galaxy application as job handlers.

???

- Mules reload the application to behave as handlers.

--

5. The first mule to fully initialize grabs a lock on the farm message queue.

???

- The first mule ready establishes an exclusive lock on the queue

--

6. All additional mules wait on the lock.

???

- Additional mules wait and compete to access the queue.

--

7. A web worker receives a request for a new job.

???

- Next, a user visits Galaxy and submits a job.

--

8. The web worker creates a `job` record in the database but leaves the `handler` field `null`.

???

- The web worker creates a job in the database, but leaves it unassigned.

--

9. The web worker uses uWSGI&apos;s `farm_msg()` function to notify the `job-handlers` farm that a new job is ready to run.

???

- The worker pings the job handler farm that a new job is ready to run

--

10. The mule with the lock receives the message, assigns itself, and gives up the lock.

???

- The mule with the lock assigns itself and gives up the lock to go process the job.

--

11. Another mule acquires the lock and waits for the next message.

???

- Another mule acquires a lock and waits patiently.

--

12. Repeat

???

- This process repeats to process jobs.

---

## Advanced: Job Handler Assignment Methods

**Mules can only be used if web workers and job handlers run on the same host.**

The database can be used like a message queue to get the benefits of mules using webless job handlers.

See [Job Handler Assignment Methods](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/scaling.html#job-handler-assignment-methods) for details.

Mules are preferred in scenarios where webless handlers are not needed.

???

- Mules are easy to setup, if you can run them on the same host.
- This is usually the case.
- If you have a more complex setup you might need webless job handlers.
- There is documentation for when you need it.

---

## Advanced: Transparent Restart

Provides uninterrupted restart capability (clients do not notice restarts).

See [Transparent Restart](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/scaling.html#transparent-restart-zerg-mode) and [uWSGI Zerg Mode documentation](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Zerg.html) for details.

???

- Zerg mode (named after the game StarCraft) can be used for transparent restarts.
- Users really like this, and it gives you freedom to make changes behind the scenes.

---

## Advanced: Zerg Mode + Job Handler Mules

Combining both advanced modes was long thought to be impossible.

However, a proof of concept has emerged!

[Watch this space](https://gist.github.com/natefoo/6e45ae363ef434f38a935ff1b05b4b6e).

???

- Combining both was not thought to be possible but there is ongoing work.
- A proof of concept exists, but it is not in any Ansible playbook yet.
