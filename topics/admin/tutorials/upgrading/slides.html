# Release Cycle

* Galaxy aims to release every 4 months
* Releases are named after the **year** and **month** when the release was branched, for example 18.01, 18.05
* Per the [security policy](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/SECURITY_POLICY.md), releases within the past 12 months are supported

---
# Releases

* Every release has [release notes](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases)
  * We put substantial effort in making them as useful as we can
  * Highlights, security announcements, deprecation notices, enhancements grouped by impact, etc...
* Every release has its own branch in the `galaxy` GitHub repository
  * Named as `release_YY.MM`
  * Kept up to date (especially for recent releases)

# Deal with local Galaxy modifications

Two scenarios:
1. Uncommitted changes
2. Changes committed to a local branch (or to a fork)

The latter is probably better in case of large changes.

---
# Another possibility

If you want to keep your configurations and other local changes under version control, you can move these files/folders outside of Galaxy and into their own repository. You can then use symbolic links to place the files where Galaxy expects them. A good case for this could be dynamic runners, galaxy.yml files, job_conf.xml, etc.

# Keeping a release up to date (1)

If there are *no local commits*, you can update a `release_YY.MM` branch by running:

```console
$ git stash  # optional, in case of uncommitted modifications
$ git pull --ff-only
$ git stash pop  # optional, as above
```

and restarting Galaxy.

# Keeping a release up to date (2)

In case of changes committed to a local branch:

```console
$ git pull [--rebase] origin release_YY.MM
```

and restart Galaxy.

# Major release upgrade

When you upgrade to a new release:
* Plan a service downtime for the upgrade and inform your users
* Configure your reverse proxy to serve a custom error page, e.g. for nginx inside the `server` section add:
  ```ini
  error_page 502 /static/custom_502.html;
  ```
* When it's time, stop the Galaxy server processes (not the database server!)

# Housekeeping

Not usually necessary, but might help:

```console
$ find . -name '*.pyc' -delete
$ rm -rf database/compiled_templates/*
```

---
# Upgrading the galaxy repo

```console
$ git fetch
$ git stash  # optional
$ git checkout release_YY.MM
$ git pull --ff-only
$ git stash pop  # optional
```

---
# Diff samples

```console
$ git diff release_18.01..release_18.05 -- config/*.sample
```

Merge changes as desired/necessary.

---
# Upgrade virtualenv

```console
$ export GALAXY_CONFIG_FILE=/srv/galaxy/config/galaxy.yml
$ export GALAXY_VIRTUAL_ENV=/srv/galaxy/venv
$ . $GALAXY_VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate
$ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
$ ./scripts/common_startup.sh
$ deactivate
```

# make client on `dev`

Since January 2018, the `dev` and pre-release (frozen) Galaxy branches do not
contain client build artifacts (e.g. JavaScript bundles in `static/`).  For
`dev`, Galaxy will automatically build the client locally, as needed, though if
you need to do so manually (e.g. to include local changes), the following steps
should do it:

1. install `yarn`
2. run `make client-production`

# Tool migrations?

Galaxy source tools -> Tool Shed

We haven't done any in a long time, but may do more.

Galaxy will notify you on the first startup it the upgrade includes migrations.

---
# Database migrations

1. **Backup** your database
   - [PostgreSQL backup docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/backup.html)
2. Run
   ```console
   $ sh manage_db.sh upgrade -c $GALAXY_CONFIG_FILE
   ```

---
# Start Galaxy

* Monitor the log files
* Check `/api/version`
* Check that everything still works

---
# Distribute Galaxy

If you're using a compute cluster and not running from shared file system

# Downgrading

If for some reason you need to move back to an older release, the process is
similar, but the order is a bit different because the database downgrade needs
to be done while being on the newer branch:

```console
$ export GALAXY_CONFIG_FILE=/srv/galaxy/config/galaxy.yml
$ export GALAXY_VIRTUAL_ENV=/srv/galaxy/venv
$ sh manage_db.sh -c /srv/galaxy/config/galaxy.yml downgrade 140
$ find . -name '*.pyc' -delete
$ git fetch
$ git stash  # optional
$ git checkout release_18.01
$ git pull --ff-only
$ git stash pop  # optional
$ ./scripts/common_startup.sh
```

The database version of the release you want to downgrade to (version 135 for
the 18.01 release in the example above) can be found by looking at the last file in:
https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/tree/release_18.01/lib/galaxy/model/migrate/versions/
