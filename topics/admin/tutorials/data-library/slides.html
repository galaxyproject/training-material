title: "Storage Management"
questions:
- How does Galaxy locate data?
- How can I have Galaxy use multiple storage locations?
objectives:
- Setup Galaxy with both the Hierarachical and Distributed Object Storages
key_points:
- The distributed object store configuration allows you to easily expand that storage that is attached to your Galaxy.
- You can move data around without affecting users.

# Data Libraries

- Provide a convenient way to share datasets with users
- Great for commonly used datasets (e.g. reference data, GTN tutorial data)

- Data libraries provide a convenient way for Galaxy administrators to share datasets with users.
- This is ideal for commonly used datasets such as reference data, or data for GTN tutorials.

# Data Libraries

- Access to library datasets:
  - **Shared Data** menu, browse data and import into history
  - Directly from tool form

.pull-left[
.image-50[![data library access from tool form]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/admin/images/data/select-from-lib0.png)]

]

.pull-right[

.image-90[![data library access from tool form]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/admin/images/data/select-from-lib3.png)]

]

???

- Users can browse these data libraries and import datasets directly into their histories.
- Additionally, these datasets can also be selected directly from the tool form.

# Advantages of data libraries

- **Avoid duplication** of data
- Does not count towards user's **quota**
- Libraries can be shared with all users, or specific groups
- **Manage permissions** on library/dataset level using roles and groups.
  - Admins can *create* libraries.
  - Ordinary users can be granted permission to *manage* libraries

???

- Every dataset in the library is stored only once, no matter how many users are using it in their histories.
- The data in data libraries does not count against user quotas.
- Management of libraries can be delegated to users.
- And lastly, libraries can be public, restricted to individuals, or to groups.

# Importing Data

- There are multiple ways to add data to libraries:
  - From history
  - From user directory
  - From import directory (admins only)
  - From remote source

???

- Galaxy provides many options for importing data.
- You can import data from a history, or from disk.
- Importing data on disk is convenient, as Galaxy can recreate the folder structure that is on disk.
- Additionally Galaxy can store library data as a symlink.
- This prevents needing to copy large shared datasets into Galaxy's own data store.

# Configuration

In `galaxy.yml`:

* `user_library_import_dir`
  * Allows authorized non-administrators to upload a directory of files.
  * Directory must contain sub-directories named the same as user's email.
  * Works well in combination with `ftp_upload_dir`.
* `allow_path_paste`
  * Admin-only, allows importing from any path that the Galaxy's user has access to.

???

- If you use old library interface you can also set library_import_dir.
- It specifies which folder admins may browse and import from.
