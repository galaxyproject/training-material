title: "Galaxy Installation with Ansible"
questions:
  - How does it all connect?
  - What steps will we go through?
objectives:
  - Get a high-level overview of a Galaxy server setup
key_points:
  - Everything can be accomplished with Ansible roles from Galaxy
  - You can easily deploy a base Galaxy, or one with more features.

## Install PostgreSQL & Galaxy extensions

![Graph showing a Postgres DB](../../images/ansible-galaxy-intro-0.png)

???

- The first step of a Galaxy deployment is the database.
- This is the foundation of everything.

---

## Install Galaxy & Attach Storage

![Galaxy is now attached to the DB. Gunicorn, storage, and compute are attached to Galaxy](../../images/ansible-galaxy-intro-1.png)

???

- Galaxy is deployed, and attached to the database.
- Next, Gunicorn is setup to run the Galaxy app.
- Storage is attached to Galaxy for storing data.
- And lastly compute is attached to Galaxy and the storage.

---

## Configure NGINX

![NGINX is added to proxy Gunicorn](../../images/ansible-galaxy-intro-2.png)

???

- Next, nginx is attached to UWSGI to proxy connections and speed up access.

---

## Configure Job Handlers

![Job Handlers are added, between Galaxy and the Compute](../../images/ansible-galaxy-intro-3.png)

???

- Job handlers are configured and deployed with the app.
- These connect to the compute and manage jobs.

---

## Install & Configure Slurm

![Slurm is attached to the handlers](../../images/ansible-galaxy-intro-4.png)

???

- Slurm is a much more intelligent resource manager than Galaxy.
- The job handlers are configured to connect to Slurm.
- Slurm deployment is explained in a separate tutorial.

---

## Connect CVMFS & Reference Data

![CVMFS is attached to storage + compute + galaxy](../../images/ansible-galaxy-intro-5.png)

???

- CVMFS is deployed.
- Galaxy is configured to read data from CVMFS.
- Compute is configured to access it as well for jobs that need reference data.

---

## Setup Remote Compute

![Remote compute site, with Pulsar and compute is attached to the job handlers](../../images/ansible-galaxy-intro-6.png)

???

- Lastly, we can scale Galaxy further with remote compute.
- Pulsar connected at a remote site will handle this.

## Major Initial Decisions

* Where to install Galaxy
* Where to store Galaxy datasets
* Database location

???

- These are the major initial decisions you will face.
- Where to install Galaxy, what servers or VMs do you have available?
- Where to store the data?
- Do you have enough space for your users?
- Where to reliably store the database?

---
## Where to install Galaxy

* Must be at same path on cluster - more on this in cluster sessions

???

- Galaxy should be installed somewhere that is available across the cluster.
- We'll cover this in detail in the lesson.

---
## Where to store Galaxy datasets

* Must be at same path on cluster
* Consider future scalability

???

- Where should data be stored?
- Do you have network-attached storage available?
- It must be available to the entire cluster where compute happens.

---
## Database location

* Fast local, reliable storage
* Consider future scalability

???

- The database server should be very reliable.
- It does not need so much disk space, but consider future scalability.

## Basic best practices

* Run as an **unprivileged user**
* When possible, separate *code* from *data* and *configs*
* Write protect code and configs

.left[All of these practices are supported in the [galaxyproject.galaxy][galaxy-role] Ansible role and covered in the [Galaxy Installation with Ansible][ansible-galaxy-tutorial] tutorial!]

[galaxy-role]: https://galaxy.ansible.com/galaxyproject/galaxy
[ansible-galaxy-tutorial]: {% link topics/admin/tutorials/ansible-galaxy/tutorial.md %}

???

- Here are the basic best practices.
- Run without privileges so if someone gains access they are limited in what they can do.
- Ensure the code and configuration are separate.
- If someone manages to act as the galaxy user, this will prevent them from changing galaxy's behaviour.
- All of these best practices are built into the ansible role.
