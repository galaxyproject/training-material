This tutorial assumes you have some familiarity with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/resources/get-started) and are comfortable with writing and running playbooks. Here we'll see how to install a Galaxy server using an Ansible playbook. The Galaxy Project has decided on Ansible for all of its deployment recipes. For our project, Ansible is even more fitting due to its name:

> An ansible is a category of fictional device or technology capable of instantaneous or faster-than-light communication. It can send and receive messages to and from a corresponding device over any distance or obstacle whatsoever with no delay, even between star systems (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible))
{: .quote}

We want to give you a comprehensive understanding of how the Galaxy installation occurs, but we want to avoid you having to write a "custom" Galaxy installation playbook which you would eventually throw away, in order to use the official playbooks. Given these goals, we will go through the playbook in depth first, and then move to a hands-on portion later. If you are not interested in the inner workings, you can [skip to that section now](#installing-galaxy).

# Playbook Overview


## Configuration

We'll be using the [official Galaxy role](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-galaxy) to install and manage Galaxy. This role is found in [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/) (no relation - it is Ansible's system for sharing reusable Ansible roles) as [galaxyproject.galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/galaxyproject/galaxy).

The official role is extremely configurable, everything that you want to change is exposed as a variable, and then tasks will change behaviour based on that. The [role documentation](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-galaxy#role-variables) is the most up-to-date source of documentation for the variables. You should take a minute and read over the variables listed there.

The important variables for this tutorial are:

- `galaxy_root`
- `galaxy_commit_id`
- `galaxy_config`
- `galaxy_server_dir` (automatically set based on `galaxy_root`)

These are largely self explanatory: a directory for all of Galaxy's code and configuration, which commit should be installed, and the Galaxy configuration. We will not explain Galaxy configuration variables in detail as they are covered sufficiently in the `galaxy.yml` sample file or the [online documentation](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/config.html#configuration-options).

The official recommendation is that you should have a variables file such as `group_vars/galaxyservers.yml` for storing all of the Galaxy configuration.

## Tasks

As with every role, the entry point for execution is the `tasks/main.yml` file. [In the case of the galaxyproject.galaxy role](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-galaxy/blob/master/tasks/main.yml), this includes a few groups of important tasks:

- [Clone (or Download) Galaxy](#cloning-galaxy)
- [Managing Configuration](#managing-configuration)
- [Fetching Dependencies](#dependencies)
- [Managing Mutable Setup](#mutable-setup)
- [Managing the Database](#managing-the-database)
- [Building the Client](#building-the-client)

The actions each set of tasks performs are described below.

### Cloning Galaxy

The [clone](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-galaxy/blob/master/tasks/clone.yml) task is the one which is primarily interesting to us, it downloads Galaxy, using git, at a specific commit (or more generally, any [git reference](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References)).

1. Ansible tries to update Galaxy, cloning it if it is missing, or otherwise attempting to update to the correct commit (or latest commit of the given branch).
2. Any change is reported.
3. The virtualenv is set up:
    1. An empty virtualenv is created.
    2. Pip is updated within the virtualenv.
4. Any `.pyc` files are removed, as this can occasionally result in Python loading the cached code, even if the corresponding `.py` file is no longer present at the checked-out commit. For safety, all of these are removed.

With that Galaxy is cloned to disk and is ready to be configured by the next task.

### Managing Configuration

The [static configuration setup](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-galaxy/blob/master/tasks/static_setup.yml) is relatively straightforward:

1. The directories for Galaxy configuration data and for the shed tools are created
2. Any config files are copied over
3. Any templates are copied over
4. The `galaxy.yml` is deployed

The setup for deploying extra Galaxy configuration templates and files is a little bit non-standard by Ansible best practices. Here you are expected to provide your own templates and static config files, and then describe them as a list of files and where they should be deployed to.

Using the [UseGalaxy.eu](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/blob/02ca578211bfee45044facf36635d28208e5dbb3/group_vars/galaxy.yml#L578) configuration as an example, we have something like:


{% raw %}
```yaml
galaxy_config_templates:
  - src: templates/galaxy/config/builds.txt
    dest: "{{ galaxy_config.galaxy.builds_file_path }}"
  - src: templates/galaxy/config/data_manager_conf.xml
    dest: "{{ galaxy_config.galaxy.data_manager_config_file }}"
  - src: templates/galaxy/config/datatypes_conf.xml
    dest: "{{ galaxy_config.galaxy.datatypes_config_file }}"
  - src: templates/galaxy/config/dependency_resolvers_conf.xml
    dest: "{{ galaxy_config.galaxy.dependency_resolvers_config_file }}"
  - src: templates/galaxy/config/disposable_email_blocklist.conf
    dest: "{{ galaxy_config.galaxy.blocklist_file }}"
```
{% endraw %}

The configuration here is a bit different, it references the `galaxy_config`, which is structured like:

{% raw %}
```yaml
galaxy_config:
  galaxy:
    builds_file_path: "{{ galaxy_config_dir  }}/builds.txt"
    datatypes_config_file: "{{ galaxy_config_dir  }}/datatypes_conf.xml"
```
{% endraw %}

So the references in `galaxy_config_templates` to `galaxy_config` are done to ensure that the setting for e.g. "location of the datatypes config file" is the same between where we have configured Galaxy to looking for it, and where the file has been deployed, without requiring us to make variables changes in numerous places.

{% snippet topics/admin/faqs/ansible_define-once.md %}

### Dependencies

Now that Galaxy is available on disk, Ansible is ready to start processing [dependencies](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-galaxy/blob/master/tasks/dependencies.yml) of Galaxy.

1. The virtualenv is updated with data from the `galaxy_requirements_file`, by default pointing to the requirements file in the codebase: {% raw %}`{{ galaxy_server_dir }}/lib/galaxy/dependencies/pinned-requirements.txt`.{% endraw %}
2. Any necessary conditional dependencies of Galaxy are [collected by processing the config file](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/lib/galaxy/dependencies/__init__.py)
3. and then installed to the virtualenv.

### Mutable Setup

[This task](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-galaxy/blob/master/tasks/mutable_setup.yml) creates a directory and initializes "mutable" (written/managed by Galaxy itself) configuration files. It also deploys any hand-managed mutable config files, but it is unlikely that you want to manage these directly, as Galaxy does a sufficient job. Any changes you make to Galaxy, for example installing some tools, would result in the tools being "forgotten about", if you re-ran the playbook and overwrote the `shed_tool_conf.xml` mutable config file with a hand-managed one.

### Managing the Database

The [database management tasks](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-galaxy/blob/master/tasks/database.yml) are extremely convenient; any time you run the playbook to update Galaxy, this will automatically run the database schema migration as needed.

1. The role first obtains the current DB version and the maximum possible DB version based on the codebase.
2. If needed, the database is created.
3. Both versions are reported for the runner of the playbook.
4. If the versions are different, then Ansible runs the command to upgrade the database to the latest version.

As an administrator who often forgot to run the upgrade, and would only notice it once Galaxy crashed during startup, having this process completely automated is extremely nice.

### Building the Client

Galaxy is a modern web application that includes both a server (written in Python) and a client (written in Javascript). After the server is installed and its database prepared, the next step is to build the client application. This means fetching its dependencies, bundling components, creating minified copies of static content, etc. This process ensures that the smallest possible amount of data is transferred to the user when accessing Galaxy over the web, which is important for the performance of the website.

This process can be lengthy and resource intensive. Future plans for Galaxy include pre-building the client so that the build process is not necessary as long as you run "release" versions of Galaxy.

The client lives in the Galaxy code under the [client/](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/client/) directory, and the build process deploys it to the [static/](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/tree/dev/static/) directory, which we will configure a webserver to serve in this tutorial.

## Handlers

A number of the tasks that are executed will trigger a restart of Galaxy. The auto-magic implementation of this restart [handler](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_handlers.html) should work for most cases, but it is possible to define your own custom handlers if necessary. If this is the case for you, the role provides a way to do this by notifying handlers that ["listen"](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_handlers.html#naming-handlers) to certain notifications. See the [role handlers](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-galaxy/tree/main/handlers) for details.

## Defaults

As with other roles, numerous [default values](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-galaxy/blob/master/defaults/main.yml) are provided, but these are useful mostly as reference, and not to go through individually.

## Summary

Installation of Galaxy with the playbook follows generally the steps you would expect:

- Galaxy is cloned (or updated)
- A virtualenv is created if it doesn't exist
- Configuration files are installed
- Any missing dependencies are installed
- Any database updates are applied
- The client application is built and deployed

It would not be difficult to write a role that does this yourself, but by using
the `galaxyproject.galaxy` role, you know that you're getting all of the Galaxy
best practices and knowledge from previous admins codified for you.

# Installing Galaxy

With the necessary background in place, you are ready to install Galaxy with Ansible. The playbooks will start simple, and grow over time. We will start with the minimal Galaxy playbook which only requires setting the `galaxy_root` and expand from there. First, however, we need a database for Galaxy to connect to, so we will do that now.

To proceed from here it is expected that:

> <comment-title>Ubuntu or Debian, CentOS or RHEL?</comment-title>
> The training tutorial is only tested on Ubuntu, as that is the training platform most often used. The training *should* work on RHEL/CentOS, and the roles we use are definitely compatible with both. If any of the variable values differ between Ubuntu and CentOS, we try to note it in the tutorial. Any places we don't note it are bugs.
>
> There are known issues with CentOS7 and python3, which is used in this tutorial. If you use this setup, you should have python2 and python3 coexisting, and use python2 for Ansible (i.e. do not set `interpreter_python` in your `ansible.cfg`) and python3 for Galaxy. This setup requires numerous changes that you will need to discover, which are not covered in this tutorial.
>
> On older versions, both `python-psycopg2` and `python3-psycopg2` may need to be installed.
>
> CentOS8 (and RHEL in general) have significantly different package names for some modules, beware!

> 2. Create the `hosts` inventory file if you have not done so yet, defining a `[galaxyservers]` group with the address of the host where you want to install Galaxy. If you are running Ansible on the same machine where Galaxy will be installed to, you should set the `ansible_connection=local` variable. Lastly, you should explicitly set the `ansible_user` variable to the username to use when connecting to the server. Ansible has changed its behaviour over time regarding whether or not `ansible_user` is defined, and it is most effective to define it explicitly even when it can sometimes be inferred.
>
>    You should also define a `[dbservers]` group for the hosts that will run Galaxy's database. In many cases (and in the case of the Galaxy Admin Training), these will be the same host, but the tutorial is designed to support either scenario, and helps to strengthen understanding of the purpose of host groupings in Ansible for more advanced real-world deployments. Here however we suggest using `[dbservers:children]` and adding `galaxyservers` as the child of that.

We will also set a few variables that must be known by both the Galaxy server and the database server: Galaxy's system/database username, as well as the database name.

## PostgreSQL

Galaxy is capable of talking to multiple databases through SQLAlchemy drivers. SQLite is the development database, but PostgreSQL (/ˈpoʊstɡrɛs ˌkjuː ˈɛl/, POHST-gres kyoo el) is recommended in production. MySQL is a possibility, but does not receive the same testing or bugfixes from the main development team as PostgreSQL, so we will only show installation with PostgreSQL.

PostgreSQL maintains its own user database apart from the system user database. By default, PostgreSQL uses the "peer" authentication method which allows access for system users with matching PostgreSQL usernames (other authentication mechanisms are available, see the [PostgreSQL Client Authentication documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/client-authentication.html).

For this tutorial, we will use the default "peer" authentication, so we need to create a PostgreSQL user matching the system user under which Galaxy will be running, i.e. `galaxy`. This is normally done with the PostgreSQL `createuser` command, and it must be run as the `postgres` user. In our case, we will use the `galaxyproject.postgresql_objects` role to handle this step.

## Galaxy

Next we will dive right in to deploying a copy of Galaxy onto our server.

For a normal Galaxy instance there are a few configuration changes you make very early during deployment:

- Changing the database connection
- Configuring the admin user list

Additionally we'll go ahead and set up the production-ready [Gunicorn + Webless](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/scaling.html#deployment-options) deployment, which separates Galaxy's web and job handling into separate processes. This is done by configuring Galaxy's process manager, [Gravity](https://gravity.readthedocs.io).

Finally, best admin practices are to not run Galaxy as a user with `sudo` access, like your login user probably has. Additionally, it is best to install the Galaxy code and configs as a separate user, for security purposes. So we will instruct the `galaxyproject.galaxy` role to create a new user account specifically to run Galaxy under.

The configuration is quite simple thanks to the many sensible defaults that are provided in the Ansible roles.

> <hands-on-title>Minimal Galaxy Playbook</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Open `galaxy.yml` with your text editor and do the following:
>
>    - Create a new play that will run on the `galaxyservers` group, as the root user (you will need `become`/`become_user`)
>    - Add a pre-task to install the necessary dependencies for the Galaxy server: `acl`, `bzip2`, `git`, `make`, `tar`, `python3-venv`, and `python3-setuptools`
>    - Use the roles `galaxyproject.galaxy` and `galaxyproject.miniconda` (in this order), with `galaxyproject.miniconda` run as the `galaxy` user.

> 3. Again edit the galaxyservers group variables file and add a variable for `galaxy_config`. It will be a hash with one key, `galaxy` which will also be a hash. Inside here you can place all of your Galaxy configuration.

>    1. `admin_users` to the email address you will use with this Galaxy.
>    3. `database_connection` to point to the database you setup earlier (`postgresql:///galaxy?host=/var/run/postgresql`).
>    4. `file_path` to a place to store data, `/data` is fine for this lesson which sets up a single-node Galaxy. If you have separate compute machines, this will normally need to be storage shared between the Galaxy node and compute nodes.
>    5. `tool_data_path` to {% raw %}`{{ galaxy_mutable_data_dir }}/tool-data`{% endraw %}, so that when tools are installed, due to privilege separation, this will happen in a directory Galaxy can actually write into.
>    6. `object_store_store_by` to `uuid`, this is a better way of storing files that will ensure better filesystem balancing than the older system.
>    7. `id_secret` to {% raw %}`{{ vault_id_secret }}`{% endraw %}, we'll define this variable next but it will be used to encode the IDs used in Galaxy URLs and for securing session cookies.

This has a default value, but we will have to override it. Add the following configuration as a child of the `galaxy_config` variable:

Galaxy is now configured with an admin user, a database, and a place to store data. We've immediately configured standalone Galaxy servers to handle jobs and workflow scheduling. Additionally, Galaxy's process manager, Gravity, has written out [systemd](https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) configuration files called *service units* that are used to define how to start and stop Galaxy's various services. Your Galaxy server should now be running!

Usually due to misconfiguration, but occasionally due to other issues like your coworker restarted the server while you were doing maintenance, or network failures, or any other possible error. It happens. An unfortunate side effect can be observed in specific situations:
>
> Let's say you're running a playbook that updates the `galaxy.yml`, which will in turn notify the handler `Restart Galaxy`. If this change is made, and notification triggered, but a failure occurs before Ansible can reach the step where it runs the handlers. The handlers will not run during this Ansible execution.
>
> The next time you run the playbook, Ansible will not observe any configuration files changing (because they were changed in the last run), and so the handler that restarts Galaxy will not run.
>
> If you encounter this situation you just have to be mindful of the fact, and remember to manually run the handler. There is no general solution to this problem unfortunately. This applies mostly to development setups. In production you're probably running that playbook somewhat regularly and do not expect failures as everything is quite stable.

## NGINX

With this we have:

- PostgreSQL running
- Galaxy running (managed by Gravity + systemd)

Although Gunicorn can serve HTTP for us directly, a reverse proxy in front of Gunicorn can automatically compress selected content, and we can easily apply caching headers to specific types of content like CSS or images. It is also necessary if we want to serve multiple sites at once, e.g. with a group website at `/` and Galaxy at `/galaxy`. Lastly, it can provide authentication as well, as noted in the [External Authentication]({{ site.baseurl }}/topics/admin/tutorials/external-auth/tutorial.html) tutorial.

For this, we will use NGINX (pronounced "engine X" /ˌɛndʒɪnˈɛks/ EN-jin-EKS). It is possible to configure Galaxy with Apache and potentially other webservers but this is not the configuration that receives the most testing. We recommend NGINX unless you have a specific need for Apache.

This may seem annoying, but it is often the case that sites have individual needs to cater to, and it is difficult to provide a truly generic webserver configuration. Additionally, we will enable secure communication via HTTPS using SSL/TLS certificates provided by [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).

>    >
>    > - `certbot_auto_renew_hour/minute`: Certbot certificates are short lived, they only last 90 days. As a consequence, automated renewal is a significant part of the setup and well integrated. The certbot role installs a cron job which checks if the certificate needs to be renewed (when it has <30 days of lifetime left) and attempts to renew the certificate as needed. In order to reduce load on the certbot servers, we randomly set the time when the request will be made, so not all of the requests occur simultaneously. For training VMs this will likely never be reached. For real-life machines, this is more important.
>    > - `certbot_auth_method`: [Multiple authentication methods](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html) are supported, we will use the webroot method since that integrates nicely with `galaxyproject.nginx`. This writes out a file onto the webserver's root (that we specify in `certbot_well_known_root`) which certbot's servers will check.
>    > - `certbot_auto_renew`: Automatically attempt renewing the certificate as the `certbot_auto_renew_user`
>    > - `certbot_environment`: The options here are `production` and `staging`, we will set this to staging and obtain a verified but invalid certificate as browsers are intentionally not configured to trust the certbot staging certificates. The staging environment has higher [rate limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/) and allows requesting more certificates during trainings. If you are deploying on a production machine you should set this to `production`.
>    > - `certbot_share_key_users`: This variable automatically shares the certificates with any system users that might need to access them. Here just nginx needs access.
>    > - `certbot_post_renewal`: Often services need to be notified or restarted once the certificates have been updated.
>    > - `certbot_domains`: These are the domains that are requested for verification. Any entries you place here **must** all be publicly resolvable.
>    > - `certbot_agree_tos`: We automatically agree to the certbot TOS. You can read the current one on [their website](https://letsencrypt.org/repository/)

>    > - `nginx_enable_default_server/vhost`: Most Nginx packages come with a default configuration for the webserver. We do not want this.
>    > - `nginx_conf_http`: Here we can write any extra configuration we have, `client_max_body_size: 1g` increases the POST limit to 1Gb which makes uploads easier.

## Log in to Galaxy

Now that your production-ready Galaxy is running, try registering a new user and logging in!

In order to be the administrator user, you will need to register an account with the same email address you used in the group variables under the `admin_users` setting.

## Job Configuration

One of the most important configuration files for a large Galaxy server is the job configuration. This tells Galaxy where to run all of the jobs that users execute. If Galaxy can't find a job conf file or no job configuration has been specified inline in the `galaxy.yml` file, it will use a simple default configuration where all jobs are run on the Galaxy server and are handled by the web serving process, rather than the job handler(s). Galaxy's job running system is highly configurable, the full range of configuration can be found in the sample job configuration file, [`job_conf.sample.yml`](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/release_23.0/lib/galaxy/config/sample/job_conf.sample.yml).

The job configuration allows Galaxy to run jobs in multiple locations using a variety of different mechanisms. Some of these mechanisms include:

* Local - Galaxy runs jobs on the same computer that Galaxy itself is running on.
* DRMAA - Galaxy can connect to a cluster and submit jobs via a distributed resource manager such as Slurm, Condor, PBS Torque or Sun Grid Engine.
* Pulsar - Galaxy can also send jobs to remote compute hosts over the internet using Pulsar.

The job configuration can either be defined inline in the Galaxy configuration under `galaxy_config.galaxy.job_config`, or in its own file, the path to which is specified in `galaxy_config.galaxy.job_config_file`. The syntax of the configuration is the same in both cases.

### The job configuration - basics

The job configuration has three basic sections:

* **runners** - This section lists the types of job management systems that this Galaxy server is configured to use, and tells Galaxy to load the drivers for each type.
* **execution** - This section lists the different attributes such as locations, queues, etc. that Galaxy can send jobs to. Each set of attributes together are called an *environment* (formerly *destination*), has a name, and uses a *plugin* to communicate with that location. They can specify things like the number of CPUs, amount of RAM to be allocated, etc. for DRMAA locations. Usually, one of the destinations is set to be the default.
* **tools** - This section lists the various tools that you would like to send to a non-default *destination*. Each line in this section pairs up a tool in Galaxy with a particular job *destination*. Every time Galaxy gets a job for that particular tool, it is always sent to that *destination*.

A basic job configuration looks like this:

{% raw %}
```yml
runners:
  local_runner:
    load: galaxy.jobs.runners.local:LocalJobRunner
    workers: 4
execution:
  default: local_env
  environments:
    local_env:
      runner: local_runner
      tmp_dir: true
tools:
- id: bwa
  environment: local_env
```
{% endraw %}

The above job configuration defines a *runner* and an *execution* to allow Galaxy to run user jobs on the local computer (i.e. The computer that Galaxy is running on.)

Firstly, the `runners` section contains a plugin called `local_runner` which loads the python code module for supporting local jobs. Next, the `execution` section contains an environment named `local_env` using the runner `local_runner`. It is also set as the default. So now everytime a user clicks "Execute" on a tool form, Galaxy will run the corresponding job locally using the python code specified.

Finally, we have explicitly mapped the tool `bwa` to run in the `local_env` environment. This is more useful once you begin defining additional environments (especially those that run on clusters).

> <tip-title>Want to use something else?</tip-title>
> There are a lot of other plugins available for Galaxy for using other resources such as docker containers, kubernetes clusters, Pulsar servers, and HPC clusters to name a few. See the Galaxy documentation on [job configuration](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/jobs.html) for more details on these plugins and their configuration.

For every other job runner, it means the number of threads that are created to handle Galaxy's internal pre- and post-job tasks. E.g. if you are in a class and 50 people submit jobs, then there are four threads that can handle these jobs at once. But additional job handlers can be more useful as well.

By default, it is set to `false` and if the job uses a temp directory it will create one in the `/tmp/` partition and galaxy will not clean it at the end of the job. This can be problematic if the admin does not do regular cleanup of the `/tmp/` partition or if the `/tmp/` partition is rather small. That's why we recommand to set this option to `true` so the admin does not need to worry about the `/tmp/` partition for galaxy jobs.

We have installed a fairly simple job configuration that does pretty much the same as the default, with one exception: the `handling` section contains an instruction for Galaxy to use the `db-skip-locked` method for assigning which process will handle Galaxy jobs. This causes Galaxy to use the job handler processes we defined earlier in the tutorial to handle jobs, rather than handling them in the (gunicorn) web server process. More details can be found in the [Scaling and Load Balancing](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/scaling.html#job-handler-assignment-methods) section of the Galaxy documentation.

Later tutorials will build on this simple job configuration.

## Productionising Galaxy

This is a fantastic base Galaxy installation but there are numerous additional options we should be setting for a real production Galaxy.

## Disaster Strikes! (Optional)

Because you're an admin, you need to be prepared for any situation, including the worst case scenarios. So we're going to simulate a disaster and show you how you can recover from it. It'll be fun!

For this "disaster", we will pretend that:

1. Your database is on another machine
2. Your datasets are on an NFS server or some other remote machine.

>
> So let's have a "worst case scenario", where your Galaxy server gets destroyed

{: .hands_on}

Your entire Galaxy server is gone! 😱

You were a responsible admin and had your user data and database stored on a separate system (and backed up), so at least those survived. Nevertheless, this is when most of us start feeling really bad; bosses start yelling, we start crying or reaching for bad coping habits.

But not you! You spent the day writing this Ansible playbook that describes your environment completely; all of the software that was installed, all of the configuration changes you have made. It leverages many community maintained roles and can be used to completely rebuild the server! With minimal effort on your part.

{: .hands_on}

And with that, Galaxy should be up and running again. If you log in, you should see the results of any jobs you ran earlier, you should still be able to log in with your old account, and everything should just work.

Ansible can save you from some really bad scenarios, *if and only if*:

- You can replace the hardware or find somewhere new to re-deploy
- You've made absolutely certain that every change made to a system is recorded within your playbooks and roles (i.e. no manual package installation)

Then you can potentially use it to recover.

# Production & Maintenance

The time required to maintain a production Galaxy instance depends on the number of users and their specific needs, but a smallish server (<= 25 users) will typically require a day or two per month of maintenance. Large public servers like usegalaxy.org and usegalaxy.eu are largely full time jobs (although even their admins do find time to do other things).

## Keeping Galaxy Updated

If you have set your `galaxy_commit_id` group variable to a branch name like `release_23.0`, then all you need to do to keep Galaxy up to date (e.g. for security and bug fixes) is to run the playbook regularly. The `git` module in Ansible checks if you are on the latest commit of a given branch, and will update the clone of the repository if it is not.

## Upgrading Galaxy (Optional)

With Ansible, upgrading Galaxy to a new release is incredibly easy. Here is a commit from UseGalaxy.eu's upgrade:

```diff
--- a/group_vars/galaxyservers.yml
+++ b/group_vars/galaxyservers.yml
@@ -345,7 +345,7 @@ galaxy_instance_hostname: usegalaxy.eu

 galaxy_repo: 'https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/galaxy.git'
-galaxy_commit_id: 'release_19.05'
+galaxy_commit_id: 'release_19.09'
 galaxy_force_checkout: true # discard any modified files
```

This is all that is required, changing the `galaxy_commit_id` and re-running the playbook. Everything else (building the client, database migrations, etc.) are taken care of for you.

It is recommend that you also do the following during an upgrade:

- [**Read the release notes**](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/releases/index.html) for the new version of Galaxy
- Check out the latest [`galaxy.yml.sample`](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/master/config/galaxy.yml.sample) for the new release, and see if there are any variables you want to set for your server
- Compare the [other configuration files](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/tree/master/config) to see if there are new features you want to take advantage of (e.g. new job runner options or metrics you wish to capture.)

When you've read the documentation and checked out the new features, you can then run the playbook and you're done!

## User Support

There are many user support resources available to you and your users online. [help.galaxyproject.org](https://help.galaxyproject.org) is the primary landing point for Galaxy users. For helping individual users, you might find it useful to impersonate them if they fail to send adequate bug reports.

### Impersonating

You can activate user impersonation with:

```
allow_user_impersonation: true
```

It is recommended to ask permission or consent before impersonating a user: "Hey, mind if we look at your history?"
Also, since Galaxy is not normally a real-time collaborative activity, you should avoid running jobs in their history, which can confuse users when datasets show up unexpectedly.
Additionally you can automatically send failing job error reports, even if users do not submit one, and maybe proactively address those issues (depending on the number of your users).

## Running on a cluster

If you need to run on a cluster with a shared file system, you will need to expose several directories to your cluster:

- `galaxy_shed_tools_dir`
- `galaxy_tool_dependency_dir`
- `galaxy_file_path`
- `galaxy_job_working_directory`
- `galaxy_server_dir`
- `galaxy_venv_dir`

But this isn't strictly true, not every one of these directories needs to be exported over the network. Instead, there are a couple of those directories that can be recreated in different locations (e.g. locally to nodes) using playbook tasks or simply by copying them to the relevant locations. Sometimes admins choose to do this for performance reasons when NFS can be slow or simply unnecessary:

- `galaxy_server_dir`
- `galaxy_venv_dir`

Both of those directories can be re-created by running parts of the `galaxyproject.galaxy` role on different machines. As neither of these directories is written to during system operations, it is fine for them to be copies living on different machines, rather coming from a single source of truth like an NFS server. For the other directories (e.g. job working directory or tools directory) these need to be written to, and read from, simultaneously from different machines, and should be consistent across the network.

Most of us use NFS, those who are using something more exotic (ceph, gluster, etc) have some reason for that like "my uni provided it" or "we really wanted to try something shiny". But NFS in most cases is decent and well tested and can be used. For larger deployments, a single NFS node may be insufficient, but at these scales it is common that your university or organisation provides some managed NFS service, e.g. Isilon which has load balancing built into its NFS service.

## Other software

But what about your other software, things that are deployed along with Galaxy? Things without an ansible role or are quite weird and require "manual tricks" to deploy?

You can write roles for that! Sometimes they are really ugly roles, but it at least keeps it documented + in place. E.g. UseGalaxy.eu has a custom role for rewriting users and it’s ugly and untested and should not be used by anyone else in case it breaks their site. But it's one of these manual tricks or bits of glue code, but we can encapsulate it as ansible. You can include tarballs in your role to be deployed and so on.

It may seem daunting to use ansible, but you don't have to do everything in ansible! You can just do a little bit, for managing just Galaxy, and manage the rest of your stack separately. Whatever fits best for your deployment.

# Loving Ansible? Convert your own servers!

A common question we get is:

> Is it possible to transform a Galaxy server which was installed by hand, into an ansible-managed one?
{: .quote}

Because of the great variance between sites and deployments it is not really possible to produce a guide for doing so. However, if you back your current deployment up and set all of the variables that control paths appropriately, it can be done!

It's very possible to do this piecemeal, taking one component at a time to ansibilise. nginx is a very easy place to start, the database is as well. Galaxy can be rebuilt in a new location, many of us ran a hand-managed galaxy setup somewhere like `/home/janedoe/work/projects/galaxy` that suddenly became a permanent project, this is a good chance to keep that but rebuild an identical one in `/srv/galaxy` or similar, and then switch over the traffic to that new, production Galaxy. Relocating data is a bit tougher and can require rewriting entries in the database.

# Final Notes

If you've been following along you should have a production-ready Galaxy, secured, everything ready to go.
