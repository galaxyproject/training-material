## Manage Jobs

An admin interface to list current unfinished jobs and finished jobs of a certain age.

* You can stop unfinished jobs
* You can show details of old jobs
* You can lock the server from spawning new jobs. (e.g. for maintenance.)

---

# Log Files

- Galaxy logs (`journalctl -f -u galaxy`)
  - Web (uWSGI)
  - Handler
- nginx logs (`/var/log/nginx/*`)

---

# Analytics

Can we make better walltime decisions?

`scripts/runtime_stats.py`: Database-driven job runtime statistics

---

# Reports

Galaxy ships with its own app that reports usage (user, job, data, etc numbers)

---
# Nagios

[Nagios](https://www.nagios.com/) is a general-purpose tool for monitoring systems and services.

Galaxy-specific check in `contrib/nagios/`: Runs Galaxy jobs

---

# Sentry

* Motto: *"Stop hoping your users will report errors"*
* Error tracking and analysing tool.
* Galaxy has Sentry middleware that you can enable in configuration.

---
# Job Metrics

Galaxy can collect metrics on each job through configurable plugins in `job_metrics_conf.xml`.

Some plugins:
- `core`: Captures Galaxy slots, start and end of job, runtime
- `cpuinfo`: processor count for each job
- `env`: dump environment for each job
- `collectl`: monitor a wide array of system performance data

# Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana

General purpose tools for monitoring systems and services.

Tool     | Use
---      | ---
[Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) | plugin-driven server agent for collecting & reporting metrics
[Influxdb](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/) | purpose built time series database
[Grafana](https://grafana.com/)  | dashboard for beautiful analytics and monitoring

Dataflow:

- Galaxy produces data
- Telegraf consumes and buffers it, before sending it to
- InfluxDB which stores the data
- And Grafana is used to visualise it

---
# Infrastructure for Grafana

* Everything captured in Galaxy Ansible [infrastructure-playbook](https://github.com/galaxyproject/infrastructure-playbook/) repository.
* Ansible [playbook](https://github.com/dj-wasabi/ansible-telegraf) to install Telegraf.
* Ansible [tasks](https://github.com/galaxyproject/infrastructure-playbook/blob/master/roles/stats/tasks/redhat.yml) for installing InfluxDB and Grafana.

---
# Grafana showcase

* usegalaxy.eu [public server](https://stats.usegalaxy.eu)
* usegalaxy.org.au [public server](https://stats.genome.edu.au)
* usegalaxy.org private server

If you see a dashboard you can export its configuration and put it on your Grafana with your data. Copy away!
