title: "Server Maintenance and Backups"
zenodo_link: ""
questions:
  - How do I maintain a Galaxy server?
  - What happens if I lose everything?
objectives:
  - Learn about different maintenance steps
  - Learn what to back up and how to recover
time_estimation: "30m"
key_points:
  - Use configuration management (e.g. Ansible)
  - Store configuration management in git
  - Back up the parts of Galaxy that can't be recreated

# Server Maintenance

## Dataset Cleanup

Can only delete (or purge) dataset when all 'associations' pointing at it have been marked `deleted`.

| method | description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py` | PostgreSQL-optimized fast cleanup script |
| `scripts/cleanup_datasets/cleanup_datasets.py` | General cleanup script |
| `gxadmin cleanup <days>` | calls pgcleanup |

## pgcleanup invocation

```console
$ ./scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py --help
usage: pgcleanup.py [-h] [-c CONFIG_FILE] [-d] [--dry-run] [--force-retry]
                    [-o DAYS] [-U] [-s SEQUENCE] [-w WORK_MEM] [-l LOG_DIR]
                    [ACTION [ACTION ...]]

positional arguments:
  ACTION                Action(s) to perform, chosen from: delete_datasets,
                        delete_exported_histories, delete_inactive_users,
                        delete_userless_histories, purge_datasets,
                        purge_deleted_hdas, purge_deleted_histories,
                        purge_deleted_users, purge_error_hdas,
                        purge_hdas_of_purged_histories,
                        purge_historyless_hdas, update_hda_purged_flag

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config-file CONFIG_FILE, --config CONFIG_FILE
                        Galaxy config file (defaults to
                        $GALAXY_ROOT/config/galaxy.yml if that file exists or
                        else to ./config/galaxy.ini if that exists). If this
                        isn't set on the command line it can be set with the
                        environment variable GALAXY_CONFIG_FILE.
  -d, --debug           Enable debug logging (SQL queries)
  --dry-run             Dry run (rollback all transactions)
  --force-retry         Retry file removals (on applicable actions)
  -o DAYS, --older-than DAYS
                        Only perform action(s) on objects that have not been
                        updated since the specified number of days
  -U, --no-update-time  Don't set update_time on updated objects
  -s SEQUENCE, --sequence SEQUENCE
                        DEPRECATED: Comma-separated sequence of actions
  -w WORK_MEM, --work-mem WORK_MEM
                        Set PostgreSQL work_mem for this connection
  -l LOG_DIR, --log-dir LOG_DIR
                        Log file directory
```

# Additional cleaning scripts

* `admin_cleanup_datasets.py`
  * Mark datasets as deleted that are older than specified cutoff.
  * Has email templated notification (can also be used to just send info without deleting).
  * Can be restricted to a tool.

## Other disk space cleanups

- `tmpwatch` (`tmpreaper` on Debian-based distros) your job working directory
  - `cleanup_job` in `galaxy.yml` (defaults to `always` though)
- `tmpwatch` your `new_file_path`
  - `/usr/bin/tmpwatch -v --mtime --dirmtime 7d /srv/galaxy/var/tmp`

# Backups

---
class: left

## What to backup

**Must** be backed up:

| item | path (from tutorials) |
| ---- | ---- |
| Database ([PITR][postgresql-pitr], enable in [galaxyproject.postgresql][ansible-postgresql]) | system dependent |
| Installed shed tools | `/srv/galaxy/var/shed_tools` |
| *Managed* (aka *mutable*) configs | `/srv/galaxy/var/config` |
| Logs (if you like...) | `systemd-journald` |
| Datasets (if you can...) | `/data` |

If absolute reproducibility matters:

| item | path (from tutorials) |
| ---- | ---- |
| Tool dependencies | `/srv/galaxy/var/dependencies` |
| Data manager-installed reference data | `/srv/galaxy/var/tool-data` |

---
class: left

## What not to back up

Restorable from Ansible Playbook:

| item | path (from tutorials) |
| ---- | ---- |
| Galaxy | `/srv/galaxy/server` |
| Virtualenv | `/srv/galaxy/venv` |
| *Static* configs | `/srv/galaxy/config` |

Recreatable at runtime:

| item | path (from tutorials) |
| ---- | ---- |
| Anything in *managed/mutable data dir* not previously mentioned | `/srv/galaxy/var` |
| Job working directories | `/srv/galaxy/jobs` |

## Restoring from backups

If lost *database* or *managed/mutable configs*, then **restore these first**

Then run playbook
