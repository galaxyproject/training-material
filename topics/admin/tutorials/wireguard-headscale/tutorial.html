<h1 id="what-is-tailscale">What is Tailscale?</h1>

<p>It’s like Wireguard but easier and they built a <strong>lot</strong> of nice features on top of it. It’s networking that “Just Works™” even more than Wireguard. If you prefer to use plain Wireguard without Headscale/Tailscale, or just want to get an understanding of the technology that Headscale/Tailscale build off of, <a href="/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/wireguard/tutorial.html">there is a tutorial for that</a> as well.</p>

<h2 id="is-it-right-for-me">Is it right for me?</h2>

<p>if you have machines that need to talk to each other privately, and you don’t
have a better way to do it like a local network team, then yes, it’s a great
solution to private, secure, fast networking. if you need auditing, tailscale
will do that, rather than you having to build it out yourself.
it has <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/performance/">excellent performance</a>
despite the encryption, and is built directly into the kernel.</p>

<p>By using wireguard, you can let services listen only on the wireguard
interface, and thus only known and trusted machines can access those services.</p>

<p>Tailscale makes wireguard setup even easier by removing the key management
step, which normally requires distributing keys to every machine. Instead that
step is handled centrally, and in the case of Tailscale enforceable with ACLs
and SSO and 2FA policies, however the networking remains meshed, and machines
connect directly to one another.</p>

<p>You can go one step further than trusting individual machines, with Tailscale,
as every device is tied to a single user, and you can ask Tailscale what is the
authenticated identity of the specific TCP connection, allowing automatically
logging in your users.</p>

<p>In the context of Galaxy, this can be useful for components like <a href="/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/interactive-tools/tutorial.html">Interactive 
Tools</a>, which 
require a web proxy between Galaxy and the cluster node where the tool runs. If 
the cluster is not on the local network, Wireguard can be used to securely 
bridge the gap, and Headscale or Tailscale can greatly simplify that process.</p>

    <p>Tailscale has implemented the coordination server and infrastructure with much better, more robust infrastructure that you won’t have to be responsible for. If you can get your institution to pay for it, or grant money covering it, it’s <strong>probably worth it</strong>. They add many new features often, and things like the mobile apps only work with their service. Tailscale is free for personal use (i.e. to test things out) and offers a free plan for open source projects that you may qualify for.</p>

    <p>For a training event obviously we want something free and quick to setup and destroy, so, we’re using <a href="https://github.com/juanfont/headscale">Headscale</a> since it’s free and we’re just going to destroy it immediately, and no one will accidentally get billed ;)</p>

    <p>Using Headscale will also teach you everything you need to know if you do choose to use Tailscale, which is simpler and has fewer components for you to manage yourself.</p>
