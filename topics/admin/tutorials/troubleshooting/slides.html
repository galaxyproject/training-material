Use Ansible! This is permanently solved for you.

Otherwise, upgrade as instructed.

.left[If you believe this message is in error, you can:]
- Check DB table `migrate_version`, column `version`.
- Check folder `lib/galaxy/model/migrate/versions/` - the latest migration should match the DB.
- Clean the `*.pyc` files in migrate versions folder to make sure there is no remnant from other code revisions.
  - See [makepyc.py in galaxyproject.galaxy](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-galaxy/blob/master/files/makepyc.py).

---
# Stuck in a restart loop

The reason that Galaxy is dying might not be in the log. If it's not, then

If using **systemd** then it should be in `journalctl -u galaxy`

If using something else, it's wherever `stderr` is being redirected to (supervisor?)

Or maybe the system is killing it... (`/var/log/{messages,syslog}`)

# Web/UI Problems

--

## LOGS

Specifically: uWSGI, nginx, and browser console logs

---
# 502 Bad Gateway

Your reverse proxy has failed to connect to the Galaxy socket

- Check that Galaxy is running / not in a reboot loop
- Check that your proxy and Galaxy/uWSGI socket options match
- Check proxy server logs (e.g. `/var/log/nginx`)
- Check uWSGI logs for `bind(): Address already in use [core/socket.c line 769]`
- Check that something is listening on the correct port (`sudo ss -tlpn 'sport = :port'` (demo!) or `sudo lsof -i :port` (demo!))
  - If it's uWSGI, make sure it's not an old one!

---
# 504 Gateway Timeout

Or timeout messages in the Galaxy UI

In uWSGI logs:
```
*** uWSGI listen queue of socket &quot;0.0.0.0:8080&quot; (fd: 6) full !!! (101/100) ***
*** uWSGI listen queue of socket &quot;0.0.0.0:8080&quot; (fd: 6) full !!! (101/100) ***

*** uWSGI listen queue of socket &quot;0.0.0.0:8080&quot; (fd: 6) full !!! (101/100) ***
```

Galaxy is not processing requests in a timely manner

---
# 504 Gateway Timeout

Use `uwsgitop` (demo!)

- `uwsgitop` state busy?

```console

Kernel uninterruptable sleep. Probably IO. Check filesystems, disks.

Restart Galaxy

# 504 Gateway Timeout or slow UI

Check load

```console

# Galaxy UI is slow

- [Tutorial from @mvdbeek](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/dev/finding_and_improving_slow_code.html#profiling)
- Use Galaxy [heartbeat](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/8c2066f07ac7bb48c59cf8378e5a852e6fb82a4e/config/galaxy.yml.sample#L1036) (demo!)
- Use `py-spy`

---
# Blank page or no CSS/JavaScript

Serving of static content is broken.

- Check browser console for 404 errors.
- Check proxy error log for permission errors.
- Verify that your proxy static configuration is correct.
- If you have recently upgraded Galaxy or changed the GUI in some way, you will need to rebuild the client

---
# Tool failures

Tools can fail for a variety of reasons, some valid, some invalid.

Some made up examples follow.

---
# Tool missing from Galaxy

- Restart Galaxy and watch the log for
```console
Loaded tool id: toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/sickle/sickle/1.33, version: 1.33 into tool panel....
```

- After startup, check `integrated_tool_panel.xml` for
```xml
&lt;tool id=&quot;toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/sickle/sickle/1.33&quot; /&gt;
```

- If it is TS tool check `shed_tool_conf.xml` for
```xml
&lt;tool file=&quot;toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/sickle/43e081d32f90/sickle/sickle.xml&quot; guid=&quot;toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/sickle/sickle/1.33&quot;&gt;
...
&lt;/tool&gt;
```

- Multiple job handlers? Sometimes they don't all get the update.

---
# Tool errors

Tool stdout/stderr is available in UI under &quot;i&quot; icon on history dataset

.left[Debugging on the filesystem:]
1. Set `cleanup_job` to `onsuccess`
2. Cause a job failure
3. Go to job working directory (find in logs or `/srv/galaxy/jobs/&lt;hash&gt;/&lt;job_id&gt;`)
4. Poke around, try running things (`srun --pty bash` considered useful)

Familiarize yourself with the places Galaxy keeps things (demo?)

---
# Tool errors - stderr

**Galaxy considers *any* output to standard error (stderr) to be an error when no tool profile version is set by a tool.**

Why would it do this????!?!!!11

In the old days, tools were bad about setting the exit code on failure, so it could not be trusted. Galaxy had no functionality to inspect output to decide on failure.

---
class: left
# Tool errors

So what if tool stderr contains:
```console
Congratulations, running SuperAwesome tool was successful!
```

What happens: job fails (!!?!?)

Solutions:
- If the wrapped tool uses proper exit codes, use `&lt;tool profile=&quot;16.04&quot;&gt;` or later to ignore stderr
- Using current tool development best practices ensures this is the case

---
class: left
# Tool errors

Tool output contains:
```console
Warning: Discarded 10000 lines of /input/dataset_1.dat because they looked funny
```

Maybe a problem, maybe not.

Solutions:
- Check tool input(s) and parameters (maybe requires some biological knowledge)
- Verify input is not corrupt
- User education

---
class: left
# Tool errors - memory errors

Tool output contains one of:
```console
MemoryError                 # Python
what():  std::bad_alloc     # C++
Segmentation Fault          # C - but could be other problems too
Killed                      # Linux OOM Killer
```

Solutions:
- Change input sizes or params
  - Map/reduce?
- Decrease the amount of memory the tool needs
- Increase the amount of memory available to the job
  - Request more memory from cluster scheduler
  - Use job resubmission to automatically rerun with a larger memory allocation
- Cross your fingers and rerun the job

---
class: left
# Tool errors - system errors

Tool output contains:
```console
open(): /input/dataset_1.dat: No such file or directory
```

Solutions:
- Verify that `/input/dataset_1.dat` exists.
  - On node the job ran on
  - As the user the job ran as
- Fix the filesystem error (NFS?) and rerun the job
- See NFS caching errors slide later

---
class: left
# Tool errors - dependency problems

Tool output contains:
```console
sh: command not found: samtools
```

Solutions:
- Verify that `tool_dependency_dir` is accessible *on the cluster, as the user running Galaxy jobs*
- Verify that tool dependencies are properly installed: Galaxy UI &quot;Admin &gt; Manage dependencies&quot;
- Use BioContainers (Docker/Singularity)

---
# Manage Dependencies

An incredibly useful feature to hit unruly tool dependencies with a large hammer.

![Manage Dependencies](../../images/troubleshooting/manage-dependencies.png &quot;Manage Dependencies&quot;)

--

(demo!)

---
# An aside - dependency problems on geriatric Galaxies

Galaxy Tool Shed dependencies are dead.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; If you don't know what Tool Shed dependencies are (lucky you) skip this slide.

Don't attempt to fix Galaxy Tool Shed dependencies, just update tool and reinstall with Conda.

Put Conda first in [dependency_resolvers_conf.xml](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/config/dependency_resolvers_conf.xml.sample) if you still need to support both.

.reduce70[.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The Tool Shed should only be used for Galaxy Tool configuration files and wrapper scripts]]

---
class: left
# Tool errors - dependency problems

Tool output contains:
```console
foo: error while loading shared libraries: libdeepthought.so.42: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

`foo` was compiled against `libdeepthought.so.42` but it's not on the runtime linker path

Solutions:
- Reinstall tool dependencies (&quot;Admin &gt; Manage dependencies&quot;). If it still fails&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:
  - Determine conda package providing `libdeepthought.so`
  - Downgrade it to the version that provides `libdeepthought.so.42`
- Use BioContainers (Docker/Singularity)

.center[.reduce70[.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; First, Google the error because someone named Björn has probably already found and fixed the problem.]]]

???
Galaxy ensures that the correct version(s) of tool(s) immediate dependencies are controlled, but dependencies of dependencies are up to conda. Occasionally, upgrades to these second level dependencies break existing conda packages, requiring package authors to update the first level dependencies to correct the issue.

---
class: left
# Tool errors - Empty green history item

1. The tool is not correctly detecting error conditions: inspect stdout/stderr
2. The tool correctly produced an empty dataset for the given params, inputs

Solutions:
- Fix the tool wrapper to detect errors
- User education

---
# Summary of types of tool failures

- Input/parameter problem (user or tool wrapper author problem)
- Tool wrapper bug (tool wrapper author problem)
- Tool bug (tool wrapper author or tool developer problem)
- Resource problem (sysadmin problem)

--

Everything else: always the sysadmin's problem

---
# One last word on tool errors

All IUC/devteam tools in the Tool Shed have tests

Use these tests (automateable with [Ephemeris](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ephemeris)!) to verify that the tool works in the basic case

```

- Job is assigned **Galaxy** job ID 21
- &quot;Executed&quot; is misleading - the Job has been created in the `job` table of the database, but is not picked up by a job handler yet.
- All of this has occurred in the web worker.
- If not using mules and &quot;Executed&quot; is the last message you see, verify job assigned to a valid handler.

# Jobs aren't running

![Job in new state](../../images/troubleshooting/hda-new.png &quot;Job in new state&quot;)

Corresponds to `job.state = 'new'` in database

Not yet picked up by the Galaxy job handler subsystem

Troubleshooting depends on your job handler configuration

---

Solutions:
- If using single process or mules
  - Ensure no `&lt;handlers&gt;` in `job_conf.xml`
  - Check handler logs
- If using `assign_with=&quot;db-skip-locked&quot;`
  - Ensure no `default` attribute in `&lt;handlers&gt;`
  - Ensure no individual `&lt;handler&gt;`s defined
  - Ensure `handler` column of `job` table is being set to `_default_`
  - Ensure handlers started with `--attach-to-pool=job-handlers`
- If using `assign_with=&quot;db-preassign&quot;`
  - Ensure that handler ID(s) in `job_conf.xml` match `server_name`(s)
  - Ensure `handler` column of `job` table is being set to valid handler ID

# Handler ID to server_name match check

Job handler assignment check:

```gxadmin
$ grep ' is running$' /path/to/galaxy*.log
galaxy.web.stack INFO 2019-01-31 15:18:35,228 [MainThread] Galaxy server instance 'handler0' is running
galaxy.web.stack INFO 2019-01-31 15:18:35,228 [MainThread] Galaxy server instance 'handler1' is running
$ gxadmin query job-info 21
```
.reduce70[
id  | tool_id | state |    handler        | username |        create_time         | job_runner_name | job_runner_external_id
--- | ------- | ----- | ----------------- | -------- | -------------------------- | --------------- | -----------------------
21  | testing | new   | **job_handler_0** | admin    | 2019-02-01 14:30:20.540327 |                 |
]

The correct value of the `handler` column in the database varies by job handler assignment method (`&lt;handlers assign_with=...&gt;`):
- mules: `null` (empty) then `main.job-handlers.&lt;mule_id&gt;` after assignment
- db-skip-locked: `_default_` then `handlerN` (where `handlerN` is the value of one of your handlers' `--server-name`)
- db-preassign: `handlerN`

In this case, `job_handler_0` is not `handler0` or `handler1` (probably due to a misconfiguration in `&lt;handlers&gt;` section of `job_conf.xml`), so no handler will find this job.

---
# An aside - unruly log files

By default, Galaxy web workers and mules all log to a single file. See [advanced logging configuration](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/config_logging.html) to split mules in to their own files.

tl;dr: add [the second blob 'o YAML here](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/admin/config_logging.html#yaml) to your `galaxy.yml`. Most importantly:

```yaml
filename_template: galaxy_{pool_name}_{server_id}.log
```

Galaxy subtitutes `{pool_name}` with e.g. `job-handlers` and `{server_id}` with e.g. `1`. Full list of template vars in the docs.

---
# Jobs aren't running

![Job in queued state](../../images/troubleshooting/hda-queued.png &quot;Job in queued state&quot;)

Corresponds to `job.state = 'queued'` in database

A handler has seen this job

.left[Verify concurrency limits unmet in `job_conf.xml`:]
- Local jobs: value of plugin `workers` attribute (default: 4)
- All jobs: Entire `&lt;limits&gt;` section

Users are *not* informed when they have reached the job limits. Exceeding disk quota also pauses jobs, but users are notified of this.

---
# Jobs aren't running

.left[Check database for:]
- Destination ID (`gxadmin query job-info`)
- Job runner external (DRM) ID (`gxadmin query job-info`)
- Jobs owned by user in non-terminal state if limits in use (`gxadmin query jobs-nonterminal [user]`)
- Check handler **logs**

If external ID is assigned, job is queued on a cluster. Use cluster queue status tool(s) to investigate further.

---
# Jobs aren't finishing

![Job in running state](../../images/troubleshooting/hda-running.png &quot;Job in running state&quot;)

Corresponds to `job.state = 'running'` in database

Get job runner external (DRM) ID (`gxadmin query job-info`), use cluster queue status tool(s) to investigate further.

.left[If the DRM job is finished but the Galaxy job is still &quot;running&quot;:]
- Check last job handler log message for job
- Setting/collecting metadata can be slow: wait
- Check handlers health (`py-spy` or `gdb` (demos later!))

Note if you're not using our default/suggested uWSGI config, `SIGINT` (`CTRL`+`c`) and `SIGTERM` (the `kill(1)` default) behave differently.

- `SIGKILL`: Brutally reload the application
- `SIGINT`: Brutally kill the application

Our default/suggested uWSGI config includes:

```yaml
hook-master-start: unix_signal:2 gracefully_kill_them_all
hook-master-start: unix_signal:15 gracefully_kill_them_all
```

This attempts to shut down gracefully, waiting for (by default) 60 seconds before killing.

To alter the grace period, set the [*reload-mercy options](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Options.html).

# Database problems

Slow queries, high load, etc.

- Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` (demo!)
  - [Example of the &quot;jobs ready to run&quot; query](https://gist.github.com/natefoo/da46bea8136ba67d65f616c86a27c454)
  - `database_engine_option_echo` (but warning, extremely verbose)
  - `slow_query_log_threshold` logs to Galaxy log file
  - `sentry_sloreq_threshold` if using Sentry
  - [Postgres EXPLAIN Visualizer (PEV)](https://tatiyants.com/pev/#/plans) considered useful ([demo data](https://gist.github.com/hexylena/467c7726b5ab9e18c47080893dbc072e))
- Use `VACUUM ANALYZE`
- `gxadmin query pg-*` commands

Increase `shared_buffers`. 2GB on Main (16GB of memory on VM)

# error: [Errno 32] Broken pipe

This error is not indicative of any kind of failure. It just means that the client closed a connection before the server finished sending a response.

---
# Installation failures - Python dependencies

```
psutil/_psutil_linux.c:12:20: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1
```

Find `Python.h` on [packages.ubuntu.com](http://packages.ubuntu.com/) and install that package (hint: development package for Python 3)

# Other stuff

- Galaxy server process (not jobs): Run Galaxy in a cgroup with a memory limit
- You can add mules without a hard restart: add `mule:`, adjust `farm:`, run `pkill -HUP -o -u galaxy uwsgi`
- `scripts/helper.py` and `scripts/secret_decoder_ring.py` can encode/decode IDs from UI
- `scripts/helper.py` can also fail jobs with a notice to the user

---
# Job failures

&quot;Unable to run job due to a misconfiguration of the Galaxy job running system.  Please contact a site administrator.&quot;

There is a traceback in the Galaxy log. Go find it.

# Node failures

```console
$ sinfo -Nel
Fri Nov 11 09:50:01 2016
NODELIST   NODES PARTITION       STATE CPUS    S:C:T MEMORY TMP_DISK WEIGHT FEATURES REASON
localhost      1    debug*        down    2    2:1:1      1        0      1   (null) Node unexpectedly rebooted
```

Figure out why it rebooted and:

```console
$ sudo scontrol update nodename=localhost state=resume
```

---
# User over quota

Instruct user (or use impersonate with consent) to check for *deleted* but not *purged* histories

In the Admin/Users menu you can run `Recalculate Disk Usage` on a certain user

There is also a command line version: `scripts/set_user_disk_usage.py`
