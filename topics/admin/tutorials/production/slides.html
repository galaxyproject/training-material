# Securing your Object IDs

* User facing object IDs
  * Galaxy uses the Blowfish cipher to obscure integer IDs.
  * Prevents guessing the hashes for various Galaxy objects.
  * `id_secret` is used as the Blowfish key.
  * Changing the default `id_secret` is a must.
  * Changing `id_secret` will change & invalidate existing URLs (e.g. datasets, histories, workflows, etc).
