# Production server

* Used by multiple people
* Designed to be resilient, scalable
* Designed to be easily managed

???

- A production server is a server ready for any number of users.
- It is designed to be scalable, easy to manage, and resilient in the face of many users.
- Running a production server is not difficult, thanks to ansible.

---

# Configuration Options

???

- We will now cover many of the configuration options which are necessary for production.

# Configuring uWSGI

Important options in the `uwsgi` section of `galaxy.yml`

option | description
---- | ----
`http` | port and IP on which to listen for HTTP requests, `:8080` for port `8080` on all network interfaces. **For a production server, you should use `socket:` and a proxy server**.
`socket` | port and IP on which to listen for uWSGI protocol requests, `127.0.0.1:8000` for port `8000` on localhost.
`processes` | number of uWSGI *web workers*.
`threads` | number of threads for each web worker.
`offload-threads` | number of threads for internal routing requests, 1-2 is sufficient.
`master` | use uWSGI master process manager, defaults to `false` for dev compatibility but should be `true` in production.
`mule-reload-mercy` | time to gracefully wait for mule shutdown, set > `monitor_thread_join_timeout` galaxy option.

???

- Production servers should use socket instead of http in the uwsgi listen section.
- This is because socket means using the uwsgi protocol which is more efficient.
- Processes and threads can be set, but the defaults are usually good.

# Securing your Object IDs

* User facing object IDs
  * Galaxy uses the Blowfish cipher to obscure integer IDs.
  * Prevents guessing the hashes for various Galaxy objects.
  * `id_secret` is used as the Blowfish key.
  * Changing the default `id_secret` is a must.
  * Changing `id_secret` will change & invalidate existing URLs (e.g. datasets, histories, workflows, etc).
* Setting `new_user_dataset_access_role_default_private` ensures that even guessable IDs are still private

???

- An extremely important setting to change is the id secret.
- Galaxy generates a reversible hash for every numeric ID.
- You must change this, or an attacker can guess IDs and see potentially private data.
- There is an additional variable, new user dataset access role default private, which can be set.
- Then, even if IDs are guessed, the data remains private.

# Customizing your "Brand"

option | description
---- | ----
`brand` | appends "/{brand}" to the "Galaxy" text in the masthead.
`logo_url` | URL linked by the "Galaxy/brand" text.
`helpsite_url` | URL linked by the "Galaxy Help" link in the "Help" menu.
`wiki_url` | URL linked by the "Wiki" link in the "Help" menu.
`support_url` | URL linked by the "Support" link in the "Help" menu.
`citation_url` | URL linked by the "How to Cite Galaxy" link in the "Help" menu.
`search_url` | URL linked by the "Search" link in the "Help" menu.
`mailing_lists_url` | URL linked by the "Mailing Lists" link in the "Help" menu.
`screencasts_url` | URL linked by the "Videos" link in the "Help" menu.
`terms_url` | URL linked by the "Terms and Conditions" link on the registration form.
`qa_url` | URL linked by the "Galaxy Q&A" link in the "Help" menu.

???

- Brand can be set to denote the identity of your server.
- Many URLs which appear in the top menu can be modified.

---
# Adding a Notice Banner

option | sample value
---- | ----
`message_box_visible` | `true`
`message_box_content` | `Downtime scheduled Sunday at Noon to one.`
`message_box_class` | `warning` (also: `error`, `info`)

???

- Sometimes you wish to broadcast a message to your users, for example when you plan downtime.
- The message box allows doing this.

---
# Update the welcome page

Welcome page is `$GALAXY_ROOT/static/welcome.html` and is the first thing that
users see. It is a good idea to extend it with things like:
- Server or Group News
- Downtimes/Maintenance periods
- New tools
- Publications relating to your Galaxy
- Current server usage / jobs running (e.g. https://usegalaxy.eu/)

.left[No restarting is necessary.]

???

- Updating the welcome page is important as all users see this page when accessing the server.
- This can be a great way to communicate lower-priority information to users.
- The European Galaxy server uses it to show usage graphs which users like.

# Client Browser Security

option | description
---- | ----
`sanitize_all_html` | by default, Galaxy sanitizes all "text/html" tool outputs. Setting to false potentially exposes users to XSS attacks.
`sanitize_whitelist_file` | manually override html sanitization for listed tools. Can set in admin interface.
`serve_xss_vulnerable_mimetypes` | certain filetypes (e.g. SVG) can contain JS that is vulnerable to XSS (Cross-site scripting) and are served as "plain/text" by default.
`allowed_origin_hostnames` | Returns Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header that matches the Origin header of the request.


???

- Some tools produce HTML or SVG outputs.
- By default, galaxy sanitizes these files, as malicious ones could be used to attack users.
- If there are some tools you trust like fastqc, you might want to whitelist them.

---
# Debugging

These should never be enabled on a public site.

option | description
---- | ----
`debug` | enable debug options, preserves cluster job data on disk (but use `cleanup_job` for this).
`use_profile` | Python profiler on requests.
`use_printdebug` | Anything "print"ed within a Galaxy Web thread is exposed to user.
`use_interactive` | Enable live debugging in your browser.

???

- There are debugging options if you need, but none of these should be enabled in production.


---
# Configuring FTP

option | description
---- | ----
`ftp_upload_dir` | Directory containing subdirectories matching users' identifier (defaults to e-mail).
`ftp_upload_site` | Hostname of your FTP server provided to users in the help text. Must set to enable FTP import.
`ftp_upload_dir_identifier` | User attribute for subdirectory naming. 'email' (${user.email}) is default, but 'id' or 'username' are also common.
`ftp_upload_dir_template` | Python string template used to determine a users FTP upload directory (${ftp_upload_dir}/${ftp_upload_dir_identifier}).
`ftp_upload_purge` | Delete files after FTP import (true).

???

- A common request is how should users upload large datasets.
- If you setup an FTP server, this can be integrated with Galaxy.
- Users can see their own FTP upload directory in Galaxy, if you configure it.

# Configuring Data Library Path Uploads

Admin options

option | description
---- | ----
`library_import_dir` | Browse and upload files from configured directory.
`allow_path_paste` | Allow admins to paste any path to upload (e.g. `file://`), applies also to the general 'upload tool'.

User options

option | description
---- | ----
`user_library_import_dir` | Root directory containing sub-directories named by user emails. A nifty setup is that the value is the same as for `ftp_upload_dir` allowing users to upload files via FTP and then import them either in history or data library.
`user_library_import_dir_auto_creation` | Create user's folder upon login.
`user_library_import_symlink_whitelist` | Directories that users are allowed to symlink to.
`user_library_import_check_permissions` | If Galaxy usernames match system usernames enable this to use UNIX permissions.

???

- Library management is a common problem for servers.
- How to manage the data and who can manage the data.
- There are several options in galaxy yml to allow users to manage libraries.

# Configuring SMTP

SMTP server

option | description
---- | ----
`smtp_server` | host:port of SMTP server to use. Uses STARTTLS, but will fallback.
`smtp_username` | Username for SMTP server.
`smtp_password` | Password for SMTP server. STARTTLS recommended on SMTP server.
`smtp_ssl` | If SMTP server requires SSL from connection start, set to true.

- Emails can be sent to users if they forget their passwords.
- You can require email validation to ensure users provide valid emails.
