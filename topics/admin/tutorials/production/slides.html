# Production server

* Used by multiple people
* Designed to be resilient, scalable
* Designed to be easily managed

---
# Major initial decisions

* Where to install Galaxy
* Where to store Galaxy datasets
* Database location

---
# Where to install Galaxy

* Must be at same path on cluster - more on this in cluster sessions

---
# Where to store Galaxy datasets

* Must be at same path on cluster
* Consider future scalability

---
# Basic Best practices

* Run as an **unprivileged user**
* When possible, separate *code* from *data* and *configs*
* Write protect code and configs

---
# Configuring uWSGI

* `uwsgi:` section contains basic internal HTTP server configuration
  * `http: 127.0.0.1:8080` change to the port and to IP of listening network interface, or `0.0.0.0` for all network interfaces.
  * `threads: 4` change the number of threads for each web server process.
  * `offload-thread: 2` change the number of threads for serving static content.
  * `master: false` "For all practical serving deployments it’s not really a good idea not to use master mode."
* Note that all uwsgi defaults are built-in if you use the `run.sh`, no config is needed.

# Basics the Galaxy App

* `galaxy:` section contains application configuration
  * `database_connection` contains the SQLAlchemy connection string for database.
  * make sure dev settings `debug: false` and `use_interactive: false` are disabled.
  * `tool_config_file: 'config/tool_conf.xml,config/shed_tool_conf.xml'` specifies what tools to load.
  * `tool_dependency_dir: database/dependencies` is a folder where tool dependencies (Conda packages) go.

# Authentication Options

* `require_login: false` Force everyone to log in (disable anonymous access).
* `allow_user_creation: true` Allow unregistered users to create new accounts (otherwise, they will have to be created by an admin).
* `allow_user_deletion: false` Allow administrators to delete accounts.
* `allow_user_impersonation: false` Allow administrators to log in as other users (useful for debugging)

# Securing your Object IDs

* User facing object IDs
  * Galaxy uses the Blowfish cipher to obscure integer IDs.
  * Prevents guessing the hashes for various Galaxy objects.
  * `id_secret` is used as the Blowfish key.
  * Changing the default `id_secret` is a must.
  * Changing `id_secret` will change & invalid existing URLs (e.g. datasets, histories, workflows, etc).

# Customizing your "Brand"

* `brand` appends "/{brand}" to the "Galaxy" text in the masthead.
* `logo_url` sets the URL linked by the "Galaxy/brand" text.
* `wiki_url` sets the URL linked by the "Wiki" link in the "Help" menu.
* `support_url` sets the URL linked by the "Support" link in the "Help" menu.
* `citation_url` sets the URL linked by the "How to Cite Galaxy" link in the "Help" menu.
* `search_url` sets the URL linked by the "Search" link in the "Help" menu.
* `mailing_lists_url` sets the URL linked by the "Mailing Lists" link in the "Help" menu.
* `screencasts_url` sets the URL linked by the "Videos" link in the "Help" menu.
* `terms_url` sets the URL linked by the "Terms and Conditions".

# Adding a Notice box


* `message_box_visible: true`
* `message_box_content: Downtime scheduled Sunday at Noon to one.`
* `message_box_class: warning`

# Update the welcome page

Welcome page is `$GALAXY_ROOT/static/welcome.html` and is the first thing that
users see. It is a good idea to extend it with things like:
- Downtimes/Maintenance periods
- New tools
- Publications relating to your Galaxy

No restarting is necessary.

---
# Client Browser Security

* `sanitize_all_html` by default, Galaxy sanitizes all "text/html" tool outputs. Setting to false potentially exposes users to XSS attacks.
* `sanitize_whitelist_file` manually override html sanitization for listed tools. Can set in admin interface.
* `serve_xss_vulnerable_mimetypes` certain filetypes (e.g. SVG) can contain JS that is vulnerable to XSS (Cross-site scripting) and are served as "plain/text" by default.
* `allowed_origin_hostnames` Returns Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header that matches the Origin header of the request.

# Debugging

This should never be enabled on a public site.

* `debug: false` enable debug options, preserves cluster job data on disk
* `use_profile: false` Python profiler on request
* `use_printdebug: true` anything "print"ed within a Galaxy Web thread is exposed to user. Set to false in production.
* `use_interactive: false` Enable live debugging in your browser.

# Configuring Data Library Path Uploads

* Admins Only
  * `library_import_dir: ''` browse and upload files from configured directory.
  * `allow_path_paste: false` set to true to allow admins to paste any path to upload (e.g. `file://`), applies also to the general 'upload tool'.
* Users
  * `user_library_import_dir: ''` root directory containing sub-directories named by user emails. A nifty setup is that the value is the same as for `ftp_upload_dir` allowing users to upload files via FTP and then import them either in history or data library.
  * `user_library_import_dir_auto_creation: false` create user's folder upon login
  * `user_library_import_symlink_whitelist: ''` directories that users are allowed to symlink to.
  * `user_library_import_check_permissions: false` if Galaxy usernames match system usernames enable this to use UNIX permissions.

# galaxy.yml full options

a.k.a. Everything You Always Wanted to Know About `galaxy.yml`
* [config schema](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/lib/galaxy/webapps/galaxy/config_schema.yml)
* [config sample](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/config/galaxy.yml.sample)

# Configuring FTP

* `ftp_upload_dir` directory containing subdirectories matching users' identifier (defaults to e-mail)
* `ftp_upload_site` hostname of your FTP server provided to users in the help text. Must set to enable FTP import.
* `ftp_upload_dir_identifier` user attribute for subdirectory naming. 'email' (${user.email}) is default, but 'id' or 'username' are also common.
* `ftp_upload_dir_template` Python string template used to determine a users FTP upload directory (${ftp_upload_dir}/${ftp_upload_dir_identifier})
* `ftp_upload_purge` delete files after FTP import (true)

# Configuring SMTP

* SMTP server
  * `smtp_server` host:port of SMTP server to use. Uses STARTTLS, but will fallback.
  * `smtp_username` username for SMTP server
  * `smtp_password` password for SMTP server. STARTTLS recommended on SMTP server.
  * `smtp_ssl` if SMTP server requires SSL from connection start, set to true.
* Addresses
  * `error_email_to` address to send user error reports to.
  * `email_from` return address used in automatic user notifications. (`<galaxy-no-reply@HOSTNAME>`)
  * `mailing_join_addr` mailing list to subscribe users to during registration.

# Exercise: Configuring SMTP for Bug Reports

Install a mail tranfer agent (MTA):
* Here is a tutorial on how to [install Postfix MTA](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-postfix-as-a-send-only-smtp-server-on-ubuntu-14-04)

* set `smtp_server: localhost:25`
* set `error_email_to: you@email.tld` (use your email)
* Run a Galaxy tool the produces an error
* attempt to send a bug report
