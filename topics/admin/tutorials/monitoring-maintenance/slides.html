## Admin UI

Has a lot of tools and lists that are useful for administrators of the Galaxy server.

* Tools that list:
  * Data types
  * Data tables
  * Display applications


* Tools for manipulating
  * Users, groups, roles and quotas etc
  * Running jobs
  * Installed Tools
  * Errors etc

## Data Types

Data types are Galaxy's method of understanding how to handle data.

* Display of that data
* Which tools to present the data to
* Mime-types etc.
* Whether to allow specification at upload time
* Which tools are used to convert to different types/versions/indexes

The Admin UI has a link to display all the current data types that are registered.

Datatypes are located in the `datatypes_conf.xml` file.

## datatypes_conf.xml
Config file for datatypes. Hard to find stuff...
```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<datatypes>
  <registration converters_path="lib/galaxy/datatypes/converters" display_path="display_applications">
    <datatype extension="ab1" type="galaxy.datatypes.binary:Ab1" mimetype="application/octet-stream" display_in_upload="true" description="A binary sequence file in 'ab1' format with a '.ab1' file extension.  You must manually select this 'File Format' when uploading the file." description_url="https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Learn/Datatypes#Ab1"/>
    <datatype extension="afg" type="galaxy.datatypes.assembly:Amos" display_in_upload="false" />
    <datatype extension="arff" type="galaxy.datatypes.text:Arff" mimetype="text/plain" display_in_upload="True" />
    <datatype extension="asn1" type="galaxy.datatypes.data:GenericAsn1" mimetype="text/plain" display_in_upload="true" />
    <datatype extension="asn1-binary" type="galaxy.datatypes.binary:GenericAsn1Binary" mimetype="application/octet-stream" display_in_upload="true" />
    <datatype extension="axt" type="galaxy.datatypes.sequence:Axt" display_in_upload="true" description="blastz pairwise alignment format.  Each alignment block in an axt file contains three lines: a summary line and 2 sequence lines.  Blocks are separated from one another by blank lines.  The summary line contains chromosomal position and size information about the alignment. It consists of 9 required fields." description_url="https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Learn/Datatypes#Axt"/>
    <datatype extension="fli" type="galaxy.datatypes.tabular:FeatureLocationIndex" display_in_upload="false"/>
    <datatype extension="bam" type="galaxy.datatypes.binary:Bam" mimetype="application/octet-stream" display_in_upload="true" description="A binary file compressed in the BGZF format with a '.bam' file extension." description_url="https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Learn/Datatypes#BAM">
      <converter file="bam_to_bai.xml" target_datatype="bai"/>

...

```
**Excercise**: Allow **Genbank** files to be specified at upload time.

  * Search `/srv/galaxy/server/config/datatypes_conf.xml.sample` for Genbank
  * Add `display_in_upload="true"` to the xml tag.

You'll then need to restart Galaxy.

## Display applications

This link shows the list of applications that can be used to display various datatypes.

They are set in the `datatypes_conf.xml` file. For example:
```
  <datatype extension="bam" type="galaxy.datatypes.binary:Bam" mimetype="application/octet-stream" display_in_upload="true" description="A binary file compressed in the BGZF format with a '.bam' file extension." description_url="https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Learn/Datatypes#BAM">
      <converter file="bam_to_bai.xml" target_datatype="bai"/>
      <converter file="bam_to_bigwig_converter.xml" target_datatype="bigwig"/>
      <display file="ucsc/bam.xml" />
      <display file="ensembl/ensembl_bam.xml" />
      <display file="igv/bam.xml" />
      <display file="igb/bam.xml" />
      <display file="iobio/bam.xml" />
  </datatype>
```

We are not going to go into how to set these up here but there is a page on the [wiki](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Admin/Tools/External%20Display%20Applications%20Tutorial)

## Manage Jobs

An admin interface to list current unfinished jobs and finished jobs of a certain age.

* You can stop unfinished jobs
* You can show details of old jobs
* You can lock the server from spawning new jobs. (If you need to do maintenance.)

.large[
**Can be very handy!**
]

class: left
## Tool tools/UIs!

  * **Search Toolshed** - To install tools from the toolshed(s)

  * **Manage Installed Tools** - To list, manage, repair, upgrade, check status, uninstall or disable currently installed tools.

  * **Reset Metadata** - If something is wrong, try this!

  * **Tool Lineage** - Shows the revision history and default versions of tools.

# DB Shell

Sometimes it's the best way to get the exact data you need

Can be very useful for:
- Debugging
- Reporting
- Analytics

---
# Database Queries

"Can you send me the number of jobs per day/state from Main in September and October?"

```sql
SELECT
  date_trunc('month', j.create_time) AS month,
  j.state,
  COUNT(j.state) AS job_count
FROM job j
LEFT OUTER JOIN galaxy_user u
  ON j.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.email != 'monitor@bx.psu.edu'
GROUP BY month,
         j.state
HAVING date_trunc('month', j.create_time) >= '2016-09-01'
AND date_trunc('month', j.create_time) < '2016-11-01'
ORDER BY month, j.state;
```

# Analytics

Can we make better walltime decisions?

`scripts/runtime_stats.py`: Database-driven job runtime statistics

---
# Job Metrics

Galaxy can collect metrics on each job through configurable plugins in `job_metrics_conf.xml`.

Some plugins:
- `core`: Captures Galaxy slots, start and end of job, runtime
- `cpuinfo`: processor count for each job
- `env`: dump environment for each job
- `collectl`: monitor a wide array of system performance data

---
# Runaway Jobs

Tips:
- Set job output size limit in `job_conf.xml`
- Set job concurrency limits in `job_conf.xml`
- Public servers
  - Require email verification
  - Watch for duplicates

---
# Runaway Storage

Tips:
- Set quotas
- `tmpwatch` your job working directory
  - `cleanup_job` in `galaxy.ini` (defaults to `always` though)
- Set up dataset cleanup

---
# Dataset Cleanup

- `scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py`: PostgreSQL-optimized fast cleanup script
- `scripts/cleanup_datasets/cleanup_datasets.py`: General cleanup script

---
# Dataset Cleanup Lifecycle

Mark deleted all "anonymous" histories not used within the last `$days` days:

`python ./scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py -o $days -s delete_userless_histories`

Remove all history exports older than `$days` days:

`python ./scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py -o $days -s delete_exported_histories`

Mark purged HDAs in histories deleted `$days` or more days ago (not user-recoverable):

`python ./scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py -o $days -s purge_deleted_histories`

---
# Dataset Cleanup Lifecycle

Mark purged individual HDAs deleted `$days` or more days ago (not user-recoverable):

`python ./scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py -o $days -s purge_deleted_hdas`

Mark datasets with all purged HDAs last updated `$days` or more days ago deleted:

`python ./scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py -o $days -s delete_datasets`

Mark purged all datasets last updated `$days` or more days ago **and remove from disk**:

`python ./scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py -o $days -s purge_datasets`
