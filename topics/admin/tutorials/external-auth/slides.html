title: "External Authentication"
questions:
- How can I connect Galaxy with CAS, SAML, etc.
objectives:
- be familiar with configuring Galaxy to use an upstream (proxy) authentication provider
- be able to log in to your Galaxy server with a file-configured user.
key_points:
- Remote auth is not complex to set up and can help you meet institutional requirements

# Auth Mechanisms supported

* Galaxy-specific account database
* HTTP remote user provided by a reverse proxy server
* Galaxy authentication framework (LDAP/AD, PAM)

---
# Galaxy account

* Stored in the Galaxy DB
  * Unique in both email and username
  * Passwords hashed and salted, using PBKDF2 (default)
  * Table `galaxy_user`
  * Abstracted as `User` in `lib/galaxy/model/mapping.py`
* Session cookie expires after 3 months
  * Configurable with `session_duration`
* Password reset uses 'visit-link' mechanism
* `require_login` can be set to disable anonymous access

---
# Authentication tweaks

In `galaxy.yml`:
* Activation
  * `user_activation_on` will prevent accounts from running jobs until they visit activation link
  * `activation_grace_period` gives users some time before their jobs are ignored
  * `inactivity_box_content` defines the message shown to inactive users
* Expiration
  * `password_expiration_period` forces users to change password
* Disposable domain blacklist
  * `blacklist_file` defines domains (e.g. `example.org`) that will be rejected as user emails

# Reverse proxy

In `galaxy.yml`:
* Set `use_remote_user: true` to delegate authentication to the upstream proxy server
  * The proxy server should set the `REMOTE_USER` HTTP header
  * Disables regular logins

Dedicated Galaxy external auth [documentation](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/authentication.html#remote-user-authentication).

---
# General configuration

* If the proxy server returns only usernames, set `remote_user_maildomain` to a default mail domain to be appended
* If a client can bypass the proxy, it can impersonate any user by forging the `REMOTE_USER` HTTP header:
    * Configure the proxy server to define a `GX_SECRET` header and set `remote_user_secret` to the same value
* Set `remote_user_logout_href` to point to your logout URL

---
# Nginx

* Modules exist for PAM, Kerberos and LDAP.
* Most likely you'll need to recompile Nginx as none of them are included by default.

---
# Example PAM stack

* You need to set up your system's PAM stack (very site-specific)
* A PAM configuration that would be suitable for authentication with Kerberos (placed in `/etc/pam.d/nginx`) might look like:
  ```
  auth  [success=1 default=ignore]  pam_krb5.so minimum_uid=1000 ignore_k5login
  auth  requisite                   pam_deny.so
  auth  required                    pam_permit.so
  ```

---
# Example nginx.conf

```ini
location / {
    auth_pam "Basic Auth Realm Name";
    auth_pam_service_name "nginx";
    ...
    proxy_set_header REMOTE_USER $remote_user; # if using Paste
    uwsgi_param HTTP_REMOTE_USER $remote_user; # if using uWSGI
}
```

The value of `auth_pam_service_name` must match the filename of the pam configuration you created in `/etc/pam.d/` .

# Apache httpd

The authentication module (basic authentication, `mod_auth_kerb`, `mod_authnz_ldap`, `mod_auth_cas`, `Cosign`, etc.) is responsible for providing a username, which we will pass through the proxy to Galaxy as `$REMOTE_USER`.

In addition to the modules above, `mod_headers` must be enabled in the Apache config, for some types of authentication.

# Galaxy Authentication Framework

Authenticate to external services directly in Galaxy

Available [provider modules](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/tree/dev/lib/galaxy/auth/providers) for:
- Local Galaxy DB (default)
- LDAP/Active Directory
- [System (Linux) PAM](http://www.linux-pam.org/)
