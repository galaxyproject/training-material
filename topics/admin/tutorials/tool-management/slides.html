# Galaxy Vocabulary

* `tool` - XML file that describes to Galaxy how the underlying software works.
* `repository` - Versioned code archive in Tool Shed containing Galaxy tool(s).

---

# Ways to add tools

You can add tools to Galaxy either

* Manually - Trivial for trivial tools and useful for tool development.
* Using Tool Shed
  * Through admin UI in Galaxy
  * Using **ephemeris** (recommended)

---

# How to add tools manually

- By default Galaxy loads all tools in `tool_conf.xml.sample` into tool panel.
- To add local tools you need:
  - Make a copy `$ cp tool_conf.xml.sample tool_conf.xml`.
  - Add your tool entries to the `tool_conf.xml`.
  - Refresh the site

---

# How to install from the Tool Shed

* Find the repository you want to install.
* From Galaxy's admin UI find the repo in the connected TS.
* Install the repo into Galaxy.

---

# How to install with Ephemeris

* Find the repository you want to install.
* Run `shed-tools install` with the repository name

---

# What is ephemeris and what does it do?

Small Python library for Galaxy Management

* Install:

	- Reference data
	- Workflows
	- Data libraries
* `$ pip install ephemeris`

# More on Tool Management:

- tool installation
- configuration
- suites
- dependencies

---

## What happens during tool installation

* Repository was downloaded.
* If needed Galaxy downloaded and compiled the needed dependencies.
* Galaxy created an entry for the tool in the DB.
* Galaxy added the tool to one of the tool configs (`shed_tool_conf.xml`).

---

## Example config entry
 one entry in `shed_tool_conf.xml`

```xml
<section id="filter" name="Filter and Sort" version="">
  <tool file="testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/bamtools_filter/23a1c1f66b47/bamtools_filter/bamtools-filter.xml" guid="testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/bamtools_filter/bamFilter/0.0.1">
      <tool_shed>testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu</tool_shed>
        <repository_name>bamtools_filter</repository_name>
        <repository_owner>devteam</repository_owner>
        <installed_changeset_revision>23a1c1f66b47</installed_changeset_revision>
        <id>testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/bamtools_filter/bamFilter/0.0.1</id>
        <version>0.0.1</version>
    </tool>
</section>
```

---

## Example config entry

one entry in `integrated_tool_panel.xml`
```xml
<section id="filter" name="Filter and Sort" version="">
    <tool id="testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/bamtools_filter/bamFilter/0.0.1" />
```

---

## Suites - more repos in one

* To install multiple repositories some authors offer suites.
* Suite is a single repository that 'depends' on many other.
* If you install the suite all 'dependency repositories' will be installed too.

---

## Toolpanel management

* How the toolpanel looks like is decided in a file called `integrated_tool_panel.xml`.
* By default it resides in Galaxy's root folder.
* If missing it is generated from all other tool config files during startup.
* Modify it if you want to reorder tools or move section.

---

## Dependency resolvers

* We aim to make Galaxy resolver-independent.
* What resolver is going to be used for the tool dependency is determined at runtime and prioritised in `config/dependency_resolvers_conf.xml`.

```xml
<dependency_resolvers>
  <tool_shed_packages />
  <galaxy_packages />
  <conda />
  <galaxy_packages versionless="true" />
  <conda versionless="true" />
</dependency_resolvers>
```
