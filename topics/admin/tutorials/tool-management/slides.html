## Galaxy Vocabulary

* `tool` or `tool wrapper` - XML file that describes to Galaxy how the underlying software works.
* `repository` - Versioned code archive in Tool Shed containing Galaxy tool(s).
* `requirement` or `dependency` - the underlying software needed to execute the tool command

# Ways to add tools

You can add tools to Galaxy either

* Manually - useful for tool development.
* From the Tool Shed
  * Through the admin UI in Galaxy
  * Using **ephemeris** (recommended)

---

## How to add tools manually

- By default Galaxy loads all tools in `tool_conf.xml.sample` into tool panel.
- To add a local tool by hand:
  - Make a copy `$ cp tool_conf.xml.sample tool_conf.xml`.
  - Add your tool entry to the `tool_conf.xml`.
- To add local tools with the [galaxyproject.galaxy Ansible role][galaxy-role]:
  - Set `galaxy_local_tools` to the local tool paths
  - Run the playbook
- Tool dependencies need to be installed separately, unless
  `conda_auto_install: true` is set in `galaxy.yml` (not recommended for
  production)

## How to install from the Tool Shed

* Find the repository you want to install.
* From Galaxy's admin UI find the repo in the connected TS.
* Install the repo into Galaxy.

---

## How to install with Ephemeris

* Find the repository you want to install.
* Run `shed-tools install` with the repository name

---

# What is ephemeris and what does it do?

Small Python library for Galaxy Management

* Can install:
	- Tools
	- Reference data
	- Workflows
	- Data libraries
* `$ pip install ephemeris`
* https://github.com/galaxyproject/ephemeris
* https://ephemeris.readthedocs.io

# More on Tool Management:

- Tool installation
- Configuration
- Dependencies

---

## What happens when installing a tool from TS

* Repository is downloaded.
* If needed, Galaxy installs the tool's dependencies typically using [conda][conda].
* Galaxy creates an entry for the tool in its database.
* Galaxy adds the tool to `shed_tool_conf.xml` .

[conda]: https://conda.io/

## Example `shed_tool_conf.xml` entry

```xml
<section id="filter" name="Filter and Sort" version="">
  <tool file="testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/bamtools_filter/23a1c1f66b47/bamtools_filter/bamtools-filter.xml" guid="testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/bamtools_filter/bamFilter/0.0.1">
      <tool_shed>testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu</tool_shed>
        <repository_name>bamtools_filter</repository_name>
        <repository_owner>devteam</repository_owner>
        <installed_changeset_revision>23a1c1f66b47</installed_changeset_revision>
        <id>testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/bamtools_filter/bamFilter/0.0.1</id>
        <version>0.0.1</version>
    </tool>
</section>
```

---

## Tool panel management

* How the tool panel looks like is decided in a file called `integrated_tool_panel.xml`.
* By default it resides in Galaxy's `config/` folder.
* If missing it is generated from all other tool config files during startup.
* Modify it if you want to reorder tools or move section.

```xml
<section id="filter" name="Filter and Sort" version="">
    <tool id="testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/bamtools_filter/bamFilter/0.0.1" />
</section>
```

---

## Tool dependency resolution

* We aim to make Galaxy resolver-independent but Conda-oriented.
* What resolver is going to be used for the tool dependencies is determined at runtime
according to the order specified in `dependency_resolvers_conf.xml`.

```xml
<dependency_resolvers>
  <tool_shed_packages />
  <galaxy_packages />
  <conda />
  <galaxy_packages versionless="true" />
  <conda versionless="true" />
<!-- other resolvers
  <lmod />
  <lmod versionless="true" />
  <modules modulecmd="/opt/Modules/3.2.9/bin/modulecmd" />
  <modules modulecmd="/opt/Modules/3.2.9/bin/modulecmd" versionless="true" default_indicator="default" />
  <tool_shed_tap />
  <homebrew />
-->
</dependency_resolvers>
```

## Dependency resolution example

Tool XML contains:

```xml
<tool id="foo">
    <requirements>
        <requirement type="package" version="4.2">bar</requirement>
    </requirements>
</tool>
```

---
class: left

## `<tool_shed_packages />`

Did tool `foo` depend on a Tool Shed package providing `bar` 4.2 when installed?
- Yes: Query install DB for `repo_owner`, `repo_name`, `changeset_id`, then source:
  - `<tool_dependencies_dir>/bar/4.2/<repo_owner>/<repo_name>/<changeset_id>/env.sh`
- No: continue

---
class: left

## `<galaxy_packages />`

Does `<tool_dependency_dir>/bar/4.2/env.sh` exist?:
- Yes: source it
- No: Does `<tool_dependency_dir>/bar/4.2/bin/` exist?:
  - Yes: prepend it to `$PATH`
  - No: continue

Good for dependencies manually installed by an administrator

---
class: left

## `<conda />`

Does `bar==4.2` exist in Conda?:
- Yes: use `conda create` to create a Conda env in `<conda_prefix>/envs/` (if it doesn't exist already), then activate it
- No: continue

[Conda for tool dependencies FAQ](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/conda_faq.html)

---
class: left

## `<galaxy_packages versionless="true" />`

Does `<tool_dependency_dir>/bar/default/` exist and is it a symlink?:

- Yes: Does `<tool_dependency_dir>/bar/default/env.sh` exist?:
  - Yes: source it
  - No: Does `<tool_dependency_dir>/bar/default/bin/` exist?:
      - Yes: prepend it to `$PATH`
      - No: continue
- No: continue

---
class: left

## `<conda versionless="true" />`

Does `bar` (any version) exist in Conda?:
- Yes: use `conda create` to create env in job working directory
- No: continue

---
class: left

## `<modules modulecmd="..." />`

Is `bar/4.2` a registered module?:
- Yes: Load module `bar/4.2`
- No: continue

See: [Environment Modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net/)

---
class: left

## `<modules modulecmd="..." versionless="true" />`

Is `bar/default` a registered module?:
- Yes: Load module `bar/default`
- No: continue

---

## If dependency is not resolved

Submit the job anyway, maybe it's available on `$PATH`

---

## Using containers for Tool Dependencies

- Galaxy can also use **Docker** or **Singularity** containers to resolve dependencies
- You can read more about this in the [Tool Dependencies and Containers slides](../../../dev/tutorials/containers/slides.html)
