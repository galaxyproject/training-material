# Database Queries

Sometimes it's the best way to get the exact data you need

Can be very useful for:
- Debugging
- Reporting
- Analytics

But consider: [`gxadmin`](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/gxadmin) and sharing your SQL

???

- Admins often need to run database queries.
- Debugging the live application in production is difficult, but running queries is easy.
- Additionally running SQL queries is commonly used for debuggin and reporting and analytics.
- The community collects queries we commonly use in a program called gxadmin.

# Database Queries

"Can you send me the number of jobs per day/state from Main in September and October?"

```sql
SELECT
  date_trunc('month', j.create_time) AS month,
  j.state,
  COUNT(j.state) AS job_count
FROM job j
LEFT OUTER JOIN galaxy_user u
  ON j.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.email != 'monitor@bx.psu.edu'
GROUP BY month,
         j.state
HAVING date_trunc('month', j.create_time) >= '2016-09-01'
AND date_trunc('month', j.create_time) < '2016-11-01'
ORDER BY month, j.state;
```

???

- We often get requests like how many jobs were run in a time period, and did they finish successfully.
- So we write some SQL like this.
- As an admin, you'll want to understand SQL.

---
# Database Queries

```console
        month        |  state  | job_count
---------------------+---------+-----------
 2016-09-01 00:00:00 | deleted |     11369
 2016-09-01 00:00:00 | error   |     15375
 2016-09-01 00:00:00 | new     |      1179
 2016-09-01 00:00:00 | ok      |    165963
 2016-09-01 00:00:00 | paused  |       933
 2016-09-01 00:00:00 | waiting |         9
 2016-10-01 00:00:00 | deleted |     13190
 2016-10-01 00:00:00 | error   |     12539
 2016-10-01 00:00:00 | new     |      1183
 2016-10-01 00:00:00 | ok      |    167547
 2016-10-01 00:00:00 | paused  |       645
 2016-10-01 00:00:00 | queued  |        75
 2016-10-01 00:00:00 | running |        36
 2016-10-01 00:00:00 | waiting |        17
(14 rows)
```

???

- Here is the output of such a query.
- SQL is very powerful for extracting data and graphs for reporting.

---
# gxadmin

- It's unpleasant to write queries every time you need them.
- So the community collects SQL in `gxadmin`.
- It's a giant bash script full of SQL and some magic âœ¨
- [github.com/usegalaxy-eu/gxadmin](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/gxadmin)

???

- We often re-run the same queries.
- gxadmin makes it easier by storing the useful queries.
- everyone is welcome to contribute to it.

---
# Database Queries

"I need a list of current main toolshed users and a number of their repos"

```console
$ gxadmin query ts-repos
```

**OR**

```sql
SELECT
  u.username,
  COUNT(r.id) AS r_count
FROM galaxy_user u
JOIN repository r
  ON u.id = r.user_id
WHERE NOT r.deleted
GROUP BY u.id
ORDER BY r_count DESC
LIMIT 12;
```

???

- However, some of these queries we run over and over.
- And those we include in gxadmin.
- This way every admin has access to all of the interesting queries we run.
- And we don't get repetitive strain injury typing SQL.

                 username                 | r_count

(12 rows)
```

???

- Example output from the previous query.

# Database Queries

"What is the status of this job"

*Lots* of SQL or: `gxadmin report job-info <job-id>`

```console
# Galaxy Job 5132146

Property      | Value
------------- | -----
         Tool | toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/canu/canu/1.7
        State | running
      Handler | handler_main_2
      Created | 2019-04-20 11:04:40.854975+02 (3 days 03:35:04.881599 ago)
Job Runner/ID | condor / 568537
        Owner | e08d6c893f5

## Destination Parameters

Key                     |   Value
---                     |   ---
description             |   `canu`
priority                |   `-128`
request_cpus            |   `20`
request_memory          |   `64G`
```

???

- Another extremely common query is: what is the status of this job?
- There is a gxadmin command which aggregates information about jobs.
- This can help you debug job failure to run issues.

---

# Database Queries

"Get me a list of recently registered users"

```console
$ gxadmin query latest-users
```

**OR**

```sql
SELECT
	id,
	create_time AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' as create_time,
	pg_size_pretty(disk_usage) as disk_usage,
	username,
	email,
	active
FROM galaxy_user
ORDER BY create_time desc
LIMIT 40
```

???

- Another common query, who has recently joined our server?
- This is an easy command to write, but it is also included in gxadmin.

# Database Queries

```console

  id  |          create_time   | disk_usage |  username   |    email    |    groups    | active

```

???

- Example output of the previous query.
- With SQL you can choose just the columns or data that is relevant to you.
- This may not be so easily available in the interface.

---

# Tabular Output

Converting SQL query output to tabular and other formats

```SQL
COPY (...) to STDOUT with CSV DELIMITER E'\t'
```

**or**

```console
$ gxadmin query ...
$ gxadmin tsvquery ...
$ gxadmin csvquery ...
```

???

- However to reuse this data in other applications, the postgres format is not convenient.
- There is special syntax you can use to output CSV.
- gxadmin includes query variants to do this as well.

---

# Monitoring

Telegraf can consume Influx formatted output, which `gxadmin` can produce:

```console
$ gxadmin iquery queue
queue,tool_id=ncbi_blastx_wrapper/0.3.1,state=running count=76
queue,tool_id=rna_star/2.6.0b-2,state=queued count=36
queue,tool_id=rna_star/2.6.0b-2,state=running count=15
queue,tool_id=unicycler/0.4.7.0,state=running count=10
queue,tool_id=hisat2/2.1.0+galaxy4,state=running count=9
```

???

- For monitoring, many galaxy sites use Influx DB.
- gxadmin supports exporting influx compatible format.
- This makes it easy to add new data and graphs to your monitoring.
