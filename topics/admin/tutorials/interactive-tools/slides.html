# History

## 2015

@hexylena, @bgruening, and @jmchilton create Galaxy Interactive Environments (GIEs)

GIEs use Galaxy's *visualization framework* to run certain types of *interactive* visualizations (e.g. Jupyter Notebook)

GIEs run in a docker container on the Galaxy server or a single remote Docker server

---
# History

## 2016

Support for Docker Swarm is added, allowing running a cluster for GIEs

---
# History

## 2019

@blankenberg creates Galaxy Interactive Tools (GxITs)

Building on the GIE concept, but run as *tools*

Tools run just as any other Galaxy job (e.g. via Slurm, HTCondor)

You will sometimes see Interactive Tools referred to as Interactive Environments version 2

# Tool config syntax

```xml
<tool id="interactive_tool_jupyter_notebook" tool_type="interactive" name="Interactive Jupyter Notebook" version="0.1">
    <requirements>
        <container type="docker">quay.io/bgruening/docker-jupyter-notebook:ie2</container>
    </requirements>
    <entry_points>
        <entry_point name="Jupyter Interactive Tool" requires_domain="True">
            <port>8888</port>
            <url>ipython/lab</url>
        </entry_point>
    </entry_points>
</tool>
```

# Mapping clients to containers

- GIEs: Unique path, e.g. `https://galaxy.example.org/gie-proxy/jupyter/...`
  - Pros: Works with existing SSL certificate
  - Cons: Requires Galaxy session cookie (no sharing), can only run one at a time, closing your browser loses your session
- GxITs: Unique hostname, e.g. `https://<unique-id>.interactivetoolentrypoint.interactivetool.galaxy.example.org/`
  - Pros: Needs no special credentials (can be shared)
  - Cons: Requires *wildcard* DNS entry and *wildcard* SSL certificate (not possible at many sites)

# Galaxy configuration

Enable docker on a destination in `job_conf.xml` and assign your GxITs to that destination

.left[Set in `galaxy.yml`:]
```yaml
interactivetools_enable: true
interactivetools_map: /srv/galaxy/var/gie-proxy-sessions.sqlite
```

---
# Proxy configuration

Use the uWSGI proxy configuration that ships with Galaxy

Or the [Node.js-based proxy][usegalaxy_eu-gie_proxy]

# Security

The default docker-enabled container exposes all datasets to the tool

Normally this isn't bad (normal tools can't be controlled by the user)

Interactive tools are fully user controllable

Solution: [Embedded Pulsar][job-conf-pulsar-embedded]

# Embedded Pulsar

Runs a [Pulsar][pulsar] server within the Galaxy application to "stage" (i.e. copy) inputs.

- Pros: Inputs in isolated dir so only that dir is mounted in the container: secure
- Cons: Has to copy inputs on each Interactive Tool execution: slow
