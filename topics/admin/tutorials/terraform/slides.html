### Why Terraform

- Managing complex infrastructure is not easy

- Needs to be reproducible

- Needs to be failure resistant

---

### Pets vs Cattle

.pull-left[
- A special, lovingly raised server
- When they become ill you nurse them back to health
- Everyone is sad when it dies
]

.pull-right[
- Generic and replacable
- If one gets sick, you just kill it
- If one dies, no one is sad
]

## Terraform

"Infrastructure as Code"

- Write code
- Plan changes
- Create reproducible infrastructure

---

### Write: Infrastructure as Code

- Your infrastructure is completely specified by easy-to-edit text files

- Collaborate on infrastructure using git/hg/etc.

- Automate everything using one piece of software (instead of OpenStack CLI + AWS CLI + ... )

```ini
resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "my-server" {
  name            = "my-server"
  image_name      = "CentOS 7"
  flavor_name     = "m1.large"
}

resource "aws_route53_record" "my.server" {
  name    = "my.server.example.org"
  records = ["${openstack_compute_instance_v2.my-server.access_ip_v4}"]
}
```

---

### Plan: your changes

- See how changes will affect resources

- Preview the planned changes before applying them

Easy to see which resources need to be recreated, can produce a nice graph of their dependencies.

---

### Create: Reproducible Infrasturcture

- Combine resources across providers (VM from OpenStack, DNS from Amazon, everything done in correct order)

- Consistently reproduce the same infrastructure in a new cloud, new project.

This was a fantastically useful feature for UseGalaxy.eu, we transitioned smoothly between two OpenStack clouds because we just could say `terraform apply` in our new cloud, our entire infrastructure was reproduced.
