## Data Types

* Galaxy's method of understanding users' files.
* Data types and converters are shipped with Galaxy.
* Admin UI displays all available data types.
  * Can be configured by modifying `config/datatypes_conf.xml` file.
* Use class inheritance (`text:json` is a super class of `hivtrace`, `biom1`, `d3_hierarchy`...)
  * Affects how tools consume datasets.

???
Some datatypes can be installed from toolshed but this practice is deprecated and discouraged.

# Data Providers

Provide efficient access to data for viz & API

Framework provides direct link to read the raw dataset
or use data providers to adapt it

In config, assert that visualization requires a given type of data providers

Data providers process data before sending to browser - slice, filter, reformat, ...
