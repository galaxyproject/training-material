                <p><a href="https://galaxy-synbiocad.org/">Galaxy-SynBioCAD portal</a> is the first toolshed for synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, and industrial biotechnology (<span class="citation"><a href="#Hrisson2022">Hérisson <i>et al.</i> 2022</a></span>). It provides a set of Retrosynthesis tools aimed at finding pathways to synthesize heterologous compounds in chassis organisms (<strong>RetroRules</strong> (<span class="citation"><a href="#Duigou2018">Duigou <i>et al.</i> 2018</a></span>), <strong>RetroPath2.0</strong> (<span class="citation"><a href="#Delpine2018">Delépine <i>et al.</i> 2018</a></span>), <strong>RP2Paths</strong>, <strong>rpCompletion</strong>).</p>

<p>Retrosynthesis is a concept originally proposed for synthetic chemistry where chemists have to work backwards, starting from a target product to reach precursors that are endogenous to the chassis (host organism).</p>

<p>Typically, the target compound, also named “source compound” is the compound of interest one wishes to produce, while the precursors are usually compounds that are natively present in a chassis strain.</p>

<center><img src="../../images/chassis_target.png" width="500" alt="Chassis - target" /></center>

<p>In this tutorial, we want to obtain the reactions producing the lycopene (source) into the iML1515 <em>Escherichia Coli</em> strain (chassis).</p>

<p>To do that, we will use the following RetroSynthetis Workflow composed of 3 key steps.</p>

<p>First, we aggregate the metabolites present in the chassis and download reaction rules.</p>

<p>Then, RetroPath2.0 generates feasible metabolic routes between a collection of chemical species contained within a GEM SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language) file of the selected organism, a target molecule that the user wishes to produce, and reaction rules extracted from RetroRules.</p>

<p>Lastly, the metabolic network is then deconstructed into individual pathways using RP2paths and rpCompletion takes those individual metabolic pathways to filter them (duplicated pathways are removed), splits them into sub-pathways by adding the appropriate cofactors, and finally converted them to SBML files.</p>

<p><a href="../../images/Retrosynthesis_Workflow.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/Retrosynthesis_Workflow.png" alt="Retrosynthesis Workflow. " width="2514" height="682" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

<p>Note that we will run the steps of this workflow individually so as not to neglect the understanding of the intermediate steps as well. Then, we will run the workflow automatically so that it itself retrieves the outputs from the previous step and gives them as input to the next tool.</p>

<h1 id="data-preparation">Data Preparation</h1>

<p>RetroSynthesis workflow will be run with the following inputs:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The International Chemical Identifier (InChI) of the compound of interest to produce,</li>
  <li>The structure of metabolites present in the chosen chassis (E. coli),</li>
  <li>Reaction rules (generated by RRules Parser node that calls RetroRules).</li>
</ol>

<p>The data used are pretty straight forward to obtain.<br />
Firstly, we download an SBML model, then we select all sinks to use into the RetroPath2.0 software from this model.<br />
Lastly, we request from RetroRules all possible reactions to find a chemical reaction cascade that produces the target.</p>

<p>RetroPath2.0 is an open-source tool for building retrosynthesis networks by combining reaction rules and a retrosynthesis-based algorithm to link the desired target compound to a set of available precursors.
The RetroPath2.0 tool is freely available at <a href="https://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/4987.html">myExperiment</a>.
The retrosynthesis network is outputted as a CSV file providing reactions in the reaction SMILES format and chemicals in both SMILES and InChI formats along with other information like the score for each reaction.</p>

        <p>Each reaction rule can correspond to several template reactions, the task here is to enumerate the different possible transformations according to these templates.
Because the RetroRules reaction rules consider only one substrate at a time, some compounds are by purpose omitted: the task here is to complete the predicted reactions by putting back these omitted compounds (mostly  cofactors).
The node converts each predicted pathway to distinct SBML files.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In this tutorial we produced candidates pathways to produce Lycopene in an Esherichia Coli strain.
Three main steps were involved:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Preprocessing data</li>
  <li>Run Retrosynthesis algorithm with RetroPath2.0</li>
  <li>Enumerate all solutions found by RetroPath2.0</li>
</ol>
