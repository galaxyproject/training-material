                <p>Synthetic biology is a novel engineering discipline which requires computational tools for the design of metabolic pathways for the production of chemicals such as SynBioCAD portal which is the first Galaxy set of tools for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering (<span class="citation"><a href="#Hrisson2022">Hérisson <i>et al.</i> 2022</a></span>).</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will use a set of tools from the <strong>Genetic Design - BASIC Assembly Workflow</strong> (https://galaxy-synbiocad.org) which will enable you to design plasmids implementing metabolic pathways for the bioproduction of lycopene in <em>E.coli</em> (one of the preferred host cell for microbial biochemicals production).</p>

<p>Lycopene is a potent antioxidant and has been widely used in the fields of pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics. It’s widely found in fruits including tomato, watermelon, guava, and papaya but the extraction method of lycopene from these natural sources is expensive, complicated and cannot match the large market demand.</p>

<p>To address this demand, synthetic biology and metabolic engineering have been employed to develop microbial cell factories (e.g. <em>E.coli</em> strains) for lycopene production.</p>

<p>To design plasmids encoding lycopene bioproducing pathways, we will use the BASIC assembly method (as described in <span class="citation"><a href="#Storch2015">Storch <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>) which relies on orthogonal linkers and type IIs restriction enzyme cleavage to provide a robust and accurate assembly of DNA parts into plasmid constructs. From these construct definition, the workflow will generate scripts enabling the automatic build of the plasmids as well as the transformation of strains using an Opentrons liquid handler robot. After downloading these scripts onto a computer connected to an Opentrons, one can perform the automated construction of the plasmids at the bench.</p>

<p>The workflow scheme we will use is shown below. First, we will run the steps of this workflow individually so as not to neglect the understanding of the intermediate steps as well. Then, we will run the workflow automatically so that it itself retrieves the outputs from the previous step and gives them as input to the next tool.</p>

<p>At first, a pathway generated by the <strong>Pathway Analysis workflow</strong> (https://galaxy-synbiocad.org) is provided as input to the Selenzyme tool (<span class="citation"><a href="#Carbonell2018">Carbonell <i>et al.</i> 2018</a></span>). Selenzyme searches for enzymes corresponding to each reaction of the pathway. It performs a reaction similarity search in the reference reaction database <a href="https://www.metanetx.org">MetaNetX</a> and outputs an updated SBML file annotated with the enzyme UniProt IDs.
The tool provides several scores that can be combined in order to define an overall score. Scores are given for reaction similarity, conservation based on a multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic distance between source organism and host, and additional scores calculated from sequence properties as shown in the example bellow.</p>

<p>Second, the BasicDesign tool extracts enzyme IDs contained in the SBML (previously produced by Selenzyme) to generate genetic constructs compliant with the BASIC assembly approach. It uses as input an SBML file annotated with enzyme IDs for each reaction, and optionally one or several CSV files listing by their IDs the linkers, the promoters and the backbone used (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parts_for_lycopene.csv</code>). Example, below:</p>

<p><em>id,type,sequence,comment</em><br />
<em>L1,neutral linker,,</em><br />
<em>L2,neutral linker,,</em><br />
<em>L3,neutral linker,,</em></p>

<p>For <strong>linkers</strong>, the type annotation should be one of <em>neutral linker</em>, <em>methylated linker</em>, <em>peptide fusion linker</em> or <em>RBS linker</em>. For <strong>user parts</strong>, type should be one of <em>backbone</em> or <em>constitutive promoter</em>. Other type will raise a warning and will be omited.</p>

<p>BasicDesign converts the SBML file into CSV files describing the DNA-parts to be included into each construct (in an operon format, i.e. with only one promoter) and enumerate possible combinations of promoters, RBSs and enzymes into constructs. Depending on the numbers of enzymes per reaction, of RBSs and promoters available, and whether or not to perform CDS permutation within the operon, the number of constructs may vary.</p>

      <li>DNA-Bot outputs python scripts that implement the 4 assembly steps: clip reactions, purification, assembly and strain transformation. In short, the <strong>Clip reactions</strong> step prepares the mixes for the ligation of the individual DNA parts with the linkers; the <strong>Purification</strong> step purifies the linker-ligated DNA parts using magnetic beads and the Opentrons magnetic module; the <strong>Assembly</strong> step mixes the DNA purified parts to build the final constructs; while the <strong>Transformation</strong> step transforms the chassis micro-organism with the plasmid and inoculates onto agar.</li>
