title: Synthetic Biology
summary: |
  Synthetic Biology is the engineering of biology : the deliberate (re)design and construction of novel biological and biologically based parts, devices and systems to perform new functions for useful purposes, that draws on principles elucidated from biology and engineering.
  By applying these principles to living systems, Synthetic Biology overcomes mimicry and optimisation-led research and introduces a rationale and systematic approach to the construction and (re)design.
  Synthetic Biology is at the intersection of engineering, bioscience, chemistry, and information technology.
  The goal of synthetic biology is to extend or modify the behavior of organisms and engineer them to perform new tasks. 
  In this section, the tutorials shows how to design metabolic pathways for producing the desired chemical targets.
