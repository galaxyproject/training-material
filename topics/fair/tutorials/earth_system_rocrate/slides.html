# Workflow context

The workflow used as an example here goes from :
- First, produce a protein FASTA file from a nucleotide FASTA file using ({% tool [Prodigal](tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/prodigal/prodigal/2.6.3+galaxy0) %}) (a tool that predicts protein-coding genes from DNA sequences).
- Then, use ({% tool [InterProscan](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/interproscan/interproscan/5.59-91.0+galaxy3) %}) to create a tabular. Interproscan is a batch tool to query the InterPro database. It helps identify and predict the functions of proteins by comparing them to known databases.
- Finally, discover ({% tool [SanntiS](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/ecology/sanntis_marine/sanntis_marine/0.9.3.5+galaxy1) %}) both to build genbank and especially to detect and annotate biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs).

## Run the workflow

Import and run the [Biosynthetic Gene Clusters workflow](https://earth-system.usegalaxy.eu/u/marie.josse/w/marine-omics-identifying-biosynthetic-gene-clusters)

To know more on how to do that follow the [tutorial]({% link topics/ecology/tutorials/marine_omics_bgc/tutorial.,d %})
---


## Generate the RO-Crate 

Once you run the workflow you can generate the RO-Crate. To do so follow the [tutorial]({% link topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-in-galaxy/tutorial.md %})
