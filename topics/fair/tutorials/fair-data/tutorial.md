# Introduction
This course is an extended introduction to FAIR Galaxy data mangement. The renewed focus is on FAIR data â€“ that is data that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. This addresses a key initiative of the Galaxy and will prepare you to benefit from the vast amount of publicly available biomedical data. Emphasis on teaching have been maitained to answer how to analyze epigenomics data, as the skills required to analyze large methylome data sets are rapidly transferable to transcriptomics and metabolomics.

You can find out more at the [FAIR Pointers](https://elixir-uk-dash.github.io/FAIR-Pointers/ep1/index.html) online course.

# FAIR bioinformatics analysis of life science data
Researchers often have difficulty locating, accessing, and combining relevant omic data from external sources. They may also have difficulty locating the raw data or source code. This can reduce the value of the generated information.

These challenges can make it difficult for researchers to get the most out of omic data. However, there are a number of tools and resources that can help researchers to overcome these challenges. For example, there are databases that index records, and there are tools that can help researchers to combine datasets from different sources. This lesson propose the advance application of FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) to produce the analysis and outcmes supported by searchable metadata to encourge secondary use.

## Planning and design of research
Findability and Accessibility of metadata can then be ensured by a (...)

This concept have been testes by developing such a specification in a

## Data choices, sampling and acquisition

## Data processing and analysis

## Sharing is caring

# Conclusion
Data fairness is important for good research practice because it ensures that the data that researchers use is accurate and reliable. When data is fair, it is less likely to be biased, and it is more likely to be representative of the population it is intended to represent. This means that the results of research that is based on fair data are more likely to be accurate and reliable.
