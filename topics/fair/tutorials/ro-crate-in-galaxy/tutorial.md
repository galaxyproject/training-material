Workflows are a powerful Galaxy feature that allows you to scale up your analysis by performing an end-to-end analysis with a single click of a button. In order to keep provenance of the workflow invocation (an invocation of a workflow means one run or execution of the workflow) it can be exported from Galaxy in the form of a [Workflow Run Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/wfrun/workflow) RO-Crate profile.

Additionally, the exported Workflow Run Crate allows for sharing workflow run provenance with those unfamiliar with Galaxy and its standard export format.

This tutorial will guide you through the steps of defining such a report for your workflow, .

This tutorial will show you how to generate Galaxy-based [Workflow Run RO-Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/) after running the workflow.

{% include _includes/cyoa-choices.html option1="Locally" option2="Not_locally" default="Not_locally"
       text="Are you running Galaxy locally ?" %}
       
<div class="Locally" markdown="1">

## Enable RO-Crate on your local instance
> <hands-on-title>Update your galaxy configuration</hands-on-title>
> - Go to where your Galaxy folder is in your computer
> - In your root Galaxy folder navigate to the `config` folder where a the `galaxy.yml` should be located. Please open it.
> - (In case you only find a `galaxy.yml.sample` file, copy this one and name it `galaxy.yml`) 
> - make sure the option `enable_celery_tasks` is set to `true`:
> ```
> galaxy:
>       enable_celery_tasks: true
> ```
> That's it ! Now you can launch your local instance as usual.

## Import an example workflow

For this tutorial, we will use the workflow from the [Galaxy 101 for everyone tutorial]({% link topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-101-everyone/tutorial.md %}). If you have not done this tutorial yet, the only thing you need to know is that this is a workflow that takes as input a table of data about different species of iris plants, this table is subsequently sorted and filtered, and some plots are made. The specifics of the workflow are not important for this tutorial, only that it outputs a number of different kinds of outputs (images, tables, etc).

We will start by importing this workflow into your Galaxy account:

> <hands-on-title>Import the workflow</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. **Import the workflow** into Galaxy
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/workflows_run_trs.md path="topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/workflow-reports/workflows/galaxy-101-everyone.ga" title="Galaxy 101 for Everyone" %}
>
{: .hands_on}


## Run the workflow

Galaxy will produce several export options for any workflow. The default export gives us a serialization of the invocation data model while the RO-Crate export gives an Workflow Run Crate which includes the default export as well.

Letâ€™s run the workflow and export the RO-Crate.

> <hands-on-title>Run the workflow</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Import the file `iris.csv` via link
>
>    ```
>    https://zenodo.org/record/1319069/files/iris.csv
>    ```
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/datasets_import_via_link.md %}
>
> 2. Run **GTN Training: Galaxy 101 For Everyone** workflow using the following parameters:
>    - *"Send results to a new history"*: `No`
>    - *"1: Iris Dataset""*: the `iris.csv` file we just uploaded
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/workflows_run.md  %}
>
> 3. **View the workflow outputs** once the workflow has completed
>    - The workflow produces several text and tabular outputs, and two plot (image) outputs
>

## Export the Workflow Run Crate

After the workflow has completed, we can export the RO-Crate. The crate does not appear in your history, but can be accessed from the {% icon galaxy-history-options %} **-> Show Invocations** menu on the top right of your history OR on the left pannel from the {% icon galaxy-panelview %} Workflow Invocations .

> <hands-on-title>Export the Workflow Run Crate</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. In the top right of your history, go to {% icon galaxy-history-options %} **-> Show Invocations**
>
>    ![screenshot of the history options to get the Show invocations button](./images/show_invocation.png)
>
> 2. Our latest workflow run should be listed at the top.
>    - Click on it to expand it:
>
>    ![screenshot of the workflow invocations menu, with our latest invocation at the top](./images/workflow-invocation-summary.png)
>
> 3. Click on the **Export** tab in the expanded view of the workflow invocation.
>
> 4. Click on the Export tab in the expanded view of the workflow invocation.
>        You should see a page that contains three download options:
> 	     - Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) 
> 	     - BioCompute Object
> 	     - File
> 5. Click on the **Generate** {% icon galaxy-download %} option of the RO-Crate box (1st box)

Great work! You have created a Workflow Run Crate. This makes it easy to track the provenance of the executed workflow.
