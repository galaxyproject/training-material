<p>The FAIR Guiding Principles aid in designing data publishing platforms for easier manual and automated deposition, exploration, sharing, and reuse <span class="citation"><a href="#wilkinson">Wilkinson <i>et al.</i> 2016</a></span>. FAIR stands for specific improvements in data management and archival practices as it outlines clear, high-level, domain-independent principles that can be used to create a variety of scholarly outputs:</p>

<p>Table 1: The FAIR guiding principles as described in Wilkinson, M., Dumontier, M., Aalbersberg, I. et al. The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship <span class="citation"><a href="#wilkinson">Wilkinson <i>et al.</i> 2016</a></span>.</p>

<p>A report from the European Commission Expert Group on <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1285272#.ZGc58exByha">FAIR data</a> describes the origins of FAIR and its development in 2014-2015 by a <a href="https://force11.org/groups/">FORCE11</a> Working Group. The following exercise dips into this report and asks you to investigate some of FAIR’s history and foundation.</p>

<h2 id="open-data-and-fair">Open data and FAIR</h2>
<p>The level of accessibility and usability criteria distinguish open from FAIR data. Open data is accessible without limitations, whereas FAIR data specifies certain requirements for access and use.</p>

<p><a href="../../images/fair_open.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/fair_open.png" alt="text reading fair does not equal open. " width="1836" height="324" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

<p>Open data can be modified, and distributed for any reason. Although extensively used and accessible, FAIR data additionally includes the following usability standards that go beyond permission alone:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In order to be found and cited, FAIR data must be identified and deposited into online public records.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary to make FAIR data available so that it may be accessed, read, and processed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>FAIR data needs to be captured and presented in a form that can be used.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The published FAIR Guiding Principles: Wilkinson, M., Dumontier, M., Aalbersberg, I. et al. The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship <span class="citation"><a href="#wilkinson">Wilkinson <i>et al.</i> 2016</a></span>.</p>

<h2 id="fairification-and-fairness-of-data">FAIRification and FAIRness of data</h2>
<p>Making your data FAIR compatible involves adopting the 15 guiding principles listed in Table 1, which is the process known as “FAIRification.” The degree to which you adhere to these criteria determines how FAIR your data are. In other words, FAIRness refers to how FAIR your data is to a certain level and indicates a tacit method of evaluating its compliance.</p>

<p>Documentation and frameworks for data FAIRification. Each of the 15 FAIR principles is put into context with real data examples: <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">GO FAIR</a>, <a href="https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/content/home.html">FAIR Cookbook</a>.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The FAIR Principles place a strong focus on encouraging individual data reuse while also supporting the capacity of machines to automatically discover and utilise the data. This short introduction aims to develop and disseminate guidance and processes needed to make and keep data FAIR.</p>
