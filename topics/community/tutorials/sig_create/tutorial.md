So you have decided to create a new Special Interest Group (**SIG**)!

# Do you need to make a SIG?

Before you make a SIG, make sure that you have learned the basics about Galaxy. Start with our dedicated [**Get Started**](https://galaxyproject.org/get-started/) page to get a head-start of what Galaxy is about.

Starting and running a **SIG** takes time and effort, so it's a good idea to make sure that:

 1. **You have a buddy** Do you already have someone who wants to join this community and help build it with you? There's no sense in starting a **SIG** of one!
 2. **You are committed** We have resources to help you and are constantly trying to make running a **SIG** easier, but it nevertheless takes time. You don't want to start a **SIG** and then fail to maintain it.

 > <warning-title>Do not contribute to software smog!</warning-title>
 > Do not create a SIG that you cannot sustain! Do not create a SIG that already exists!
 {: .warning}

Saying that, running a **SIG** can be deeply rewarding when you see people coming together across disciplines, institutes, and more to find synergy and make cool things happen together.

Let's walk you through making a new Galaxy **SIG**.

# Requirements of a Special Interest Group (SIG)

Before starting a **SIG**, it's important to be aware of the (rather low) requirements for being a **SIG**:

* Must have 2 or more members
* Must maintain a page on the Community Hub with at least:
  * A description of the purpose of the SIG.
  * A clear explanation of how individuals can join and maintain membership.
  * Details of access to the SIGâ€™s communication channels.
  * The current contact/email address for the nominated [Galaxy Community Board](https://galaxyproject.org/community/governance/gcb/) representative
* Must manage membership and internal communication for itself.
* Must use at least one public Matrix channel under the Galaxy Matrix space.
* Must allow participation across different timezones (with the exception of **Regional Communities**).

# Creating a new SIG

> <hands-on-title>Create a SIG</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. **Copy an updated SIG page** (there's a Template in that folder, work in progress!) [from the Galaxy Community Hub github folder](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub/blob/master/content/community/sig/). We suggest looking through the different SIG pages to see which one has the type of content you would like and copying that one.
> 2. **Update the text** to suit your new SIG
> 3. **Create a Matrix group** within the Galaxy Matrix chat forum space.
>   - Consider making a bridge to a Slack chat if you want to talk with users!
> 4. (Optional): **Create a mailing list** for your SIG: https://lists.galaxyproject.org/lists/
> 5. **Add your SIG** & any relevant links to the [SIG directory](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub/blob/master/content/community/sig/index.md)
> 6. Send someone to **join the Galaxy Community Board**, which has tons of resources to support you and also a chat forum on Matrix.

Remember that **SIGs** vary hugely. Some **SIGs** meet and collaborate frequently, while others use their **SIG** to simply provide a key contact individual to represent their group in the Galaxy community. You don't need every link, widget or calendar we create to run a good **SIG**. Just make what fits your group's needs. Above all, think sustainably - someone has to keep things updated, and that someone likely starts with you!

# Sustainability

Remember that if you make a **SIG**, you are responsible for *maintaining* that **SIG**.

This at a minimum includes:

1. A section on the [SIG Directory on the Hub](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/)
2. Your individual SIG page from the Hub that is linked from that directory

This may also include:
1. Your SIG Training page
2. Mailing list

## Ending a SIG

If you collectively decide that the **SIG** is no more, please end your SIG.

> <hands-on-title>End a SIG</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Update the [SIG Directory on the Hub](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/)
> 2. Remove your individual SIG page from the Hub
> 3. Notify the [Galaxy Community Board](https://galaxyproject.org/community/governance/gcb/), ideally via their chat channel

# Conclusion

Did you make a SIG? {% icon congratulations %} Congratulations! Being a part of a **SIG** is one of the best bits of working with Galaxy, so well done you for enabling that for like-minded scientists!

Or did you realise that you didn't need to make a **SIG**? {% icon congratulations %} Congratulations to you as well, for preventing the software smog of creating unneeded webpages.
