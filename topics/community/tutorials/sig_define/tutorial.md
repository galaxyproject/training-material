# Special Interest Groups

In Galaxy, the term *[Special Interest Group](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig)* (**SIG**) refers to a dedicated scientific community that crosses individual lab boundaries and wants to collaborate, share resources, support each other, and/or collectively advocate on a given theme. We have **SIGs** based on [**region**](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/#regional-communities), [**domain of science**](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/#communities-of-practice), and more. You might consider that a **SIG** covers any group of like-minded Galaxy enthusiasts not currently combined into a [**Working Group**](https://galaxyproject.org/community/wg/).

## Characteristics of SIGs

**SIGs** vary hugely. Some **SIGs** meet and collaborate frequently, while others use their **SIG** to simply provide a key contact individual to represent their group in the Galaxy community. The following list, therefore, does not necessary apply to every SIG, but can give you a general idea of what **SIGs** can get up to.

**SIGs** can be:
* Focused on user community development
* Self-regulated, which includes organising meetings, developing training material and tools, maintaining the Hub and training pages, and choosing a representative for the [Galaxy Community Board](https://galaxyproject.org/community/governance/gcb/)
* Long-term or transient
* Supported with administrative infrastructure provided by the Galaxy Project and the [GCB](https://galaxyproject.org/community/governance/gcb/), including:
  * mailing list
  * website infrastructure and a place on the Galaxy hub to present the Community
  * presentation slot at the annual GCC conference
  * Chat channel/room
* Set up to gather input from members
* Represented in the [Galaxy Community Board](https://galaxyproject.org/community/governance/gcb/) which articulates needs to the Galaxy community to influence the next innovations (known to software developers as a Roadmap process: the selection of priorities for the coming years)

# Purpose of a SIG

Taking into account the wide variety of **SIGs**, the following are often priorities for **SIGs**.

## Prevent work duplication

It’s surprisingly easy for individuals halfway across the world to need the same tool and build the same tool.
What a waste of time when there are so many cool things to do!

## Highlight new resources

If you’re working in the same research area, for instance, it can be exciting when someone builds something new that could help your research. With so many things getting added daily, it’s easy to miss this news. SIGs can point out such highlights and give you new ideas for your research or work.

## Peer review

Need someone to look at an issue? Want some feedback on a tutorial or tool? Your fellow SIG members are a lot more likely to help you if you help them, and, more importantly, if they know who you are. Cut through the 1.8k of issues on Github by making some work friends in your field.

## Build community

The bigger the community you have, the more power in developing further resources (or grant proposals!), finding collaborators, co-authoring papers, etc. Higher user counts give you more sway in decision-making and building up Galaxy further, advancing your own work. It’s a lot easier to say you need something and 100 users agree, than to ask on behalf of yourself alone.

## Many hands make light work

Users want tools, workflows, training, and events. When delivering training (like [Smorgasbord](https://gallantries.github.io/posts/2021/03/01/smörgåsbord/) global training events) or projects, explaining who you are to a grant board, or recruiting individuals to your SIG, it’s rather important that the website you point to, quite frankly, looks nice. Building tools, preparing training material, delivering events, and updating web pages takes time. If you can share these tasks amongst a **SIG**, you ensure sustainability and increase impact.

# How do Working Groups & Special Interest Groups differ?

[Working Groups **(WGs)**](https://galaxyproject.org/community/wg/) are distinct from **SIGs**.

**WGs** are:

* Focused on technical issues
* Managing important project infrastructure assets, including source code, for the long term
* Represented in the [Galaxy Technical Board](https://galaxyproject.org/community/governance/gtb/), which contributes to the roadmap (prioritisation of innovation goals in Galaxy) by providing technical input and requesting resources for technical and development activities

You can find a directory of current [**WGs** below](https://galaxyproject.org/community/wg/).

# Representation in Galaxy Governance

SIGs send (at least one) representative to the [Galaxy Community Board (GCB)](https://galaxyproject.org/community/governance/gcb/), which meets throughout the year to share useful tips and practices, as well as collects ideas for promoting via the Galaxy Governance structure to enact global change across numerous groups of individuals. Global software development is tricky, and effective communication and representation is key for making things happen to benefit our SIGs.

# How to join a SIG

You can find out how to join any given SIG by going to their SIG page, which you can peruse from the [SIG directory](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/).

> Being part of a **SIG** is awesome! You find people from different institutes, disciplines or regions who are all excited about the same thing. It's one of the best bits of the Galaxy Community more broadly - it's a welcoming and energetic bunch!

If you do not find a SIG that represents your interest, you may want to make one!

# Conclusion

{% icon congratulations %} Congratulations! You've made it to the end! Hopefully you think **SIGs** are brilliant and maybe you have joined one, or want to start one!
