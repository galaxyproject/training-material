This tutorial explains how to make your brand new tools, once they're published through a Pull Request ([check this tutorial]({%link topics/dev/tutorials/tool-from-scratch/tutorial.md %}) on how to build your tool from scracth), visible on your subdomain. Here we'll follow the example on how to make the tools visible on [Galaxy for earth System](https://earth-system.usegalaxy.eu/). You can also find the explanations on how to add your tools on this [Github page](https://usegalaxy-eu.github.io/operations/subdomains.html).

# Add your batch tool to the right section

> <hands-on-title>Tool sections (for batch tools) </hands-on-title>
>    - Clone the Github repository of the Galaxy server (of where your subdomain to be attached)
>    - For Galaxy Europe, fork the [usegalaxy-eu-tools repo](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/usegalaxy-eu-tools)
>    - Create a branch on your fork
>    - Browse through the different yaml files and select the one that correspond to your subdomain for earth system everything is made under the ecology owner.  The name of the files corresponds to a toolshed owner or community and a few of those communities with a review system and CI integration gets special trust and auto-updates.
>    - Once in the yaml you can add the section for your tool (you want to know what are the existing tool sections ? Go check the [categories defined here](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/blob/master/templates/galaxy/config/tool_conf.xml.j2)) 
> 
> An example on how to fill in the yaml file
> ```
> - name: id_of_your_tool
>   owner: choose_the_owner_relative_to_a_github_repo
>   tool_panel_section_label: 'Choose the section where your tool belongs'
> ```
>

>    - Create a branch on your fork
>    - Go to the file **global_host_filters.py.j2** in **templates/galaxy/config/**
>    - Open it and edit it the "DOMAIN_SECTIONS" part go to your subdomain line and in the list of section add the one you need for instance `"climate_analysis"`

>    - If not already done clone the Galaxy Europe [Infrastructure-playbook repo](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/tree/master)
>    - Create a branch on your fork
>    - Go to the file **tool_conf.xml.j2** in **templates/galaxy/config/**
>    - Open it and edit it by adding the xml file of the interactive tool to the section interactive tool or any other interactive tool section (to know more on how to create your interactive tool section folow [this tutorial]({%link topics/admin/tutorials/subdomain/tutorial.md %}))
>    - Below an example of how to add the interactive tool panoply to the earth system subdomain.
