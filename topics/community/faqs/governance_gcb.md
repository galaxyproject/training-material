The Galaxy Community Board provides a supportive virtual forum for the exchange of ideas, and a governance body to represent [**Special Interest Groups** (SIGs)](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/) in Galaxy.

The goals of the GCB are to:

 - share resources, tips & best practices to make running **SIGs** easier;
 - discuss scientist (user) feedback to help guide Galaxy platform development;
 - communicate scientist (user) needs to the Galaxy Governance structure; and
 - develop proposals to advance scientist (user) goals in the Galaxy community.
