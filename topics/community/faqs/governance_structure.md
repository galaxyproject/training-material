Galaxy Governance consists of a [Galaxy Executive Board](https://galaxyproject.org/community/governance/geb/) that provides global direction, working with a [Galaxy Technical Board](https://galaxyproject.org/community/governance/gtb/) that represents [Working Groups](https://galaxyproject.org/community/wg/) and a [Galaxy Community Board](https://galaxyproject.org/community/governance/gcb/) that represents [Special Interest Groups](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/).

![Galaxy Executive Board is in a rectangle over top of two rectangles, the Galaxy Technical Board and Galaxy Community Board, which are themselves over top of Working Groups and Special Interest Groups, respectively. A Project Management Office rectangle spans the image across the bottom]( {% link topics/community/images/structure.png %} "Galaxy Community Governance" )
