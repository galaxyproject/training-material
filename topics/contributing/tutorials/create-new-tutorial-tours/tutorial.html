The idea was to develop something open and online based on a community effort, as always in Galaxy.",

                <p>Galaxy is a great solution to train the bioinformatics concepts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>numerous bioinformatics tools are available (almost 5,000 in the ToolShed)</li>
  <li>it can be used by people without any computer science skills</li>
  <li>it trains to use technology, outlining available resources and efforts that have made them accessible to researchers</li>
  <li>it is scalable</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2016, the Galaxy Training Network decide to set up a new infrastructure for delivering easily Galaxy related training material. The idea was to develop something open and online based on a community effort, as most of the time in Galaxy.</p>

<p>We take inspiration from <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>. We collected everything on a GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material">https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material </a>. We decided a structure based on tutorials with hands-on, fitting both for online self-training but also for workshops, grouped in topics. Each tutorial follows the same structure and comes with a technical support to be able to run.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will understand how to design and develop a new tutorial fitting in this training material repository. As doing helps to understand, we will develop a small tutorial to explain BLAST with the full infrastructure to be able to run this tutorial anywhere.</p>

<h1 id="a-galaxy-interactive-tour">A Galaxy Interactive Tour</h1>

<p>A Galaxy Interactive Tour is a way to go through an entire analysis, step by step inside Galaxy in an interactive and explorative way. It is a great pedagogic way to run the tutorial directly inside Galaxy.</p>

<figure id="figure-1" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../../dev/images/galaxy_tour_demo.gif" alt="Demonstration of an Interactive Tour.

<p>A tour is a YAML file like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>id: galaxy_ui

description: A gentle introduction to the Galaxy User Interface
title_default: "Welcome to Galaxy"

steps:
    - title: "Welcome to Galaxy"
      content: "This short tour will guide you through Galaxy's user interface.&lt;br&gt;
                You can navigate with your arrow keys and leave the tour at any time point
                with 'Escape' or the 'End tour' button."
      backdrop: true

    - title: "Upload your data"
      element: ".upload-button"
      intro: "Galaxy supports many ways to get in your data.&lt;br&gt;
              Use this button to upload your data."
      position: "right"
      postclick:
        - ".upload-button"
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>at the top some metadata related to the Tour:
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id</code>: ID of the tour</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code>: name of the tour</li>

      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title_default</code>: a title</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>several steps corresponding to the different boxes</p>

    <p>Each step is beginning with a dash <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> and with possible arguments</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>

<p>The YAML file of a tour can be integrated in a Galaxy instance by placing the YAML file in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/plugins/tours</code> directory of the Galaxy code and restarting the Galaxy instance</p>

<h1 id="creating-a-galaxy-interactive-tour">Creating a Galaxy Interactive Tour</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/TailorDev/galaxy-tourbuilder">A Web browser plugin</a> is available to help the creation and the test (on the fly) of an interactive tour.</p>
