We'll use some ggplot and tidyverse code to plot the data we collected in part 1

We'll use tidyverse (which includes things like magrittr (`%>%`) and ggplot2) to load our data. Reshape2 provides the cast/melt functions which can be used to reshape specific datasets into formats that are easier to plot.

```R
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape2)
# This path will probably need to be changed depending on where you downloaded that dataset.
data = read_tsv("sc.tsv")
```

## Data Cleaning

Let's start by cleaning our data a bit. We've got a couple problems with it:

- there might be some null mergedAt dates, we'll want to remove those
- we probably want to ignore a couple of classes of datasets that were added/removed (images, and the explicit 'ignore' type.)

```R
clean = data %>% 
	select(num, class, additions, deletions, mergedAt) %>% 
	filter(!is.na(mergedAt)) %>% 
	group_by(num, class, mergedAt, month=floor_date(mergedAt, 'month'), quarter=floor_date(mergedAt, 'quarter')) %>% 
	summarise(additions=sum(additions), deletions=-sum(deletions)) %>%
	filter(class != "ignore") %>%
	filter(class != "image") %>%
	arrange(mergedAt) %>%
	as_tibble()
```

We'll setup a 'theme' for our plot that mainly consists of using the black and white theme which is quite elegant and readable, and then making some font sizes a wee bit larger:

```R
theme = theme_bw() + theme(
  axis.text=element_text(size=14), 
  plot.title=element_text(size=18), 
  axis.title=element_text(size=16),
  legend.title=element_text(size=14),
  legend.text=element_text(size=14))
```

We want all of our plots to look the same which is why we use this trick, it helps us keep a consistent aesthetic without having to re-type the configuration every single time.

Let's get to plotting!

## Plot: Lines added/removed by date/time period

We have a dataset that looks like:

```R
clean %>% head(10)
```

We'll want to plot the changes versus the time (either quarter or month), and
then maybe plot them differently based on the class of the addition/removal. So that translates into an aesthetics statement like `aes(x=time, y=additions, fill=class)`

In ggplot2 you can plot data some different ways, if you provide the datasets upfront, e.g. `data %>% ggplot()` you'll generally do something like `data %>% ggplot(aes(x=a, y=b)) + geom_something()` and `geom_something` will take the data from the ggplot call. However if you want to plot multiple series, you can also provide the data directly to the `geom_*` functions like so:

```R
ggplot() +
  geom_col(data=clean, aes(x=quarter, y=additions, fill=class)) +
  geom_col(data=clean, aes(x=quarter, y=deletions, fill=class)) + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  geom_point(data=clean, aes(x=mergedAt, y=0), shape=3, alpha=0.3, color="black") +
  theme +
  xlab("Quarter") + ylab("Lines added or removed") + guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Category")) +
  ggtitle("Lines added or removed by file type across GTN Single Cell Learning Materials")
ggsave("sc-lines-by-quarter.png", width=12, height=5)

ggplot() +
  geom_col(data=clean, aes(x=month, y=additions, fill=class)) + 
  geom_col(data=clean, aes(x=month, y=deletions, fill=class)) + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  theme +
  geom_point(data=clean, aes(x=mergedAt, y=0), shape=3, alpha=0.3, color="black") +
  xlab("Month") + ylab("Lines added or removed") + guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Category")) +
  ggtitle("Lines added or removed by file type across GTN Single Cell Learning Materials") 
ggsave("sc-lines-by-month.png", width=12, height=5)
```

![very inconsistent lines added by quarter some quarters have more and some have less but it is mostly workflow and then tutorial lines being added or removed.](./images/sc-lines-by-quarter.png)

In this case we plotted the data for additions and deletions separately, and we additionally added points based on the actual date of the PRs to visualise their density.


Let's produce @gtn:nomadscientist's favourite running sum plots in addition. We'll start by reshaping our data. Currently we have data that looks like:

time | variable | value
-- | --- | ---
today | measure1 | 1
today | measure2 | 10
yesterday | measure1 | 30
yesterday | measure2 | 5

And we'll re-shape this to look like this, which will make it easier to calculate changes over the course of a specific series:

time | measure1 | measure2
--- | --- | ---
today | 1 | 10
yesterday | 30 | 5


We'll use the `dcast` function to do that:

```
clean %>% select(month, class, additions)  %>% dcast(month ~ class, value.var="additions") %>% head()
```

That doesn't look quite right so, let's change how the data is aggregated:

```R
# cumulative
clean %>% select(month, class, additions)  %>% dcast(month ~ class, value.var="additions", fun.aggregate = sum)
```

Let's do it for real now:

```R
cumulative = clean %>% select(month, class, additions)  %>% 
  dcast(month ~ class, value.var="additions", fun.aggregate = sum) %>%
  mutate(across(bibliography:workflows, cumsum)) %>% 
  reshape2::melt(id.var="month")

cumulative %>% ggplot(aes(x=month, y=value, color=variable)) + geom_line() + 
  theme_bw() + theme +
  xlab("Month") + ylab("Lines added") + guides(color=guide_legend(title="Category")) +
  ggtitle("Cumulative lines added by category, across GTN Single Cell materials")
ggsave("sc-lines-cumulative.png", width=12, height=8)
```

![workflows and tutorials are the highest with on the order of 25k lines added, it used to be quite jagged with code being thrown over the wall but now it's rather smooth with consistent constant updates.](./images/sc-lines-cumulative.png)

## Contributions over time

Let's again start with some cleaning, namely removing all rows with 0 records, and removing future records (at the time of writing.)

```R
roles = read_tsv("sc-roles.tsv")
w = roles %>% 
  filter(count != 0) %>% 
  filter(!grepl("2025", date)) %>%
  filter(!grepl("2024-12-01", date))

w %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=count, color=area)) + 
  theme +
  xlab("Date") + ylab("Unique Contributors") + guides(color=guide_legend(title="Contribution Area")) +
  ggtitle("Contributors over time to GTN Single Cell Materials") +
  geom_line()
ggsave("sc-contribs.png", width=12, height=6)
```

![plot of several lines increasing over time in a very discrete way, authorship remains highest](./images/sc-contribs.png)

## New X over Time

Let's plot all of the new single cell things added over time, all the new FAQs, Tutorials, Slides, Etc:

```R
added_by_time = read_tsv("single-cell-over-time.tsv")
added_by_time %>% dcast(date ~ `type`) %>% 
  arrange(date) %>% 
  mutate(across(event:workflow, cumsum)) %>% 
  melt(id.var="date") %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% arrange(date) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=value, color=variable)) + geom_line() + 
  theme_bw() + theme +
  xlab("Date") + ylab("New Single Cell Items") + guides(color=guide_legend(title="Contribution Type")) +
  ggtitle("New Single Cell events, FAQs, news, slides, tutorials, videos and workflows in the GTN")
ggsave("sc-files-cumulative.png", width=6, height=6)
```

We may also want to know how many changes there have been since the start date of this study, e.g. October 1st, 2020:

```R
since_oct = added_by_time %>% dcast(date ~ `type`) %>% 
  arrange(date) %>% 
  mutate(across(event:workflow, cumsum)) %>% 
  filter(date > as.Date("2020-10-01"))

# Pull out the first/last date as our start ane dnwend
start_date = (since_oct %>% head(n=1))$date
end_date = (since_oct %>% tail(n=1))$date

# Table of our changes.
since_oct %>% 
  filter(date == start_date | date == end_date) %>%  # Just those rows
  mutate(date = case_when(date == start_date ~ 'start', date == end_date ~ 'end')) %>% # Relabel the start/end as literal string start and end
  pivot_longer(-date) %>% pivot_wider(names_from=date, values_from=value) %>% # Transpose the data
  mutate(increase=end - start) %>% # And calculate our increase
  select(name, increase) %>% arrange(-increase)
```

## Pageviews

GTN uses the Galaxy Europe Plausible server for collecting metrics (you can change your preferences in [your GTN privacy preferences]({% link user/privacy.md %})).
We can download the data from the server and plot it, filtering by our preferred start/end dates and filters (namely that page includes `/topics/single-cell/`).
Unfortunately the data is downloaded as a zip file which we'll then need to extract data from:

```R
system("wget 'https://plausible.galaxyproject.eu/training.galaxyproject.org/export?period=custom&date=2024-11-07&from=2022-08-01&to=2024-11-07&filters=%7B%22page%22%3A%22~%2Ftopics%2Fsingle-cell%2F%22%7D&with_imported=true&interval=date' -O sc-stats.zip")
```

We can use the unzip function to read a single file directly from the zip:

```R
views = read_csv(unzip("sc-stats.zip", "visitors.csv"))
```

With that we're ready to plot. We're going to use a new feature for our plot,
`annotate`. Annotation allows you to draw arbitrary features atop your plot, in
this case we're going to draw rectangles to indicate outages and events that
might have affected our data.

```R
y = 3300
xoff = 3
views %>% group_by(date=floor_date(date, 'week')) %>% 
  summarise(date, visitors=sum(visitors), pageviews=sum(pageviews)) %>% 
  filter(visitors != 0 | pageviews != 0) %>%
  melt(id.var="date")  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=value, color=variable)) + geom_line() + 
  annotate("rect", xmin = as.Date("2023-10-01"), xmax = as.Date("2023-10-27"), ymin = 0, ymax = y,  alpha = .2) + # Outage
  annotate("rect", xmin = as.Date("2023-05-22") - xoff, xmax = as.Date("2023-05-26") - xoff, ymin = 0, ymax = y,  alpha = .2) + # Smorg3
  annotate("rect", xmin = as.Date("2024-10-07") - xoff, xmax = as.Date("2024-10-11") - xoff, ymin = 0, ymax = y,  alpha = .2) + # GTA
  annotate("rect", xmin = as.Date("2024-09-16") - xoff, xmax = as.Date("2024-09-20") - xoff, ymin = 0, ymax = y,  alpha = .2) + # Bootcamp
  theme_bw() + theme +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, NA)) +
  xlab("Date") + ylab("Count") + guides(color=guide_legend(title="Metric")) +
  ggtitle("GTN Single Cell Visits")
ggsave("sc-pageviews.png", width=14, height=4)
```

for our lovely pageview plot!
