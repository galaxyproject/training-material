You can now focus just on the code and reading within RStudio.</p>   <ol>   <li>     <p><strong>Load the notebook</strong> if you have not already, following the tip box at the top of the tutorial</p>     <p><img src="/training-material/topics/data-science/images/rstudio/r-download-file.png" alt="Screenshot of the Console in RStudio.

There is some yaml metadata above the tutorial showing the title of the tutorial." /></p>   </li> </ol>   <p>You’re now ready to view the RMarkdown notebook! Each notebook starts with a lot of metadata about how to build the notebook for viewing, but you can ignore this for now and <strong>scroll down to the content of the tutorial</strong>.</p>   <p>You can switch to the visual mode which is way easier to read - just click on the gear icon and select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Use Visual Editor</code>.</p>   <p><img src="/training-material/topics/data-science/images/rstudio/r-visual-mode.png" alt="Screenshot of dropdown menu after clicking on the gear icon. The first option is `Use Visual Editor`." /></p>   <p>You’ll see codeblocks scattered throughout the text, and these are all runnable snippets that appear like this in the document:</p>   <p><img src="/training-material/topics/data-science/images/rstudio/r-run-cell.png" alt="Screenshot of the RMarkdown document in the viewer, a cell is visible between markdown text reading library tidyverse. It is slightly more grey than the background region, and it has a run button at the right of the cell in a contextual menu." /></p>   <p>And you have a few options for how to run them:</p>   <ol>   <li>Click the green arrow</li>   <li><kbd>ctrl+enter</kbd></li>   <li>     <p>Using the menu at the top to run all</p>     <p><img src="/training-material/topics/data-science/images/rstudio/r-run-all.png" alt="Screenshot of the run dropdown menu in R, the first item is run selected lines showing the mentioned shortcut above, the second is run next chunk, and then it also mentions a 'run all chunks below' and 'restart r and run all chunks' option." /></p>   </li> </ol>   <p>When you run cells, the output will appear below in the Console. RStudio essentially copies the code from the RMarkdown document, to the console, and runs it, just as if you had typed it out yourself!</p>   <p><img src="/training-material/topics/data-science/images/rstudio/r-cell-output.png" alt="Screenshot of a run cell, its output is included below in the RMarkdown document and the same output is visible below in the console. It shows a log of loading the tidyverse library." /></p>   <p>One of the best features of RMarkdown documents is that they include a very nice table browser which makes previewing results a lot easier! Instead of needing to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code> every time to preview the result, you get an interactive table browser for any step which outputs a table.</p>   <p><img src="/training-material/topics/data-science/images/rstudio/r-table.png" alt="Screenshot of the table browser. Below a code chunk is a large white area with two images, the first reading 'r console' and the second reading 'tbl_df'. The tbl_df is highlighted like it is active. Below that is a pretty-printed table with bold column headers like name and genus and so on. At the right of the table is a small arrow indicating you can switch to seeing more columns than just the initial three. At the bottom of the table is 1-10 of 83 rows written, and buttons for switching between each page of results." /></p> </blockquote> <!--END_SNIPPET-->

<p>We’ll use tidyverse (which includes things like magrittr (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%&gt;%</code>) and ggplot2) to load our data. Reshape2 provides the cast/melt functions which can be used to reshape specific datasets into formats that are easier to plot.</p>

<p>Let’s start by cleaning our data a bit. We’ve got a couple problems with it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there might be some null mergedAt dates, we’ll want to remove those</li>
  <li>we probably want to ignore a couple of classes of datasets that were added/removed (images, and the explicit ‘ignore’ type.)</li>

<p>We’ll setup a ‘theme’ for our plot that mainly consists of using the black and white theme which is quite elegant and readable, and then making some font sizes a wee bit larger:</p>

<div class="language-R highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">theme</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">theme_bw</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">theme</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="w">

  </span><span class="n">plot.title</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">element_text</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">size</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">18</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"> 
  </span><span class="n">axis.title</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">element_text</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">size</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">16</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w">

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We want all of our plots to look the same which is why we use this trick, it helps us keep a consistent aesthetic without having to re-type the configuration every single time.</p>

<p>Let’s get to plotting!</p>

<h2 id="plot-lines-addedremoved-by-datetime-period">Plot: Lines added/removed by date/time period</h2>

<p>We have a dataset that looks like:</p>

<div class="language-R highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">clean</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">%&gt;%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">head</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">10</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll want to plot the changes versus the time (either quarter or month), and
then maybe plot them differently based on the class of the addition/removal. So that translates into an aesthetics statement like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aes(x=time, y=additions, fill=class)</code></p>

<p>In ggplot2 you can plot data some different ways, if you provide the datasets upfront, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data %&gt;% ggplot()</code> you’ll generally do something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=a, y=b)) + geom_something()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">geom_something</code> will take the data from the ggplot call. However if you want to plot multiple series, you can also provide the data directly to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">geom_*</code> functions like so:</p>

<p>In this case we plotted the data for additions and deletions separately, and we additionally added points based on the actual date of the PRs to visualise their density.</p>

<p>Let’s produce <a href="/training-material/hall-of-fame/nomadscientist/" class="contributor-badge-inline contributor-nomadscientist">

‘s favourite running sum plots in addition. We’ll start by reshaping our data. Currently we have data that looks like:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>time</th>
      <th>variable</th>
      <th>value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>today</td>
      <td>measure1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>today</td>
      <td>measure2</td>
      <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>yesterday</td>
      <td>measure1</td>
      <td>30</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>yesterday</td>
      <td>measure2</td>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>And we’ll re-shape this to look like this, which will make it easier to calculate changes over the course of a specific series:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>time</th>
      <th>measure1</th>
      <th>measure2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>today</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>yesterday</td>
      <td>30</td>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We’ll use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dcast</code> function to do that:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>clean %&gt;% select(month, class, additions)  %&gt;% dcast(month ~ class, value.var="additions") %&gt;% head()
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="pageviews">Pageviews</h2>

<p>GTN uses the Galaxy Europe Plausible server for collecting metrics (you can change your preferences in <a href="/training-material/user/privacy.html">your GTN privacy preferences</a>).
We can download the data from the server and plot it, filtering by our preferred start/end dates and filters (namely that page includes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/topics/single-cell/</code>).
Unfortunately the data is downloaded as a zip file which we’ll then need to extract data from:</p>

<div class="language-R highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">system</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"wget 'https://plausible.galaxyproject.eu/training.galaxyproject.org/export?period=custom&amp;date=2024-11-07&amp;from=2022-08-01&amp;to=2024-11-07&amp;filters=%7B%22page%22%3A%22~%2Ftopics%2Fsingle-cell%2F%22%7D&amp;with_imported=true&amp;interval=date' -O sc-stats.zip"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can use the unzip function to read a single file directly from the zip:</p>

<div class="language-R highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">views</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">read_csv</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">unzip</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"sc-stats.zip"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"visitors.csv"</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>With that we’re ready to plot. We’re going to use a new feature for our plot,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">annotate</code>. Annotation allows you to draw arbitrary features atop your plot, in
this case we’re going to draw rectangles to indicate outages and events that
might have affected our data.</p>
