<p>Without realizing it, GitHub let you create your first branch (named here <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">patch-1</code>) and add a changement on this branch.</p>

<blockquote class="comment">
  <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-branching"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment: Branching</div>
  <p>Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time. By default your repository has one branch named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> which is considered to be the definitive branch. When you create a branch off the main branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> as it was at that point in time.</p>

  <p>By changing a file in this branch, it will diverge from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> branch. It will contain data that is only on this new branch.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="open-a-pull-request">Open a Pull Request</h1>

<p>Then the addition of your information in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CONTRIBUTORS.yaml</code> file is currently only on your branch <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">patch-1</code>. Not on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> branch and so not only on the <a href="/training-material/hall-of-fame.html">Hall of Fame</a>. You can’t add or push directly to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> branch, so you need to create what we call a pull request.</p>

<p>The GitHub interface guides you through this process: after clicking on <strong>Propose file change</strong>, a new page opens:</p>

<p>Great! You now know how to make pull request on GitHub, and how to make changes after a review.
Reviewers can now approve and merge your pull request.</p>

<p>Because this was just a practice pull request, let’s close it again.</p>
