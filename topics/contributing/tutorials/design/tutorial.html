                <p><strong>Teaching and training</strong>, core elements of academic life, can be enormously
rewarding but also quite challenging. Instructors are often required to perform
under various constraints, and frequently have to accommodate, engage and
motivate student cohorts with very different backgrounds and aptitudes in
limited time-frames. This can be daunting for experienced teachers, but
especially so for those who’re relatively new to teaching and training.</p>

learning takes place: e.g., a lecture, game, exercise, role-play, etc.</p>

  <p><strong>Teaching Goal (TG)</strong>: the intentions of an instructor regarding the purpose

</blockquote>

<p>Emphasis is placed on teaching and learning, and mechanisms for collecting
evidence that learners have changed over time
(<span class="citation"><a href="#tractenberg2020guidelines">Tractenberg <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>). In this latter sense, the concept of
‘curriculum’ differentiates formal teaching from training, as formal programmes
usually afford time for learners both to be able to progress and to <strong>demonstrate
their progression</strong>.</p>

<p>By contrast, training courses are much shorter (measured in days or weeks,
rather than years); they hence necessarily focus on acquiring specific KSAs in
limited time-frames, generally without consideration of learner progression
beyond the course. However, the essential features of <strong>effective curricula</strong>
(i.e., those that achieve their stated LOs for the majority of learners) pertain
to instruction on any time-scale; they are thus also relevant for short courses,
and provide important considerations for those involved in, or embarking upon,
course design (whether face-to-face or online).</p>

<p>With this in mind, this tutorial outlines key steps of curriculum development –
and the role of Bloom’s taxonomy (<span class="citation"><a href="#bloom1956taxonomy">Bloom 1956</a></span>) – that can be
used to inform the design of effective courses.</p>

<h1 id="formal-curriculum-design">Formal curriculum design</h1>

<h2 id="different-types-of-curriculum">Different types of curriculum</h2>

<p>To set the scene for our considerations of course design, we examine some of the
foundations for effective curriculum development, drawing heavily on the
curriculum- and course- development guidelines developed by
<span class="citation"><a href="#tractenberg2020guidelines">Tractenberg <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>. Notable here is the fact that different
types of curriculum have been defined: <em>i.e.</em>, <strong>intended</strong>, <strong>implemented</strong>,
<strong>attained</strong> and <strong>hidden curricula</strong>. Recognising the existence of different
curriculum types (or, perhaps, different curricular outcomes) is important
because, while the intended curriculum is the starting point, it may not be the
curriculum actually attained: <em>i.e.</em>, what you aimed to teach and what students
actually learned may not be the same.</p>

<p>To improve outcomes, differences between the intended and attained curricula
need to be minimised. The only way to discover the attained curriculum is to
find out what learning actually occurred. This requires <strong>actionable</strong>
evaluation, to assess whether the teaching goals (TGs) and learning outcomes (LOs) were achieved, to identify
weaknesses in the implementation and to highlight improvements needed to
remediate them. These considerations are key to developing effective curricula
and courses.</p>

<h2 id="structuring-curriculum-design">Structuring curriculum design</h2>

<p>Curriculum design benefits from being systematic: structured approaches help to
orchestrate and clarify what will be taught, <strong>why it will be taught</strong> and how;
they also afford opportunities to evaluate what does and doesn’t work, and hence
what needs to change, ultimately leading to improvements in learning outcomes
(<span class="citation"><a href="#fink2013creating">Fink 2013</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#diamond2008designing">Diamond 2008</a></span>,
<span class="citation"><a href="#nilson2016teaching">Nilson 2016</a></span>). Several different frameworks have been devised to
facilitate the design process, but each is motivated by the same underlying
philosophy: to help formulate programmes that promote <strong>meaningful and enduring
learning</strong>. If we’re to understand whether we’ve really achieved this, we must</p>

<ol>
  <li>determine the purpose of the programme (what needs it addresses, why it’s
being developed, what learners will gain from it, why it’s important),</li>
  <li>define the intended LOs, and</li>
  <li>develop <strong>assessment</strong> and evaluation mechanisms that will allow us to
measure whether the programme successfully met its goals.</li>

</blockquote>

<p>Not surprisingly, the same principles apply to course design. The process may
seem daunting, but for the sake of simplicity, we focus here on one model: <em>i.e.</em>,
that proposed by <span class="citation"><a href="#nicholls2002developing">Nicholls 2002</a></span>. Before discussing
this further, however, it’s helpful to consider another very important tool used
in teaching and learning – Bloom’s taxonomy (<span class="citation"><a href="#bloom1956taxonomy">Bloom 1956</a></span>).</p>

<h3 id="blooms-taxonomy-of-cognitive-complexity">Bloom’s taxonomy of cognitive complexity</h3>

<p>Learning taxonomies are useful tools that can help both to formulate and clarify
LOs, and to arrange them on a scale of increasing complexity. Bloom’s taxonomy
(<span class="citation"><a href="#bloom1956taxonomy">Bloom 1956</a></span>), probably the most easily understood and widely
used today, features a <strong>six-level hierarchy of cognitive complexity</strong>, ranging
from <strong>Remember</strong> (being able to recall facts and basic concepts) to <strong>Evaluate</strong>
being able to defend opinions or decisions), as illustrated in the following
figure:</p>

<figure id="figure-1" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="images/bloom_taxonomy.png" alt="6 levels of Bloom's taxonomy (and their verbs) from bottom (lower-order thinking skills) to top (higher-order 'critical' thinking skills): Remember (recall or reiterate information) with memorize, recognise, identify, describe, reproduce, list, define, label, name, state, outline, order, arrange; Understand (demonstrate understanding of facts) with distinguish, classify, select, review, discuss, indicate, explain, estimate, locate, summarise; Apply (apply knowledge to real situations) with operate, manipulate, experiment, choose, modify, prepare, produce; Analyze (resolve ideas into simple parts, identify patterns) with calculate, examine, model, test, break down, infer, predict, solve; Synthesise (pull ideas into a coherent whole, create new ideas) with combine, formulate, illustrate, imagine, design, invent, compose; Evaluate (make &amp; defend judgements, assess theories &amp; outcomes) with critique, compare ideas, solve, recommend, rate. " width="1090" height="536" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="images/bloom_taxonomy.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> Bloom’s taxonomy of cognitive complexity, &amp; a sample of associated verbs that can be used to create LOs. The verbs reflect a developmental trajectory, from lower- to higher-order thinking skills; they should be concretely observable &amp; relate to how achievement of target LOs will be assessed. Source: <span class="citation"><a href="#via2020course">Via <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span></figcaption></figure>

<p>As can be seen from the figure, each Bloom’s level is accompanied by a set of
active verbs that express expected, measurable learner behaviours at that level:
<em>e.g.</em>, achieving the level <strong>Understand</strong> means to be able to classify, select or
explain a piece of information: here, <em>classify, select, explain</em> are
observable, assessable behaviours that can be readily encapsulated in coherent
LOs.</p>

<p>Typical illustrations of the taxonomy, like that in the figure, depict
successive cognitive levels, suggesting that learners must achieve one level
before advancing to the next, implying a <strong>developmental trajectory</strong> from lower-
to higher-order cognitive skills. However, this structure should not be regarded
as completely rigid; indeed, <span class="citation"><a href="#anderson2001taxonomy">Anderson <i>et al.</i> 2001</a></span> published a revised
version in 2001 in which they placed <strong>Synthesise</strong> (the ability to create new or
original work) at the top of the hierarchy in place of <strong>Evaluate</strong>.
Notwithstanding the minutiae, it is perhaps more fruitful to regard the taxonomy
as a continuum or spectrum of cognitive levels, where each merges into the next,
providing a structured tool to help express measurable, assessable LOs, in which
the cognitive levels are made explicit.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we can use Bloom’s taxonomy to <strong>align instruction with learners’ levels of complexity of thinking</strong> (and experience). In practice, you can use the Bloom’s levels of cognitive complexity (and the <a href="https://tips.uark.edu/blooms-taxonomy-verb-chart/">accompanied actionable verbs in the previous link</a>) to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>write Learning Outcomes</li>
  <li>design instruction and learning experiences i.e. how you are to teach/train, which infrastructure and how to present the materials etc</li>
  <li>assess learning (taking place during curricula or course and after)</li>
</ul>

<p>The cognitive aspects embodied in LOs are important. Teaching should promote
more complex behaviours than just recall or recognition (unless remembering is
the intended LO), and push learners to achieve greater cognitive complexity
(<span class="citation"><a href="#nilson2016teaching">Nilson 2016</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#ambrose2010learning">Ambrose <i>et al.</i> 2010</a></span>,

<span class="citation"><a href="#jensen2014teaching">Jensen <i>et al.</i> 2014</a></span>). This can be done by embedding development in
learning activities and materials, and ensuring that LOs reflect the lowest to
the highest levels of cognitive complexity realistically achievable on
completing those activities or having engaged with those materials (realistic
aims are key, especially for short courses: <em>e.g.</em>, expecting learners with no
prior subject knowledge to achieve the level <strong>Evaluate</strong>, say in a 1-day course,
will guarantee failure and frustration for learners and instructors alike).</p>

<h1 id="nicholls-five-phases-of-curriculum-design">Nicholl’s five phases of curriculum design</h1>

<p>The backdrop for our considerations of course design is Nicholls’ paradigm for
curriculum development, illustrated in:</p>

For each phase, key considerations are shown (diamonds). Where these are not satisfied, that or previous phases should be revisited (red arrows), otherwise it is safe to move to the next phase(s) (green arrows). When all considerations are satisfied, the curriculum or course can be characterised, with concrete evidence, as successful (star). By simplified we mean that here you only see the arrows going from one box to the following in line. However, usually we need to revise and go back one or several boxes if we have failed to specify or articulated Learning outcomes from the beginning. This is what we mean by Learning Outcomes drives the whole process. Source: <span class="citation"><a href="#via2020course">Via <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span></figcaption></figure>

<p>Its five-phase structure has been briefly summarised by
<span class="citation"><a href="#tractenberg2020guidelines">Tractenberg <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>, as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select LOs;</li>
  <li>Select or develop LEs that will help learners achieve the LOs;</li>
  <li>Select or develop content relevant to LOs;</li>
  <li>Develop assessments to ensure learners progress toward LOs;</li>
  <li>Evaluate the effectiveness of LEs for leading learners to LOs.</li>
</ol>

<p>As can be seen from <a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a>, the model’s phases are interdependent; all are
ultimately dependent on the first – defining LOs. Moreover, the phases are
iterative: this means that LOs influence later decisions, but later decisions
may also reflect backwards, thereby providing opportunities to check for
alignment of each phase to the target LOs (in other words, to ensure that
successive phases are mutually consistent with, and supportive of, the LOs).
Thus, the role of LOs is pivotal: they must have specific characteristics to
function, and support each of the other phases as they do.</p>

<p><a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a> illuminates an important feature of the model: that <strong>LOs are the
starting point, and drive all decision-making</strong>. This is just as true for courses
as it is for programmes (<span class="citation"><a href="#diamond2008designing">Diamond 2008</a></span>). Missing from the model,
however, is the dependence of LOs on a hierarchy of cognitive complexity that
establishes a developmental trajectory, like that seen in Bloom’s taxonomy. We
reflect on this crucial point, and its relevance for course design, in the
discussion of each of the five phases below.</p>

<h2 id="define-intended-learning-outcomes-los">Define intended Learning Outcomes (LOs)</h2>

<p>Just as for curricula, Phase 1 of course design begins with stating the LOs. To
help formulate LOs, it’s important to take a step back and think about what you
aim to achieve (i.e., what are your TGs and the KSAs you intend to be achieved?),
how you propose to get there, and how you’ll know you succeeded.
<span class="citation"><a href="#messick1994interplay">Messick 1994</a></span> encapsulated this process in the form of three
succinct questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What KSAs are the targets of instruction (and assessment)?</li>
  <li>What learner actions/behaviours will reveal these KSAs?</li>
  <li>What tasks will elicit these specific actions or behaviours?</li>
</ol>

<p>These questions were originally posed in 1994 in the context of assessment.
Their focus on KSAs – the LOs – thus guides not only the creation of relevant
tasks (to reveal the target KSAs) but also the rational development of
<strong>appropriate</strong> assessments: i.e., they provide a framework for, and clarify,
<strong>what to assess</strong>. The questions can thus support all phases of course
development, starting with the selection of intended KSAs stated in a set of
LOs.</p>

<p>The “Learning outcomes” (LOs) are essentially statements that tell what the learners will be to do at the end of the session. For this reason, every well-designed training should start with LOs.</p>

<p>The first step of good instructional design consists is identifying the set of Knowledge, Skills, Abilities (KSAs) that learners are expected to acquire by the end of instruction.</p>

<h3 id="teaching-objectives-and-learning-outcomes">Teaching objectives and Learning Outcomes</h3>

<p><strong>Objectives</strong> are statements of what you are setting out to teach, although expressed as if the students were going to learn it. Despite Aims are usually intended to be more general and encompassing than Objectives, they are essential the same.</p>

<p><strong>Outcomes</strong> (more accurately “desired outcomes”) are statements of what you might (in principle) assess. You may not end up assessing all of them, but they are statements of what a student will know or be able to do, if she or he has learned everything in the course or session.</p>

<blockquote class="comment">
  <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-sources-1"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment: Sources</div>

  <p>The following section is adapted from the webpage <a href="http://provost.rpi.edu/learning-assessment/learning-outcomes/objectives-vs-outcomes">http://provost.rpi.edu/learning-assessment/learning-outcomes/objectives-vs-outcomes</a> and the <a href="https://irds.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj10071/f/clo.pdf">Operational definitions:</a> document from the <a href="http://provost.rpi.edu/institutional-research">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Office of the Provost</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The terms Learning Objectives and Learning Outcomes are often used interchangeably by the community. Even worse, they are often abbreviated by the acronym (LO), thus introducing even more ambiguity. In our opinion there is no need. Objectives (aims or goals) and Outcomes (results) may overlap, but are not genuinely the same.</p>

<p>Furthermore, American educational psychologists tend to use “Learning Objectives” to mean “Learning Outcomes” and “Teaching aims, goals or objectives” to mean “Learning Objectives”.</p>

<p>In the attempt of removing ambiguities we will use the term <strong>Teaching Objectives</strong> to mean:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Objectives describe the goals and intentions of the instructor.</li>
  <li>Objectives, often termed the input in the course, state the purpose and goals of the course.</li>
  <li>Objectives focus on content and skills important within the classroom or programme.</li>
  <li>Objectives may describe what the instructors will do.</li>
  <li>Objectives can often be numerous, specific, and detailed.</li>
</ul>

<p>And the term <strong>Learning Outcomes</strong> to mean:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Student Learning Outcomes catalog the overarching “products” of the course and are the evidence that the goals or objectives were achieved.</li>
  <li>Learning Outcomes are statements that describe or list measurable and essential mastered content-knowledge—reflecting skills, competencies, and knowledge that students have achieved and can demonstrate upon successfully completing a course.</li>
  <li>Outcomes express higher-level thinking skills that integrate course content and activities and can be observed as a behavior, skill, or discrete useable knowledge upon completing the
course.</li>
  <li>Outcomes are exactly what assessments are intended to show – specifically what the student will be able to do upon completing the course.</li>
  <li>An assessable outcome can be displayed or observed and evaluated against criteria.</li>
  <li>Outcomes are clear and measurable criteria for guiding the teaching, learning, and assessment process in the course.</li>
  <li>Statements expressing which KSAs learners will be able to demonstrate upon completion of a learning experience or a sequence of learning experiences</li>
  <li>What learners will be able to do for the end of instruction and the teacher / instructor can in principle evaluate</li>
</ul>

<p>Going beyond the definition however, a learning outcome needs to be also practical, i.e. there is a need to assign observable actions in order to let teacher assess them.</p>

<h4 id="how-to-write-learning-outcomes-using-observable-verbs">How to write learning outcomes using OBSERVABLE verbs</h4>

<p>In order to write learning outcomes, you can use the following scheme:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Think about what learners will be able to do by the end of instruction</li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the sentences:</p>

    <p><em>By the end of the lesson (session/course/instruction) the learner will be able to………</em></p>

    <p>OR</p>

    <p><em>The successful learner will be able to……</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>Replace dots with a verb that you can assess (name, explain, solve, distinguish, etc.).</li>
  <li>Avoid verbs that are open to many interpretations: appreciate, have faith in, know, learn, understand, believe</li>
  <li>Keep in mind that learning outcomes can be as specific as you want. You may even think about a different learning outcome for each task you assign to learners.</li>

<p>Given their detail and complexity, and the importance of aligning the
instructional inputs you devise with the outcomes for learners you intend, it
can be hard to know where to start. This possibly explains why it may feel
easier to begin developing a course by selecting its content rather than first
trying to understand its impact on student learning. Nevertheless, ensuring that
target LOs meet, or are consistent with, the characteristics outlined in the box

          <li>They are able explain it?</li>
          <li>They are able apply it?</li>
          <li>They are able demonstrate it?</li>
          <li>They are able to use it in solving problem?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>It would make more sense to ask: “What will learners be able to do to show they know the Pythagorean theorem?”</p>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, when defining LOs, the key question to ask is, are they SMART?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>S</strong>pecific / <strong>S</strong>imple</li>
  <li><strong>M</strong>easurable</li>
  <li><strong>A</strong>chievable / <strong>A</strong>ttainable</li>
  <li><strong>R</strong>ealistic / <strong>R</strong>elevant</li>
  <li><strong>T</strong>ime-bound / <strong>T</strong>ransferable</li>
</ul>

<p>If they do not satisfy this test, they should be revised; only when they meet
these criteria is it safe to progress to Phase 2, as shown in <a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a>.
SMART LOs will be the roadmap as we plan out instructional strategies, write the
content and <strong>create assessments</strong>.</p>

<p>Ultimately, <strong>LOs provide the necessary structure and context for decision-making
by instructors (and learners), hence their primary role in course design</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="select-les-that-will-lead-to-the-los">Select LEs that will lead to the LOs</h2>

<p>Phase 2 involves identifying the most appropriate LEs to lead learners to the
intended LOs. It is important to appreciate that different LEs can lead learners
to demonstrate different Bloom’s-level accomplishments: <em>e.g.</em>,</p>
<ul>
  <li>lectures differ from problem-sets – solving problems helps learners to work
with, and manipulate, information rather than passively listening to it;</li>
  <li>similarly, lab exercises differ from writing computer programs – writing
original code affords learners the opportunity to create something new rather
than simply following instructions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some example LEs are listed in Table 1, together with the Bloom’s level and the
kinds of TG (Teaching Goals) and LO that each may support.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Having defined SMART LOs in Phase 1, Phase 2 thus hinges on choosing the most
appropriate LEs to best lead learners towards them: if LOs include, for example,
being able to write a computer program, then the LEs must allow learners to
apply the knowledge they have acquired and to demonstrate that they’ve written a
piece of functional code: i.e., LEs and LOs must be aligned (if they are not,
this can lead directly to a gap between instructional inputs and intended
outcomes, which is one reason why course evaluation to detect such misalignments
is so crucial). If LEs don’t satisfy this criterion, alternative LEs should be
found, or the LOs should be revisited and revised before progressing to Phase 3
(as shown in Figure 2).</p>

<p>Sometimes, it may be necessary to use specific LEs: e.g., if a course is
lecture-based, it may not be possible to choose alternatives; or a particular
teaching scenario may not allow for an ideal LE. Even if you’re not in a
position to select the most appropriate LEs, the LOs must still be consistent
with the given LEs; and if those LEs won’t help learners to achieve the LOs,
then the LOs should be revised – i.e., LOs are still the most important feature
to consider.<strong>The key is to determine exactly what specific LEs can contribute
to learning or how they will help move learners towards the LOs.</strong></p>

<h2 id="select-and-develop-content-relevant-to-the-los">Select and develop content relevant to the LOs</h2>

<h3 id="select-content">Select content</h3>

<p>With LOs and LEs aligned, Phase 3 involves finding the most appropriate
<strong>content</strong> to support learners to achieve the intended LOs. Regardless of where
content is drawn from, what matters is how it supports the LOs.</p>

<blockquote class="comment">
  <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-definitions-of-key-terms-5"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment: Definitions of key terms</div>

  <p><strong>Content</strong>: a specific subject or topic item (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, a
biochemical pathway, R programming) that is the target of learning</p>

</blockquote>

<p>To this end, content selection should be judicious: it shouldn’t try to be all-encompassing
(<span class="citation"><a href="#nilson2016teaching">Nilson 2016</a></span>), but should consider the target Bloom’s levels in
the LOs, and the preparation of learners. Once content that’s considered to be
the core of a course has been identified, additional <strong>auxiliary</strong> materials can
also be selected, and offered, say, as ‘further reading’. Using LOs to drive
content selection in this way thereby both provides focus (avoiding the
temptation to squeeze as much as possible into a course to ensure coverage
(<span class="citation"><a href="#mckeachie2013mckeachie">McKeachie and Svinicki 2013</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#lujan2006too">Lujan and DiCarlo 2006</a></span>)), and increases the
likelihood of accomplishing those LOs.</p>

<p>Sometimes, specific content may be deemed essential (<span class="citation"><a href="#de2017curriculum">De Veaux <i>et al.</i> 2017</a></span>).
Nevertheless, this must still support the LEs and promote achievement of the
LOs; if it doesn’t, then additional content and/or LEs should be considered that
will, or the LOs themselves should be revised, to prevent misalignment of
instructional inputs and learning outcomes. Overall, the role of <strong>LOs here is to
help focus on relevant content, and avoid material that’s either
non-essential/too broad or too narrow</strong>.</p>

<p>If content is, or seems, fixed, it can be difficult to make the shift from
content- to LO-driven decisions. In this case, Messick and Bloom’s can be used to make
adjustments so that what it means to learn that content or what it looks like to have learned that
content can be made concrete and observable. If such fixed content does not lead to observable
behaviors that are, or support the achievement of, LOs, then additional content should be
considered that will; otherwise, it may be necessary to discuss the feasibility of modifying the
content or revising the LOs with those who are able to make changes, to avoid misalignment of
intended and actual curricula</p>

<p>Defining content can be complicated, specially to identify how it can cover the
different LOs. Trainers may need to tools to help them defining content,
<em>e.g.</em> concept maps.</p>

<h3 id="concept-maps">Concept maps</h3>

<p>Concept maps are rough and visual scheme on how the different concepts are linked.
They begin with a main idea (or concept) and then branch out to show how
that main idea can be broken down into specific topics.</p>

<p>For example, the concepts around the nucleus could be represented using the
following concept map:</p>

<figure id="figure-3" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="images/nucleus_concept_map.jpg" alt="Example of concept map to explain the nucleus. It start on the top with &quot;Nucleus&quot;, two arrows leave from this. On the left &quot;Nucleus -- has function --&gt;&quot; links to &quot;has function --&gt; performing chemical activities&quot; and &quot;has function --&gt; cellular reproduction&quot;. On the right, &quot;Nucleus -- consist of --&gt; chromosomes&quot;, which splits into: on the left &quot;chromosomes -- has function --&gt; inheritance&quot;; on the right &quot;chromosomes -- composed of --&gt;&quot; with 2 arrows to the left &quot;-- composed of --&gt; DNA&quot; which then split into &quot;DNA -- composed of --&gt; genes&quot; and &quot;DNA --&gt; has function --&gt; carrying of information&quot;, to the right &quot;-- composed of --&gt; proteins&quot;. " width="505" height="538" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="images/nucleus_concept_map.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 3</strong>:</span> Example of concept map to explain the nucleus. 9 nodes and 6 edges, so 15 concepts in total</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong><em>Why concept maps?</em></strong> Concept maps are graphical tools for organizing and
representing knowledge. They include concepts and the relationships between them.</p>

<p><strong><em>How to use concept maps?</em></strong> Concept maps can be used by trainers to help building
content, by breaking training in small pieces (7+/2 concepts) and by helping
trainers and helpers to connect things together. A good concept map usually
starts with a focused question, a context, and is built with iteration and
feedback.</p>

<p>For example, to answer the questions <em>“What are the FAIR principles?”</em></p>
<ol>
  <li>we start by listing the keywords that should be discussed: Research data,
Research models, Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable</li>
  <li>we link them together in a concept map:</li>
</ol>

<figure id="figure-4" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="images/fair_concept_map.png" alt="It starts on the top with a box &quot;What are FAIR principles?&quot;. An arrow goes from this box to a box below &quot;Set of guiding principles&quot;. From the 2nd box, an arrow goes down with &quot;to make&quot; written and then splits toward 2 boxes: &quot;Research data&quot; on the left, &quot;Research models&quot; on the right. A line connects these 2 boxes with &quot;and&quot; written on it. An arrow starts from research data and splits into 4 arrows pointing to boxes (from left to right): &quot;Findable&quot;, &quot;Accessible&quot;, &quot;Interoperable&quot;, &quot;Re-usable&quot;. " width="1410" height="910" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="images/fair_concept_map.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 4</strong>:</span> Example of concept map to explain the FAIR principles</figcaption></figure>

<p>Concept maps try to objective but they depend on their creators. Everyone has
their own concept map, like the way to go from point A to point B from 2 persons
living in the same city.</p>

<p>In curriculum/lesson/session planning, concept maps present key concepts in a
highly concise manner. They can take into account the existing knowledge of
learners and new concepts This helps in the teaching plan to measure how much
can be covered, and the hierarchical organization suggests a sequence to cover
material.</p>

<h2 id="develop-assessments-to-ensure-progression">Develop assessments to ensure progression</h2>

<p>In any course, learners benefit from having opportunities to show that they’re
progressing. Generally, this is done using various types of assessment,
including tests, feedback surveys, and so on. Nicholls’ model includes two
different types of assessment, to evaluate:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>learning</strong>, to detect changes in learner performance during instruction, to
identify their strengths, and diagnose their weaknesses – i.e., <strong>formative
assessment</strong> (or feedback). This can inform decisions about how to modify
instruction to better promote learning; it can also inform learners about
changes they may need to make to improve their learning;</li>
  <li><strong>instructional outcomes</strong>, to verify whether learners achieved the stated LOs
after instruction – i.e., <strong>summative assessment</strong>. This can help to inform
decisions both about learners (e.g., ranking their performances) and about
the course (<em>i.e.</em>, whether any of its LOs, LEs, etc. need to be redesigned).</li>
</ol>

<blockquote class="comment">
  <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-definitions-of-key-terms-6"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment: Definitions of key terms</div>

  <p><strong>Formative assessment</strong>: formal or informal assessments (or feedback) made
during learning so that instruction or practice can be better targeted for
learners to be able to fully achieve target LOs</p>

  <p><strong>Summative assessment</strong>: assessments made after a period of instruction in
order to monitor whether LOs have been achieved</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Formative and summative assessments (<span class="citation"><a href="#walvoord2010assessment">Walvoord 2010</a></span>) are
important for determining whether and what learning has occurred. Summative
assessment doesn’t generally yield information about learners’ progress: it sums
up what learning has been achieved after instruction relative to the intended
outcomes (via written tests, practical tasks, or other measurable activities),
and gives valuable data about learning attainment at the level of individuals
and entire learner cohorts. This can be tricky for short courses, but may be
necessary for those that give credits or offer certificates of completion.</p>

<p>Formative assessments are applied throughout a course; planned thoughtfully,
they can improve the performance of learners and instructors. Ideally, they
should be used often (say, every 15-20 minutes), thereby also yielding
opportunities to change pace and refocus learners’ attention. It may be hard to
conceive how to integrate such assessments into a course, but they need not be
complex or time-consuming (just informative about learning at a given point).</p>

  <p>The most effective way to test student understanding is to do so in class:
it’s important to seize the moment, and deal with potential misunderstandings
as soon as they arise. These in-class tips may be helpful:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>reflection</strong>: towards the end of a training session, ask learners to reflect
on, and write down, a list of new concepts and skills they’ve learned. Ask
them to consider how they’d apply these concepts or skills in a practical
setting;</li>
    <li><strong>agreed signals</strong>: gauge learners’ satisfaction with a training session by
asking them to use agreed signals (<em>e.g.</em>, raising coloured post-it notes to
indicate that the pace is too fast/ slow, etc.). This engages all learners,
and allows you to check their confi- dence with the content and its
delivery, even in large groups;</li>
    <li><strong>3-2-1</strong>: at the end of a training session, ask learners to note 3 things
they learned, 2 things they want to know more about, and 1 question they
have. This stimulates reflection on the session, and helps to process their
learning;</li>
    <li><strong>misconception check</strong>: present some common or predictable misconceptions
about a concept you’ve covered. Ask learners whether they agree or disagree,
and to explain why;</li>
    <li><strong>diagnostic questions/questionnaires (which may be anonymous)</strong>: ask learners
to note one thing they didn’t understand or that they missed, and one thing
that was very clear to them, or make them complete a multiple choice quiz,
then display and discuss the answers with them.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These, and many other simple assessments, may be found in
<a href="http://www.opencolleges.edu.au/informed/features/21-ways-to-check-for-student-understanding/">Briggs’ online list of 21 ways to check for student understanding</a>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If formative assessments are used frequently, and lead to specific decisions by
learners and instructors, then instruction (or learner preparation) can be
modified to better develop the target LOs (<span class="citation"><a href="#dylan2008integrating">Dylan and Thompson 2008</a></span>,
<span class="citation"><a href="#trumbull2013understanding">Trumbull and Lash 2013</a></span>). Such assessments can be designed to
anticipate, and identify which learners are experiencing, common
misunderstandings, and gauge their readiness to move ahead; they can also help
learners to identify their own strengths and weaknesses by encouraging
reflection on what they do/don’t know or are/aren’t confident about, honing
their abilities to self-assess (<span class="citation"><a href="#ambrose2010learning">Ambrose <i>et al.</i> 2010</a></span>). Furthermore,
ideas for how to address any issues they’ve found, or for further learning, can
be built in (e.g., <em>“if you chose option C, you might want to re-read the
handout”</em>); formative assessments can therefore also support self-instruction.</p>

<p>Using actionable formative and summative assessment can help to ensure that LOs,
and progress towards them, are explicitly supported. <strong>LOs clarify what
specifically needs to be assessed and why.</strong></p>

<h2 id="evaluate-course-effectiveness">Evaluate course effectiveness</h2>

<p>The final step is to perform an actionable evaluation by collecting qualitative
and quantitative course data to assess its effectiveness in leading learners to
the stated LOs. Summative assessments can be useful here: <em>e.g.</em>, if they reveal
uniformly low levels of achievement, it may indicate that future revisions are
needed to ensure that LEs, assessments and LOs are aligned; it could also flag
problems with the assessment – it’s vital to understand whether performance
reflects student learning levels or issues with the assessment itself (poorly
worded test questions, ambiguous response options, etc.), and, if not, to take
steps to ensure that it does.</p>

<p>Even if a full quantitative course evaluation isn’t possible, it may still be
possible to solicit actionable evidence of its impact via short- or long-term
feedback surveys. It’s tempting to use completion rates or learner satisfaction
as proxies for success; however, although simple to collate, these outcomes
aren’t informative about learners’ growth or course effectiveness. Satisfaction
surveys often use pre- and post-course questionnaires
(<span class="citation"><a href="#jordan_kari_2018_1325464">Jordan <i>et al.</i> 2018</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#gurwitz2020framework">Gurwitz <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>) to collect
demographic details, and solicit learners’ self-evaluations and reactions to a
course. Reviewing learners’ perceptions can help to identify whether the
conditions for learning were present, but alone will not shed light on whether
the intended LOs were achieved: learner perceptions may be affected by factors
unrelated to course effectiveness, and their self-assessments may be biased
(e.g., less-skilled learners notoriously overestimate their abilities – the
Dunning-Kruger effect (<span class="citation"><a href="#kruger1999unskilled">Kruger and Dunning 1999</a></span>)).</p>

<p>There are many evaluation methods, each with advantages and disadvantages; all
concur that multiple features need to be considered. One framework collates
learner reactions, their actual learning, changes in their behaviour, and the
impact of the course on their organisation.</p>

<blockquote class="details">
  <div class="box-title details-title" id="details-methods-to-evaluate-training-effectiveness"><button class="gtn-boxify-button details" type="button" aria-controls="details-methods-to-evaluate-training-effectiveness" aria-expanded="true"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Details: Methods to evaluate training effectiveness</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p>Evaluation methods provide systematic frameworks for analysing the
effectiveness of training courses. The first approach was introduced by
Raymond Katzell in 1956 and later popularised by Kirkpatrick
(<span class="citation"><a href="#kirkpatrick1979techniques">Kirkpatrick 1979</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#kirkpatrick2006evaluating">Kirkpatrick and Kirkpatrick 2006</a></span>).
The Kirkpatrick-Katzell method proposes a four-level strategy:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Reaction</strong> – what do learners feel about the training?</li>
    <li><strong>Learning</strong> – what did learners retain from the training?</li>
    <li><strong>Behaviour</strong> – did learners put their learning into practice
  on-the-job (did their working behaviour change)?</li>
    <li><strong>Results</strong> – did their behavioural changes have an overall impact on
  their organisation (e.g., greater productivity)?</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Surveying each level helps collect qualitative and quantitative data to
evaluate training effectiveness. Note: this isn’t a real taxonomy, as there’s
no evidence that outcomes at successive levels are linked (<em>e.g.</em>, no
correlation has been found between the reaction and learning stages
<span class="citation"><a href="#gessler2009correlation">Gessler 2009</a></span>). However, if level 2 results indicate that
learning didn’t occur, those from level 1 may identify aspects of a course
that disappointed learners and help understand what should be improved. Many
other approaches to training evaluation have been developed,
<a href="https://kodosurvey.com/blog/training-evaluations-models-complete-guide">each focusing on slightly different levels or stages</a>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Such features can be explicitly targeted in short- or long-term surveys: <em>e.g.</em>,
end-of-course, summative quizzes can be used to test achievement of intended
LOs; longer-term questions (say, 6-12 months after a course) can focus on the
extent to which learners have put their acquired KSAs into working practice; and
so on. Overall, it’s important to choose an appropriate evaluation method for your
circumstances, and, alongside learner reactions to the course, for your
evaluation to consider what results you expected to achieve, whether the LOs
were achieved, and whether learners’ on-the-job practices changed.</p>

<p>Actionable evaluation is essential for identifying aspects of a course that may
benefit from intervention, leading to concrete decisions about what needs to be
remediated and why (<span class="citation"><a href="#worthen1997program">Worthen <i>et al.</i> 1997</a></span>). Designing meaningful
evaluations requires thought; in some cases, it may help to appoint independent
evaluators or advisory boards, as external reviewers can give objective
appraisals, and may also help to frame the course against national/international
standards. <strong>Ultimately, the evaluation should identify what works in a course,
and what needs remediation, to better support the achievement of the intended
LOs</strong>.</p>

## Logistics that will help or hinder learning

Reproducibility of compute environments

- Identical installation setup on every computer and sufficient hardware (power
  and memory) to run the tools
- Different courses, different compute requirements: Unix, R, Python,
  metagenomics, long read sequencing
- Installation process time-consuming and technically challenging
- Virtual machines, cloud computing, containers, software images
  - Allocate time (pre-sessions) to make sure installations are up and running

Training rooms for bioinformatics

Physical environment

- Room geometry: seats’ quality, the lighting, the room temperature control, the
  stability of power and network connections
- Functionality : video, audio, drawing surfaces (whiteboard, flipchart paper),
  a corkboard to pin materials
- Hardware needs: power suppliers, network connections with a good quality wifi

<p>When developing a course, it’s helpful to document the design process, including
details of how it was conceptualised, the assumptions and decisions made along
the way, the assessment criteria, etc., and to share that documentation with
instructors and learners (this can be done via community mailing lists, through
blog posts, collaborative repositories, social channels, using GitHub, Slack,
etc.). By way of example, <a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a> provide
<a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/guide/">instructor note</a> for most of
their courses. These are collectively-written documents that reflect on the
strengths and weaknesses of the course design (and its materials), what
did/didn’t work, suggested improvements, tips for teaching, challenges
encountered, learner feedback, and indications of where alignment of
LOs/LEs/content/assessments failed, and why.</p>

<p>Best practices like this help course designers and communities of trainers to
understand what was intended, what was done, and why those might be different,
if they are. This is particularly valuable for courses whose materials are not
developed by its instructors. Such documentation can thus facilitate reflection
and promote good practice, and can help new instructors prepare to deliver the
course. If made available to learners, it can help them to understand what they
can expect from a course, and make informed decisions about whether it will help
them to achieve their learning goals; it may also help them to better gauge their
performance, and to identify what will help them perform better – it may therefore
also improve learning outcomes.</p>

<p>As data and models should be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable &amp; Re-usable),
training materials (slides, exercises, datasets, etc) should also be FAIR</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Findable</strong> - can be searched and found by the trainers community</li>
  <li><strong>Accessible</strong> - can be read/downloaded by other trainers</li>
  <li><strong>Interoperable</strong> - can be understood clearly in the context of the original
course</li>
  <li><strong>Re-usable</strong> - can be used by other trainers</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Course design is prefaced by determining the purpose of the programme, analysing
the context in which the course will be delivered and who will benefit.
Fundamental to this process is to identify the needs the course will address,
its target audience, and the prerequisite KSAs that learners must have in order
to profit most from the course. Identifying the target audience and learner
prerequisites helps to define criteria for selecting participants, should a
limit be needed to maximise course effectiveness.</p>

<p>Once such ‘situational analysis’ has been completed, the starting point, and
pivotal reference for all subsequent stages of the course-design process, is to
articulate SMART LOs. As part of this process, Bloom’s taxonomy is useful for
defining LOs that are measurable, and whose cognitive complexity increases along
a developmental trajectory; and Messick’s questions help both to select KSAs and
LOs, and to ensure alignment of instruction and assessment. Crucially, informed
choices need to be made about the LEs (and the content they use) that best align
with the goal of achieving specific LOs <strong>in the time available</strong>. General topic
areas (life sciences, computer science, data science, etc.) may provide the
overarching framework, but your goals for learners should drive how content is
selected, taught and assessed. In terms of assessment approaches, formative
assessment is generally more relevant for short courses, but summative
assessment may be necessary for accredited courses. Ultimately, it’s important
to understand what each type of assessment contributes to the course-design
process and to build your practice to maximise the effectiveness of each.</p>

<p>Evaluating course effectiveness should be the final stage of a robust design
process, and the first step towards course re-design and improvement, should the
course be delivered regularly. To do this rigorously, it’s helpful to employ a
multi-level evaluation strategy, in which learner satisfaction is just one
strand (used alone, learner satisfaction is not a reliable metric of success).</p>

<p>Course design requires thought and time. Successful courses support learners as
they develop from entry-level performance to the minimum performance level for
achieving the target LOs. If designed specifically to support learners and LOs,
and evaluated against that objective, the instruction that’s delivered and
learning that’s intended are more likely to match. This can’t guarantee success
for all learners, but does create the optimal circumstances for success.</p>

<p>Structured approaches benefit course design by leveraging what’s already known
about learning, and providing a framework for decision-making. The process can
be challenging, but investing in it is likely to pay dividends. Ultimately,
everything in the design should lead to, and support development of, the LOs
that learners should possess, and be able to demonstrate, on completion of a
course. For ease of reference, the approach outlined here can be distilled into
the simple set of recommendations summarised:</p>

Considerations for training and self-directed learning
Designing instruction is challenging, requiring thought, attention and time; this is just as true for
short-form and self-instruction as it is for curricula and programs of study (Diamond, 2008). Self-
directed learners need to make informed decisions about which training sessions will be most likely
to help them achieve their own learning goals; they therefore need to develop a sense of whether
  14
particular learning opportunities or LEs can actually support the stated LOs (e.g., in order to be
able to choose between several different offerings of a ‘data science’ course that appear
superficially similar). Similarly, trainers need to focus on, and make informed choices about, the
LEs that best align with the objective of achieving specific LOs in the time available.
Assessment presents greater challenges for training and self-directed learning. Trainers can use
short- and longer-term evaluations to determine, say, interest in, or consistency in implementing,
the training material; but formative assessment is generally the most relevant assessment tool for
this context. Self-directed learners may be unlikely to create formative assessments, but they may
formulate LOs for themselves and then try to determine whether they have met them, or whether
they need to augment their learning with supplemental reading or exercises/activities. Job
descriptions and published descriptors (the European Qualifications Framework (European
Communities, 2008), etc.) can be leveraged by self-directed learners and trainers; these concretely
describe specific KSAs that can be used as targets, against which to compare the LOs or LEs they
are considering.
