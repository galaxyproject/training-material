<p>
<p>The GTN has support for JupyterLite and the Pyodide kernel which runs <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/">Python in the browser via webassembly/javascript</a>. This comes with some restrictions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Python only</li>
  <li>No filesystem access (so no <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wget</code> prep steps)</li>
  <li>Little to no cell magic</li>
</ul>

<p>However, it means we can run a lot of our Python training
directly in the GTN! And in the future, hopefully, we will
be able to embed individual cells of the notebook directly
in the Python training, so the user doesn’t even need to
switch pages.</p>

<p>Enabling this field will enable pyolite links for this notebook.</p>

<p>If you have an alternative preamble for your notebook that students should know before following (e.g. they must load X datasets in their history), it can be listed here.</p>

<p>This text will be shown in the GTN tutorial, but it will <strong>not</strong> be included in the notebook, giving you a bit better control over mixing setup content which is relevant for Galaxy, with notebook content that can be easy to run for students.</p>
