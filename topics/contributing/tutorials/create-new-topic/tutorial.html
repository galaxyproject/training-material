The idea was to develop something open and online based on a community effort, as always in Galaxy.",

All training materials (slides, tutorials, …) related to a topic are found in a dedicated directory (<em>e.g.</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transcriptomics</code> directory contains the material related to exome sequencing analysis).</p>

<h2 id="directory-structure">Directory structure</h2>

<p>Each topic has the following structure:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>├── README.md

│   │   │   ├── workflow.ga
│   │   ├── tours
│   │   │   ├── tour.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="images-directory"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">images</code> directory</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">images</code> directory collects all images/pictures needed for the training materials related to the topic, <em>i.e</em> pictures for the slides or the tutorials.</p>

<p>Images shared between several topics are in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shared/images</code> directory at the root.</p>

<p>All images for the slides must be in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">images</code> directory. The images must be in good quality. The sources (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">svg</code> or other) of the images must also be added to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">images</code> directory. We encourage you to use <a href="https://www.yworks.com/products/yed">yEd</a> to easily generate diagrams and <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a> for any other images.</p>

<h3 id="tutorials-directory"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tutorials</code> directory</h3>

<p>This directory collects the materials related to the topic, one material per subdirectory, though it may consist of slides, tutorials, or both.</p>

<p>The tutorials are hands-on built for workshop and self-training, with description of the whole infrastructure needed to run the tutorial on any Galaxy instance (tools, data library, etc).</p>

<p>The templates for the tutorials are different from the other pages to help users to focus on the content of the tutorial. To improve the output of the tutorial, several metadata are mandatory for every tutorials, such as the requirements or the objectives of the tutorials. Boxes are also used to highlight some key points as the hands-on or the tips.</p>

<p>The content of each tutorial is generated with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> from a Markdown file and some metadata (e.g. the requirements, the Zenodo link, the questions) defined inside the metadata of the related topic.</p>

<p>Sometimes, an hands-on tutorial is not the most appropriate format for a tutorial and slides are better.</p>

<h3 id="docker-directory"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker</code> directory</h3>

<p>For each topic, a flavored Docker image must integrate the tools needed for
the tutorials. The corresponding image must be based on official Galaxy Docker
images.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of topics we will cover: topics with their own materials, and synthetic topics that are based solely on a tag. For large collections of materials around a single central theme a topic with materials is a good choice. However, sometimes you will want to highlight materials spread across numerous or disparate topics like e.g. Cancer or SARS-CoV-2 tutorials where you might have individual tutorials on assembly or transcriptomics, but you’d like a single page listing all of them.</p>

<h1 id="creating-a-new-topic-with-its-own-materials">Creating a new topic with it’s own materials</h1>

<h2 id="defining-the-topic">Defining the topic</h2>

<p>When we structured the repository, we decided to use as topics the categories that are used in the <a href="https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/">ToolShed</a>. The ToolShed assigns a category to each tool. Therefore, to decide where to put your tutorial, have a look at which ToolShed’s category the main tools in your tutorial belong. For example, this tutorial will rely on the NCBI Blast+ tool.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Search for NCBI Blast+ on the <a href="https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/">ToolShed</a></li>

We decided to put it in “Sequence analysis” because this is the most general one for this tutorial.</p>

<h3 id="subtopics">Subtopics</h3>

<p>For large topics, we can define subtopics and create multiple tutorial lists, within a topic’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">metadata.yaml</code></p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">transcriptomics</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each subtopic has:</p>
<ul>
  <li>an ID, used as a reference in the tutorial</li>
  <li>a short descriptive title</li>
  <li>a longer description discussion what is contained in that subtopic</li>
</ul>

<p>Tutorials can be assigned to subtopics by adding e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subtopic: singlecell</code> to the tutorial metadata. An example of this subtopic division can be found in the <a href="/training-material/topics/admin/">admin section</a></p>

<h1 id="creating-a-tag-based-topic">Creating a tag based topic</h1>

<p>For tag based topics, first ensure that all of the relevant tutorials share a single tag, across all materials that should be included in this view.</p>

<h2 id="defining-the-topic-1">Defining the topic</h2>

<p>Compare with other topic level metadata files in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">metadata/</code> directory of the training material. Then create a file of your own naming the topic and providing editorial board members and so on. We will use the Covid-19 synthetic topic as an example:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">covid19"</span>
<span class="na">type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">use"</span>
<span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">SARS-CoV-2"</span>
<span class="na">summary</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">Tutorials</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">covering</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">analysis</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">of</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">SARS-CoV-2</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">(COVID</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">19)"</span>
<span class="na">tag_based</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span>

<span class="na">editorial_board</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">wm75</span>

<span class="na">gitter</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">galaxyproject/sars-cov-2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see it is very short, and there are only a handful of important points:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tag_based</code> must be set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> must be equal to the tag name, that’s being used across tutorials.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subtopics</code> must not be set.</li>
</ul>

<p>With this done, all materials tagged <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">covid19</code> will be aggregated and available under this synthetic topic. They are organised by the “parent” topic, so e.g. assembly tutorials are collected together and transcriptomics tutorials are also in a section together, similar to how other tutorials define subtopics.</p>

<h2 id="more-manual-tag-based-topics">More manual tag based topics</h2>

<p>If you wish to more manually curate the tutorials listed in your tag-based topic, you can provide subtopics. These must have IDs that match tags that are expected to be found within your tag-based topic.</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">gmod</span>
<span class="na">type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">use</span>
<span class="na">topic_type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">technology</span>
<span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">GMOD</span>
<span class="na">edam_ontology</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">[</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">topic_0362"</span><span class="pi">]</span>

<span class="na">tag_based</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span>

<span class="na">subtopics</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">id</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">jbrowse1</span>
    <span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">JBrowse</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">1"</span>
    <span class="na">description</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Learn to use JBrowse v1 here.</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">id</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">apollo2</span>
    <span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Apollo v2</span>
    <span class="na">description</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Apollo is a collaborative, real time genome annotation editor.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here anything with a tag <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jbrowse1</code> will appear under the JBrowse section, same for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apollo2</code> and the Apollo section. Tutorials may appear multiple times, but this is still useful as it gives you a way to provide additional organisation within your topic.</p>
