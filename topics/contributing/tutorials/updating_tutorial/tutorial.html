The idea was to develop something open and online based on a community effort, as always in Galaxy.",

                <p>Here, we provide a clear set of instructions for updating a GTN tutorial that uses the Galaxy interface for performing analysis. The GTN, and Galaxy, have a number of features to make it as reproducible and shareable as possible, so navigating what needs to be done for an overall update may feel daunting - but not anymore!</p>

<p>We encourage you to pick a tutorial to try this on, so you can use this tutorial side-by-side.</p>

  <li>Check with <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/">individual communities</a>, who may have their own method of tracking.

<h1 id="phase-4-test--fix-the-workflow">Phase 4: Test &amp; fix the workflow</h1>

<p>It’s crucial to test the workflow, as often times the outputs will be different due to the new tool versions. It can also transpire that the newer tool versions lead to errors, either because they don’t work or because you need to change parameter settings that were previously unavailable or not required. Testing is key!</p>
