# Slides

- Introduce a subject
- Quick overview
- Not too much text
- Images are Nice

???

- Slides a great way to introduce an audience to your subject.
- They're best to use for a quick overview, not a detailed look at the subject.
- Lots of images can be a good choice to communicate information, and avoid slides full of text when possible as learners can get bored or distracted.

---

## Content

- Background information for the tutorial. E.g.:
  - Motivation why X is useful
  - Concepts needed to get most out of tutorial
- Examples relevant to audience
  - Avoid: "here is a feature to add link type tracks"
  - Try for: "If you want to visualise SVs in cancer, ... this link type tracks are useful"
  - Try for: Using examples from existing papers

???

- If your slides are attached to a tutorial, then they can be a good place to provide learners with motivation for the tutorial.
- If you can provide examples that are relevant to your audience, this will encourage them to follow the tutorial.
- Try to avoid dry text and links to external resources whenever possible, those can be best in the tutorial which a learner would read at their own pace, rather than slides which are presented at the presenter's pace.

## Formatting: Basic

.pull-left[
<span style="font-size: 35px;font-family: 'Yanone Kaffeesatz';font-weight: normal;text-align: center;">Slide Title</span>

A list

- Item 1
- Item 2

and numbered list

1. Item
2. Item

Some text with a [link](https://example.org/) and an image:

![Description of the image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)
]

.pull-right[
```markdown
### Slide Title

A list

- Item 1
- Item 2

and numbered list

1. Item
2. Item

Some text with a [link](https://example.org/) and an image:

![Description of the image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)
---
```
]

Slides begin with a title `### ...` and should end with a `---`

???

- Slides are written with standard markdown, and begin with a header, and end with three dashes.
- Lists, links, and images are all written with their normal syntax.
- If you're familiar with markdown and already writing your tutorial in it, this should be an easy addition.
- The only differences are the dashes to separate slides, and speaker notes which we'll cover later.

---



### Formatting: Alignment

.left[Left-aligned text]
.center[Centered text]
.right[Right-aligned text]
.left[![Left-aligned image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)]
.center[![Centered image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)]
.right[![Right-aligned image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)]

```markdown
.left[Left-aligned text]
.center[Centered text]
.right[Right-aligned text]
.left[![Left-aligned image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)]
.center[![Centered image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)]
.right[![Right-aligned image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)]
```

???

- Everything can be aligned using several CSS classes which are provided, left, right, and center.
- The classes are added with a dot followed by the class, and then the contents within square brackets.

---



### Formatting: Incremental Text

1. Item

???

- Incremental text can be added

--

2. Appears

???

- And appears incrementally on every slide.

--


Just separate every item with two dashes (`--`)

```markdown
1. Item

--

2. Appears
```

???

- You can accomplish this with two dashes instead of three for incremental slides.
- The dashes should be on their own line, just like the slide separating dashes.

---



### Formatting: Images

.pull-left[
Demo:

10%

.image-10[ ![GTN Logo (tiny)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png) ]

50%

.image-50[ ![GTN Logo (slightly larger)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png) ]

]
.pull-right[
Source:

```markdown
10%
.image-10[
  ![GTN Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)
]

50%
.image-50[
  ![GTN Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)
]
```
]


There are [other CSS classes available](https://github.com/galaxyproject{{ site.baseurl }}/blob/main/assets/css/slides.css#L67) for other sizes

???

- There are a number of CSS classes available to use for styling the content you show on your slides.
- Here you can see images scaled to 10% and 50%.
- There are a number of other classes that you can find in the GTN's codebase.

### Formatting: Tables

.pull-left[
Demo:

column1    | column2      | column3
---        | ---          | ---
aaaaaaaaaa | bbbb         | cccc
dddd       | eeeeeeeeeeee | ffff
gggg       | hhhh         | iiiiiiiiii
]

.pull-right[
Source:

```markdown
column1    | column2      | column3
---        | ---          | ---
aaaaaaaaaa | bbbb         | cccc
dddd       | eeeeeeeeeeee | ffff
gggg       | hhhh         | iiiiiiiiii
```
]

By default, tables are left-aligned with text left-aligned.

???

- Tables can be written in the simplified markdown syntax, or using a more complex one that allows for alignment.
- Here a simple table is shown with several columns.
- The tables do not need to be aligned, we just did that in this slide for clarity.

---



### Formatting: Tables with Aligned Text

Different alignments for the individual columns can be controlled with the `:` character

.pull-left[
Demo:

| Tables       | Are      | Cool          |
|:-------------|:--------:|--------------:|
| left-aligned | centered | right-aligned |
| row2         | row2     | row2          |

]

.pull-right[
Source:
```markdown
| Tables       | Are      | Cool          |
|:-------------|:--------:|--------------:|
| left-aligned | centered | right-aligned |
| row2         | row2     | row2          |
```
]

???

- If you need more complex tables, you can use the colon character to control the alignment.
- If you are presenting numeric data or similar then this can be useful to make the data more readable.

---



### Formatting: Footnotes

Content with footnotes

Source:
```markdown
.footnote[Normal footnote with plenty of text]
```

Demo:

.footnote[Normal footnote with plenty of text]

???

- Footnotes can be used for explanatory notes or adding things like references.
- References are ideal footnote content as they are not necessarily important for comprehension of the slides, but might be useful later for learners.

---



### Formatting: Two Columns

This is achived with the `.pull-left` and `.pull-right` classes.

```markdown
.pull-left[
Some text, as many texts as we want...

or even table

column1 | column2 | column3
--- | --- | ---
row1 | r1c2 | r1c3
row2 | r2c2 | r2c3
row3 | r3c2 | r3c3
]

.pull-right[ ![GTN Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png) ]
```

Will be rendered as:

???

- Two column layouts can easily be achieved with the pull left and pull right classes.
- The result of this is demonstrated on the next slide.

### Formatting: Two Columns

.pull-left[
Some text, as many text as we want.....

or even table

column1 | column2 | column3
--- | --- | ---
row1 | r1c2 | r1c3
row2 | r2c2 | r2c3
row3 | r3c2 | r3c3
]

.pull-right[
![GTN Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)
]

???

- Any content can be placed in the left and right columns
- The addition of these classes will wrap all of their contents and place them on the left or right sides.
- The two column layout is an especially good choice if you want to show a graphic and discuss some important points related to it.

---



## Presenter Notes

Allows you to:

- See the next slide before the audience
- See notes you have made on your slides

![Image showing presenter mode](../../images/presenter-mode.png)

???

- Presenter Mode lets you have two windows with the same slides, one with presenter notes and a preview of the upcoming slide.
- When giving presentations with multiple screens or on a projector, this makes life less stressful.
- You can use the presenter notes to remind you, and others, of important content to mention on each slide.

### Presenter Notes: Formatting

.left[
<br/>
&#35;&#35;&#35; My Slide
<br/><br/>
Some text!
<br/><br/>
&#63;&#63;&#63;
<br/><br/>
Things written below the ??? are only shown in the
presenter view. Press `p` to bring this up
<br/><br/>
&#45;&#45;&#45;
<br/><br/>
]

???

- Things written below the three question marks are only shown in the presenter view.
- Press P to bring this up, and the question mark to show the presenter view shortcut keys.


---



## Shortcut Keys

- <kbd>?</kbd> activates help
- <kbd>Escape</kbd> leaves help
- <kbd>p</kbd> activates presenter mode
- <kbd>f</kbd> activates full screen mode
- <kbd>c</kbd> clones the slides into a popup

???

- The key to close the help isn't shown in the keyboard shortcuts, but it is the escape key.
- There are a number of other shortcuts which can be useful to know about.
- The clone window function creates a popup with a copy of the slides, this can be used to show the presenter notes on one screen, and the actual slides on another screen that learners can see.

---

## Videos

.pull-left[
- Slides with good speaker notes can be turned into videos
- Enable this in the metadata of the slides:

  ```markdown
  title: "Creating Slides"
  video: true
  questions:
    - "How to format slides?"
  ```

- automatically rendered into narrated videos by the GTN
]

.pull-right[
.image-100[![Screenshot of GTN video player showing a set of slides with a play icon and a transcript](../../images/slides-to-video.png)]
]

???

- The GTN automatically creates videos from selected slide decks.
- Simply by setting video to true to the metadata, slides with sufficiently good speaker notes can be automatically turned into videos.
- The slides have audio narration spoken from the script of the speaker notes by AWS Polly.
- The audio clips, and slides are combined into a video which is then available in the GTN Video Library
