# Slides

- Introduce a subject
- Quick overview
- Not too much text
- Images are Nice

---



## Content

- Background information for the tutorial. E.g.:
  - Motivation behind why X is useful
  - Conepts needed to get most out of tutorial
- Examples relevant to audience
  - Avoid: "here is a feature to add link type tracks"
  - Try for: "If you want to visualise SVs in cancer, ... this link type tracks are useful"
  - Try for: Using examples from existing papers

---


## Formatting: Basic

.pull-left[
<span style="font-size: 35px;font-family: 'Yanone Kaffeesatz';font-weight: normal;text-align: center;">Slide Title</span>

A list

- Item 1
- Item 2

and numbered list

1. Item
2. Item

Some text with a [link](https://example.com/) and an image:

![Description of the image](/training-material/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)
]

.pull-right[
```markdown
### Slide Title

A list

- Item 1
- Item 2

and numbered list

1. Item
2. Item

Some text with a [link](https://example.com/) and an image:

![Description of the image](/training-material/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)
---
```
]

Slides begin with a title `### ...` and should end with a `---`

???
It's standard markdown. There is less need to follow semantic heading guidelines (not skipping levels).

Slides should begin with a header and end with `---`

---



### Formatting: Alignment

.left[Left-aligned text]
.center[Centered text]
.right[Right-aligned text]
.left[![Left-aligned image](/training-material/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)]
.center[![Centered image](/training-material/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)]
.right[![Right-aligned image](/training-material/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)]

```markdown
.left[Left-aligned text]
.center[Centered text]
.right[Right-aligned text]
.left[![Left-aligned image](/training-material/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)]
.center[![Centered image](/training-material/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)]
.right[![Right-aligned image](/training-material/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)]
```

???
Alignment is not too complex, just css classes being applied to contents.

---



### Formatting: Incremental Text

1. Item

--

2. Appears

--


Just separate every item with two dashes (`--`)

```markdown
1. Item

--

2. Appears
```

---



### Formatting: Images

.pull-left[
Demo:

10%

.image-10[ ![](/training-material/assets/images/GTN-60px.png) ]

50%

.image-50[ ![](/training-material/assets/images/GTN-60px.png) ]

]
.pull-right[
Source:

```markdown
10%
.image-10[
  ![](/training-material/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)
]

50%
.image-50[
  ![](/training-material/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)
]
```
]


There are [other CSS classes available](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/blob/master/assets/css/slides.css#L67) for other sizes
---



### Formatting: Tables

.pull-left[
Demo:

column1    | column2      | column3
---        | ---          | ---
aaaaaaaaaa | bbbb         | cccc
dddd       | eeeeeeeeeeee | ffff
gggg       | hhhh         | iiiiiiiiii
]

.pull-right[
Source:

```markdown
column1    | column2      | column3
---        | ---          | ---
aaaaaaaaaa | bbbb         | cccc
dddd       | eeeeeeeeeeee | ffff
gggg       | hhhh         | iiiiiiiiii
```
]

By default, tables are left-aligned with text left-aligned.

???
The tables do not need to be aligned, we just did that in this slide for legibility / clarity.

---



### Formatting: Tables with Aligned Text

Different alignments for the individual columns can be controlled with the `:` character

.pull-left[
Demo:

| Tables       | Are      | Cool          |
|:-------------|:--------:|--------------:|
| left-aligned | centered | right-aligned |
| row2         | row2     | row2          |

]

.pull-right[
Source:
```markdown
| Tables       | Are      | Cool          |
|:-------------|:--------:|--------------:|
| left-aligned | centered | right-aligned |
| row2         | row2     | row2          |
```
]

---



### Formatting: Footnotes

Content with footnotes

Source:
```markdown
.footnote[Normal footnote with plenty of text]
```

Demo:

.footnote[Normal footnote with plenty of text]

---



### Formatting: Two Columns

This is achived with the `.pull-left` and `.pull-right` classes.

```markdown
.pull-left[
Some text, as many text as we want.....

or even table

column1 | column2 | column3
--- | --- | ---
row1 | r1c2 | r1c3
row2 | r2c2 | r2c3
row3 | r3c2 | r3c3
]

.pull-right[ ![](/training-material/assets/images/GTN-60px.png) ]
```

Will be rendered as:
