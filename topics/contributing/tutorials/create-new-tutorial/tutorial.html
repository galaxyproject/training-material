                <p>Galaxy is a great solution to train bioinformatics concepts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>numerous bioinformatics tools are available (over 8,000 in the ToolShed)</li>
  <li>it can be used by people without any computer science skills</li>
  <li>it trains to use technology, outlining available resources and efforts that have made them accessible to researchers</li>
  <li>it is scalable</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2016, the Galaxy Training Network decide to set up a new infrastructure for easily delivering Galaxy related training material. The idea was to develop something open, online, based on a community effort, and on top of the Galaxy platform.</p>

<p>We took inspiration from <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> and collected everything on a GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material">https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material</a>.
We decided on a structure focusing on tutorials with hands-on activities; fitting both for online self-training but also for workshops. Each tutorial follows the same structure and comes with a virtualised instance allowing you to run the training anywhere you have resources available.</p>

<p>Here you will learn how to create a new tutorial by developing a small tutorial explaining how to retrieve climate data from Copernicus (using <strong>Copernicus Climate Data Store</strong> tool).</p>

  <p>This tutorial explains the different steps to create a tutorial for the Galaxy Training Material.
It may require some knowledge that you may not have or do not have the time to learn. If this is the case, you can create a skeleton of a tutorial with whatever existing materials you have, using your prefered text editor, and then share it with us by opening <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/issues/new">issue on GitHub</a>, writing us on <a href="https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby">Gitter</a>, or sending us an <a href="mailto:galaxytrainingnetwork@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>

<h1 id="define-the-topic">Define the topic</h1>

<p>The first step we need to do is to identify in which topic to place our new tutorial. This can be tricky. When we structured the GTN, we decided that each training material should be related to a topic.</p>

<p>We decided to use the categories from the <a href="https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/">ToolShed</a> as our initial list of topics. Since every tool uploaded to the ToolShed must be in at least one category, you can look at the main tools in your tutorial and see which categories they are placed in within the ToolShed. This can provide a guide for where you might put your new tutorial. For example, if your tutorial will rely on the <strong>Copernicus</strong> tool:</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <div class="box-title hands-on-title" id="hands-on-defining-the-topic-for-the-tutorial"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Hands-on: Defining the topic for the tutorial</div>

  <ol>
    <li>Search for <strong>Copernicus</strong> on the <a href="https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/">ToolShed</a></li>
    <li>Check in which category it has been placed</li>
  </ol>

  <blockquote class="solution">
    <div class="box-title solution-title" id="solution"><button class="gtn-boxify-button solution" type="button" aria-controls="solution" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Solution</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>
    <p>There are a couple steps to reaching the answer:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Search for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copernicus</code></li>
      <li>Press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to search</li>
      <li>Click on the result named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c3s</code></li>
      <li>At the bottom of this page there is a box labelled “Categories”</li>
    </ol>

    <p>It is placed in one category: “Climate Analysis”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <ol>
    <li>Look if the categories fit to existing topics in the Galaxy Training Material</li>
  </ol>

  <p>If the categories in ToolShed do not fit to any existing topics, we recommend to use your better judgment to identify in which topic your tutorial should go. You can also ask us on <a href="https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby">Gitter</a> or raise an issue on <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material">GitHub</a> explaining the aim of the tutorial. We will be happy to help you there.</p>

</blockquote>

<h1 id="store-a-tutorial">Store a tutorial</h1>

<p>All training materials (slides, tutorials, …) related to a topic are found in a dedicated directory (<em>e.g.</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">climate</code> directory contains the material related to Climate analyses). Each topic has the following structure:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>├── README.md
├── metadata.yaml
├── images
├── docker
│   ├── Dockerfile
├── slides
│   ├── index.html
├── tutorials
│   ├── tutorial1
│   │   ├── tutorial.md
│   │   ├── slides.html
│   │   ├── data-library.yaml
│   │   ├── workflows
│   │   │   ├── workflow.ga
│   │   ├── tours
│   │   │   ├── tour.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once the topic has been chosen, we can create the tutorial. An ideal tutorial in the Galaxy Training Network contains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a tutorial file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tutorial.md</code> written in Markdown with hands-on</li>
  <li>an optional slides file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slides.html</code> in Markdown with slides to support the tutorial</li>
  <li>a directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">workflows</code> with workflows extracted from the tutorial</li>
  <li>a YAML file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data-library.yaml</code>  with the links to the input data needed for the tutorial</li>
</ul>

<p>The most important file is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tutorial.md</code> where the content of the tutorial is. The other files are not mandatory. They are there to support the tutorial and make it robust and usable across many environments. But they can help a lot in the development of new tutorial.</p>

<h1 id="create-the-workflow">Create the workflow</h1>

<p>Our tutorials try to follow the “learn by doing” approach; they combine both theoretical and practical sections done on Galaxy.</p>

<p>Most tutorials explain step-by-step a data analysis by running the tools. The steps taken in the tutorial can be represented as a workflow.</p>

<p>Before writing the tutorial, it is a good practice to get a workflow with the different steps that will be run during the tutorial. The workflow does not have to be the final one but at least the major steps. It helps to get a direction for the tutorial but also to generate a skeleton of the tutorial as we will see later.</p>

<h1 id="get-a-toy-dataset">Get a toy dataset</h1>

<p>To run the different steps, the tutorial needs some data. The selected data must be informative enough to illustrate the meaning of using a tool or a given technique, but not too big to require long waiting times for processing during a workshop. Upload and download of files into and out of Galaxy is usually quick, but the time taken for a tool to run can be long. Tool run times of no more than 10-15 mins are recommended. Typically, the selected data should be the informative subset of a full real-life dataset.</p>

<p>Below we describe two examples of how toy datasets were generated for tutorials:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Example 1</strong>: creating a toy dataset from scratch
    <ul>
      <li>Take one 16S sequence (for example found in the test case of a Galaxy tool):</li>
      <li>Generate a reference database
        <ul>
          <li>Blast it on the NR database on <a href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastn&amp;PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&amp;LINK_LOC=blasthome">NCBI Blast</a></li>
          <li>Extracting one similar sequence found with Blast</li>
          <li>Search and extract 2 other sequences of the same species using the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore">NCBI Nucleotide database</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Example 2</strong>: creating a toy dataset from an existing larger one
    <ul>
      <li>When the experiment takes a FASTQ as input and a few reads are sufficient:
        <ul>
          <li>Use <strong>seqtk_sample</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">tool</span> to extract randomly reads from your input fastq.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>However, when it requires a lot of reads to be meaningful, you can use the following strategy (used for the ATAC-seq tutorial using <a href="./workflows/Galaxy-Workflow-MakeAFakeInput.ga">this workflow</a>):
        <ul>
          <li>Run the workflow until the mapping step on the full dataset (or big enough to have good results).</li>
          <li>Select IDs of reads which map on the smallest chromosome (for example chr22 for human data).</li>
          <li>In order to keep in the toy dataset enough diversity, you can also take randomly 1% of the reads IDs.</li>
          <li>Concatenate the two lists and remove the duplicated IDs.</li>
          <li>Use <strong>seqtk_subseq</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">tool</span> to sample your original FASTQ with the list of IDs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We would then develop the tutorial and test it on this toy dataset. Once we were ready to share it, we would upload the datasets to <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a> to store them on long-term and obtain a dedicated DOI in the <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/galaxy-training/?page=1&amp;size=20">Galaxy training network community</a>.</p>

<h1 id="create-the-skeleton-of-the-tutorial">Create the skeleton of the tutorial</h1>

<p>Once we have the workflows and toy dataset (optionally already on Zenodo), we can generate the tutorial folder, including the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tutorial.md</code>.</p>

<p>Writing the tutorial while adding the different tools and their parameters and following good formatting can be quite cumbersome. To help in that process, we developed a training development kit available with <a href="https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Planemo</a>. The tool has several commands. But the main one can be used to create the skeleton of a tutorial (folder, well located, with good structure). It can also take a workflow as input, add it to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">workflows</code> folder. But more interestingly, the tool can extract from the workflow and add in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tutorial.md</code> file the different steps with which tools to run and which parameters to select. If a Zenodo URL is provided, it also creates the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data-library.yaml</code> file.</p>

<p>This tool can be used via the command-line but also via a <a href="https://ptdk.apps.galaxyproject.eu/">webserver</a>. The webserver can take a public workflow that is avialable on <a href="https://usegalaxy.org">usegalaxy.org</a>, <a href="https://usegalaxy.eu">usegalaxy.eu</a> or <a href="https://usegalaxy.org.au">usegalaxy.org.au</a>.</p>
