    <li><strong>Create a fork</strong> of the GTN GitHub repository
      <ul>
        <li>Go on the GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material" width="50%">github.com/galaxyproject/training-material</a></li>
        <li>Click on th Fork button (top-right corner of the page)

        <p>If you already have a fork, fantastic! But a common issue is that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> branch gets outdated, or your fork was from before we renamed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Start by browsing to your fork in GitHub</li>
          <li>Check the default branch that is shown? Does it say <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>? Then you need to update it. (Note - don’t just switch branches from “master” to “main”, follow the instructions below to reset the default branch to “main”.)
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your fork’s settings (Click on the gear icon called “Settings”)</li>
              <li>Find “Branches” on the left</li>
              <li>If it says master you can click on the ⇆  icon to switch branches.</li>
              <li>Select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> (it may not be present).</li>
              <li>If it isn’t present, use the pencil icon to rename <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>.</li>
              <li>Now you can update it in the next step</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Is your fork using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>? Fantastic, but you might need to update it. GitHub has a built in feature for this as shown below:</p>

    <li>Copy the link to your fork of the GTN, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://github.com/shiltemann/training-material</code></li>
    <li>
      <p>In the browser’s address bar, prefix the entire URL with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitpod.io/#</code> and press Enter.</p>

<h1 id="the-gitpod-workspace">The GitPod Workspace</h1>

<p>Let’s have a closer look at the GitPod workspace:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Left:</strong> Here you see all the files in the GTN repository</li>
  <li><strong>Top:</strong> This is the main window where you can view and edit files</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom:</strong> Terminal window. Here you can type commands (e.g. to build the website preview) and read output and error messages.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="build-and-preview-the-gtn-website">Build and preview the GTN website</h1>

<p>Before we start making any changes, let’s build the website and get a live preview.</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>In the terminal window (bottom), type the following command:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make serve-gitpod</code></p>

      <p><a href="../../images/gitpod/command.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/gitpod/command.png" alt="output in the terminal after issuing the make serve-gitpod command. " width="629" height="271" loading="lazy" /></a></p>
    </li>
    <li>The first time you run this command, it will install some dependencies, so it may take a little bit of time (a few minutes)
      <ul>
        <li>Next times will be a lot faster! (~30 seconds)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>When the build process is finished, the terminal will show you a link, and a window should popup with a preview on the right.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>You may need to click ‘Try Again’ to load the GTN.</p>

Some browsers block popups by default, you may need to allow GitPod to show popups in order to click links.</p>

<h1 id="editing-training-materials-on-gitpod">Editing Training Materials on GitPod</h1>

<p>Now that you have the GitPod environment working and we have a live preview up, let’s make some changes to the GTN materials and get an instant preview.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You have spotted a typo in one of the tutorials, and would like to fix this and see the resulting GTN webpage.</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <div class="box-title hands-on-title" id="hands-on-make-and-view-changes"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Hands-on: Make and view changes</div>

  <ol>
    <li>In the preview of the GTN website, open the following tutorial:
      <ul>
        <li>Topic: “Introduction to Galaxy Analyses” topic</li>
        <li>Tutorial: “A Short Introduction to Galaxy””</li>
        <li>We will edit this tutorial and watch the live preview window for the effects</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>On the file browser on the left, open the following file:</p>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-short/tutorial.md
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <blockquote class="tip">

        <p>You can use the key combination <kbd>ctrl-p</kbd> to launch the file search dialog and simply enter the text <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-short/tutorial.md</code></p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>Change the title of the tutorial
      <ul>
        <li><strong>From:</strong> “A Short Introduction to Galaxy”</li>
        <li><strong>To:</strong> “A Short and Cool Introduction to Galaxy”</li>
        <li>You should immediately see a message in the terminal saying “regenerating”. GitPod has detected your changes and is rebuilding the website.
<a href="../../images/gitpod/changes.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/gitpod/changes.png" alt="we changed the title of the tutorial in the text editor window. " width="595" height="191" loading="lazy" /></a>

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Move to the top right panel where the GTN is previewed and refresh the frame
      <ul>
        <li>Firefox: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">right-click -&gt; This Frame -&gt; Reload Frame</code></li>
        <li>Chrome: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">right-click -&gt; Reload frame</code></li>
        <li>You can also open the preview in it’s own brower tab, using the <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">galaxy_instance</span> button at the top-right corner of the preview window. Then you can reload the page the regular way (e.g. <kbd>F5</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl + r</kbd> or the reload button in the browser)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You should see the change you made:
<a href="../../images/gitpod-changed.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/gitpod-changed.png" alt="The updated preview with our changed tutorial title. " width="1727" height="1035" loading="lazy" /></a></li>
  </ol>

</blockquote>

<p>In this way you can edit files in the text editor, and see the effects in the website preview.</p>

<h1 id="saving-your-changes-back-to-github">Saving your changes back to GitHub</h1>

<p>When you have finished your changes, it all looks good in the preview, you want to save your changes back to GitHub so that you can either continue later, or make a Pull Request to the GTN to contribute your changes.</p>

					<b>Liked</b>: Everything is described very extensively and nicely and it's easy to follow

					<b>Liked</b>: step by step, screenshots, global structure of the training content, indications when things seem to get wrong when in fact it is not, good job!
					<b>Disliked</b>: Difficult to know what to do when GitPod sends back an error after the "make serve-gitpod" command instead of serving a preview of GTN. I can guess it is a GitPod problem and not a GTN tutorial problem, still I feel helpless not knowing what to do to solve this problem.
