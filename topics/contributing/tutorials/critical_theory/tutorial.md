Critical Learning Theory (also known as Critical Theory of Education) is rooted in the broader Critical Theory tradition, originated with the Frankfurt School school of thought.

The Frankfurt School, formally known as the Institute for Social Research (Institut für Sozialforschung), is a renowned intellectual and academic hub founded in 1923 at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany. Comprising a group of critical theorists, including Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, and Herbert Marcuse, the Frankfurt School developed Critical Theory as a multidisciplinary approach to understanding and challenging the oppressive dynamics of industrial societies.

In the realm of education, the Critical Learning Theory aligns with the Frankfurt School's tradition, emphasizing a critical analysis of education as a social institution.It represents a framework for critically examinate the role of education in shaping and perpetuating power structures, cultural norms and social inequalities throught the repression of critical thinking. A leading figure of this school of thought is  prominent American-Canadian critical pedagogue Henry Giroux.

Within the realm of Critical Learning Theory, the concept of the hidden curriculum, extensively explored by Giroux, refers to the implicit messages, values, and norms transmitted to students through the informal aspects of the educational system, distinct from the explicit and planned syllabus.

This training aspires to be a introduction on the Critical Learning Theory and the concept of hidden curriculum, with the aim of pointing out which pedagogical elements are the most appropriate to stimulate critical thinking, the backbone of scientific development.

# Contextualising framework

Education is the result of multiple contextual variables that have an effect on their behaviour, ideology and professional development, so it could be said that human beings, as social beings, are educated and transformed by their context ({% cite Careaga2007 %}). In this line, John Dewey, a distinguished American philosopher and advocate for educational reform, beautifully articulated that the the education proposed by
society has its roots in society itself ({% cite Perez2018 %}). Thus, in order to contextualise current educational practices, we can start from the current stage of society, the so-called Information Society.
