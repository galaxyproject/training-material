Critical Learning Theory (also known as Critical Theory of Education) represents a framework that critically examines the role of education in shaping and perpetuating social inequalities, power structures, and cultural norms. 

Rooted in the broader Critical Theory tradition, which originated with the Frankfurt School, Critical Learning Theory applies the principles of critical social theory to educational practices and institutions.

The Frankfurt School, comprising intellectuals such as Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, and Herbert Marcuse, developed Critical Theory as a multidisciplinary approach to understanding and challenging the oppressive dynamics of industrial societies.

In the realm of education, Henry Giroux, a prominent American-Canadian critical pedagogue, has extended and applied these foundational ideas to the field of Critical Learning THeory. Giroux emphasizes the role of education in shaping consciousness and social structures.

Within the realm of Critical Learning Theory, the concept of the hidden curriculum, extensively explored by Giroux, refers to the implicit messages, values, and norms transmitted to students through the informal aspects of the educational system, distinct from the explicit and planned syllabus.

This training aspires to be a introduction on the Critical Learning Theory and the concept of hidden curriculum, with the aim of pointing out which pedagogical elements are the most appropriate to stimulate critical thinking, the backbone of scientific development.

# Contextualising framework

Education is the result of multiple contextual variables that have an effect on their behaviour, ideology and professional development, so it could be said that human beings, as social beings, are educated and transformed by their context ({% cite Careaga2007 %}). In this line, John Dewey, a distinguished American philosopher and advocate for educational reform, beautifully articulated that the the education proposed by
society has its roots in society itself ({% cite Perez2018 %}). Thus, in order to contextualise current educational practices, we can start from the current stage of society, the so-called Information Society.
