# Introduction

The **Critical Learning Theory**  is a pedagogical paradigm rooted in the broader **Critical Theory** tradition originated with the **Frankfurt School** of thought, formally known as the Institute for Social Research (*Institut fÃ¼r Sozialforschung*), an academic hub founded in 1923 at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany. 

Consisting of a renowned collective of critical theorists such as Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, and Herbert Marcuse, the **Frankfurt School** developed the **Critical Theory** as a multidisciplinary approach crafted with the intent to comprehend and actively confront the oppressive dynamics ingrained within industrial societies.

In the realm of education, the **Critical Learning Theory** aligns with the Frankfurt School's tradition, emphasizing a critical analysis of education as a social institution. It represents a framework for critically examinate the role of education in shaping and perpetuating power structures, cultural norms and social inequalities throught the repression of **critical thinking** ({% cite Giroux2018 %}). A leading figure of this school of thought is  prominent American-Canadian critical pedagogue Henry Giroux.

Within the realm of **Critical Learning Theory**, the concept of **Hidden Curriculum**, extensively explored by Giroux, refers to the implicit messages, values, and norms transmitted to students through the informal aspects of the educational system, distinct from the explicit and planned syllabus ({% cite Giroux1988 %}).

This training aspires to be a introduction on the **Critical Learning Theory** and the concept of **Hidden Curriculum**, with the aim of pointing out which pedagogical elements are the most appropriate to stimulate **critical thinking**, the backbone of scientific development.

Education is the result of multiple contextual variables that have an effect on behaviour, ideology and professional development, so it could be said that human beings, as social beings, are educated and transformed by their context ({% cite Careaga2007 %}). In this line, John Dewey, a distinguished American philosopher and advocate for educational reform, beautifully articulated that the education proposed by society has its roots in society itself ({% cite Perez2018 %}). Thus, in order to contextualise current educational practices, we can start by analyzing the current stage of society, the so-called **Information Society**.
