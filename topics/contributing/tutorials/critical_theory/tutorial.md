# Introduction

The **Critical Learning Theory**  is a pedagogical paradigm rooted in the broader **Critical Theory** tradition originated with the **Frankfurt School** of thought, formally known as the Institute for Social Research (*Institut für Sozialforschung*), an academic hub founded in 1923 at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany. 

Consisting of a renowned collective of critical theorists such as Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, and Herbert Marcuse, the **Frankfurt School** developed the **Critical Theory** as a multidisciplinary approach crafted with the intent to comprehend and actively confront the oppressive dynamics ingrained within industrial societies (fig. 1).

In the realm of education, the **Critical Learning Theory** aligns with the Frankfurt School's tradition, emphasizing a critical analysis of educative systems as social institutions. It represents a framework for critically examinate the role of education in shaping and perpetuating power structures, cultural norms and social inequalities throught the repression of **critical thinking** ({% cite Giroux2018 %}). A leading figure of this school of thought is  prominent American-Canadian critical pedagogue Henry Giroux.

Within the realm of **Critical Learning Theory**, the concept of **Hidden Curriculum**, extensively explored by Giroux, refers to the implicit messages, values, and norms transmitted to students through the informal aspects of the educational system, distinct from the explicit and planned syllabus ({% cite Giroux1988 %}).

This training aspires to be a introduction on the **Critical Learning Theory** and the concept of **Hidden Curriculum**, with the aim of pointing out which pedagogical elements are the most appropriate to stimulate **critical thinking**, the backbone of scientific development.

Education is the result of multiple contextual variables that have an effect on behaviour, ideology and professional development, so it could be said that human beings, as social beings, are educated and transformed by their context ({% cite Careaga2007 %}). In this line, John Dewey, a distinguished American philosopher and advocate for educational reform, beautifully articulated that the education proposed by society has its roots in society itself ({% cite Perez2018 %}). Thus, in order to contextualise current educational practices, we can start by analyzing the current stage of society, the so-called **Information Society**.

The **Information Society** is characterised by interrelationships that link individuals through access to and provision of information for the purpose of generating knowledge. According to Esteve in Aprendizaje y Desarrollo Profesional Docente (2009), the **Information Society** needs to increase the number of citizens with high levels of scientific and technical training capable of maintaining the current technological development. But is this true? 

Morgenstern (2005) indicates that the **Information Society** can function with very few, highly qualified and highly paid employees who constitute the decisive core of the companies' activity; the remaining skills are outsourced to other companies, leaving at the bottom a mass of precarious workers whose required competences are often embodied in demands for punctuality, organisational skills, non-conflict and submission to authority (Morgenstern and Finkel, 2005).

## Educative systems

According the **Critical Theory**, educative systems are agents of ideological control linked to the principles and processes that govern the workplace; the dominant culture in educative systems is characterised by selectively ordering and legitimising privileged forms of language, social relations, life experiences and modes of reasoning ({% cite Marcuse1964 %}).

According García Olivo, the criterion governing Western educative systems, in line with OECD recommendations, is none other than that of favouring the adaptation of students to the requirements of the established productive and political apparatus, which requires their psychological and cultural homogenisation ({% cite Olivo2005 %}).

In the face of the conservative claim that educative systems transmit objective knowledge, **Critical Learning Theory** concives knowledge as a particular representation of the dominant culture that structure the hegemonic cosmovision throught a selective process of emphasis and exclusions ({% cite Giroux1988 %}).

Before going deeper, it is inportant to accurately define **critical thinking**, since it is usually concived as a nebulose concepts whose applications appears limitated to specific situations.

The most common definition proviene de la tradición positivista en las ciencias aplicadas; it appeals to the function of teaching students to analyse and develop reading and writing tasks from the perspective of formal logical patterns of coherence, and determining if the conclusions can be derivated from the evaluated data ({% cite Giroux1988 %}). 
In contrast to this superficial and clearly insufficient conception, Gouldner points out that *critical thinking must be capable of questioning even the logic of reasoning itself*, that is, it must be capable of problematising what has hitherto been treated as self-evident, of turning into an object of reflection what had previously been simply a tool (Gouldner, Dialectic of Ideology and technology, 1978).

From the assumption of this conception of critical thinking a new question arises: is it really in the interest of the current Education System to encourage critical thinking? One element that can help to answer this question is the hidden curriculum.

# The hidden curriculum

Unlike the official curriculum, with its explicitly stated cognitive and affective objectives, the hidden curriculum relies
on those organisational aspects of classroom life, such as the communicative systems, whose effects on the learning process are generally not consciously perceived by students ({% cite Olivo2005 %}). On the light of this definition, a new question emerges: which impact has the hidden curriculum on the learning process?

According the **Critical Learning Theory**, what students learn from the formally sanctioned content of the curriculum is much less important than what they learn from the ideological assumptions embodied in the four communicative systems: the curricular system, the system of pedagogical styles of classroom control, the evaluative system, and the technological infraestructure ({% cite Giroux1988 %}, {% cite Anders1980 %}).

## Curricular system

The curricular system is defined as the regulation of the elements that determine the teaching and learning processes for each of the teaching programmes.

According Giroux, the structure, organisation, and content of dominant curricular systems would endow students with the personality needs required in the bureaucratically structured and hierarchically organised workforce ({% cite Giroux1988 %}). Elements such as exposure to a core of common subjects would lead to a dissolution of individuality in the mass, in the collective, to a standardisation and homogenisation of psychologies ({% cite Olivo2005 %}).

## System of pedagogical styles of classroom control

The dominant system of ystem of pedagogical styles of classroom control, the expository discursive mode, represent other of the manifestations of the hidden curriculum. In this discursive mode the sender acts repeatedly on the receiver but gives him/her a passive role (Castejón, España and Ganzarain, 2004). In this case, the hidden curriculum crystallizes as imposition of meanings, which, according to Giroux is intimately linked to its aspiration to depoliticisation ({% cite Giroux1988 %}). Faced with this, we
could ask ourselves: does this aspiration impact in any way on the objectives of fostering critical thinking?

According Marcuse, the education system is political, so aspiring to its politicisation does not imply an inference in its functions ({% cite Marcuse1964 %}). La pretensión de apropiarse de aquellos conceptos que son espontáneamente experimentados como apoliticos representaría un claro ataque al pensamiento crítico, derived from the struggle for ideological-political hegemony(Zizek 2007). In the words of Giroux, when students have little room left to generate their own meanings, learning degenerates into a euphemism for a strategy of control ({% cite Giroux1988 %}).

According the argentininan philosopher Dario Sztajnzrajbe, if there were really an interest in fostering critical thinking, the discursive mode that should dominate in the classroom should be the interrogative one. Questioning is a way of thinking, and that is why thinking is not only deriving conclusions, but often consists of the opposite: starting from the accepted conclusions of a community and turning them upside down (Sztajnzrajber, 2013). 

## Evaluation system

It is in the assessment system that the nature of the hidden curriculum is most clearly revealed. The potential effect of assessment is clearly perceived when it is recognised that both academic and non-academic aspects are taught and assessed, the latter including institutional adaptation and specific personal qualities ({% cite Giroux1988 %}). 

An illustrative example is provided by the research of Bowles and Gintis, who pointed out that students who are best suited to the social ordering of the education system also had significantly below average scores on measures of mental creativity and flexibility (Bowles and Gintis, Schooling in Capitalist America).

Group work is considered one of the most efficient ways to overcome the authoritarian and individualistic nature of the dominant evaluation systems, providing students with social contexts that emphasise social responsibility and group solidarity. No matter how progressive an approach to critical thinking may be, it will squander its own potential if it operates on the basis of a web of social relations in the classroom that are authoritarianly hierarchical and promote passivity, docility and silence (Giroux, 2001).

## Technological infraestructure



# Conclusion

The underlying message assimilated under the practices of the dominant hidden curriculum, which fosters a unidirectional vision of the teaching-learning process, points less to educative system that help students think critically about the world they live in, than to institutions that act as agents of social control. Through the hidden curriculum, students internalise values that emphasise respect for authority, punctuality, cleanliness, docility and conformity.

Critical thinking, conceived as an exercise in questioning and evaluation, is antagonistic to the authoritarian character of the dominant hidden curriculum.
