<p>The GTN has support for JupyterLite and the Pyodide kernel which runs <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/">Python in the browser via webassembly/javascript</a>. This comes with some restrictions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Python only</li>
  <li>No filesystem access (so no <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wget</code> prep steps)</li>
  <li>Little to no cell magic</li>
</ul>

<p>However, it means we can run a lot of our Python training
directly in the GTN! And in the future, hopefully, we will
be able to embed individual cells of the notebook directly
in the Python training, so the user doesn’t even need to
switch pages.</p>

<p>Enabling this field will enable pyolite links for this notebook.</p>

  <p>We recommend that you fill out the <em>questions</em> and the <em>learning objectives</em> before starting writing the tutorial content. You can still refine them afterwards, but it will help to guide you in developing your tutorial, and gives you some time to think beforehand on what topics are worth being covered.</p>

  <p>For the take-home messages, it is easier to define them once the tutorial is written and you identified the issues.</p>

<h1 id="content">Content</h1>

<p>The tutorial’s content is written directly after the section of metadata. This is written in Markdown, a simple markup language.</p>

<blockquote class="comment">
  <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-markdown"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment: Markdown</div>

  <p>Check <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">this cheatsheet</a> to learn more how to use Markdown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Markdown content is then transformed into a user friendly webpage through a templating system. With this approach, there is no need to add the name of every tutorial each time, since they are automatically added based on the tutorial’s metadata.</p>

<p>To help developing the tutorial, we recommend to create a workflow of the different steps of the tutorial inside Galaxy first, and then you can create the structure of the tutorial automatically from that:</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <div class="box-title hands-on-title" id="hands-on-create-the-structure-of-the-tutorial-from-a-workflow"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Hands-on: Create the structure of the tutorial from a workflow</div>

  <ol>
    <li>Create a small workflow with one or two steps on a running Galaxy instance</li>
    <li>Add the topic name as Tag and the tutorial title as Annotation/Notes to the workflow using the workflow editor.</li>
    <li>Get the workflow id
      <ol>
        <li>Go the “Share” page of the workflow</li>
        <li>Copy the information after <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id=</code> in the URL of the page</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Get your API key for this Galaxy instance
      <ol>
        <li>Click on <strong>User</strong> –&gt; <strong>Preferences</strong></li>
        <li>Click on <strong>Manage API key</strong></li>
        <li>Click on <strong>Create a new key</strong> (if none is available)</li>
        <li>Copy the API key</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Generate the skeleton of the tutorial locally</p>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ planemo training_generate_from_wf \
         --topic_name "my-topic" \
         --tutorial_name "my-new-tutorial" \
         --galaxy_url "URL to Galaxy instance in which you created the workflow" \
         --galaxy_api_key "Your API key on the Galaxy instance" \
         --workflow_id "ID of the workflow on the Galaxy instance" \
         --zenodo_link "URL to the Zenodo record (Optional)"
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <blockquote class="comment">
        <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-using-a-local-workflow"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment: Using a local workflow</div>
        <p>It is also possible to download the workflow locally (with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ga</code> extension), and then run a slightly different command:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ planemo training_generate_from_wf \
         --topic_name "my-topic" \
         --tutorial_name "my-new-tutorial" \
         -- workflow PATH/to/the/file.ga \
         --zenodo_link "URL to the Zenodo record (Optional)"
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>Inspect the generated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tutorial.md</code></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The generated tutorial is structured with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An introduction, to give an overview of the tutorial with its use cases, data, and methods</li>
  <li>Multiple sections representing the steps of the analysis, complete with automatically generated hands-on blocks, as practicing is a vital part of the learning process</li>
  <li>A conclusion to summarize what has been done in the tutorial (with a graphic)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <div class="box-title hands-on-title" id="hands-on-filling-out-the-structure-of-the-tutorial"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Hands-on: Filling out the structure of the tutorial</div>

  <ol>
    <li>Fill out the “Introduction” with a general introduction of the tutorial and a small description of the dataset (goals)</li>
    <li>Rename/restructure the sections with several levels and more explication</li>
    <li>Add some theory about the tool used to introduce each section</li>
    <li>Add a small conclusion and relate the results to the original question</li>
  </ol>

<h2 id="self-study-tutorials">Self Study Tutorials</h2>

<p>By following all of the guidelines in this file you can be sure that your tutorial will be optimised for self-study.
The GTN framework encourages the use of snippets, and PTDK ensures tutorials have fully detailed parameters learners should configure.
If you make use of snippets in appropriate places, learners can easily follow a tutorial despite different skill levels with Galaxy.</p>

<p>Additionally use of <a href="#questions-and-solutions-boxes">Question and Solution boxes</a> can ensure that students can self-check their understanding and progress as they progress through the tutorial.
Generally we recommend one or more questions (and associated correct solutions!) after every hands-on box (which might have a one or more steps to follow.)
These questions will let students be sure their work is correct before they proceed too far.
As such you should design your questions carefully in order to catch common and likely failure modes that learners may encounter.
If a student might forget to select a less-common or deeply-nested parameter, be sure that your question following that hands on tests that properly, and if possible explain that in the solutions.</p>

<h2 id="adding-images-with-captions">Adding images with captions</h2>

<p>To add an image in Markdown file, we need to use the markdown syntax for this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!​[proper alt text describing the image for visually impaired learners](../../images/image.png)</code>.</p>

<p>We have also added a small plugin to handle captions for each image:</p>

<figure id="figure-1" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/image_caption_screenshot.png" alt="A textual description of the image. " width="424" height="301" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/image_caption_screenshot.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> Example of an image with a caption</figcaption></figure>
<!-- Adding a space to the caption to not trigger figurigy skip_titles -->

<p>The prefix “Figure 1.” is automatically added before its caption. This is done with the following Markdown syntax:</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>!​<span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">A textual description of the image</span><span class="p">](</span><span class="sx">../images/image.png</span> <span class="nn">"Example of an image with a caption"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can also cross-reference images inside our Markdown with an anchor. For example, we can link to <a href="#figure-1">the previous figure</a> using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[the display text]​(#figure-nb)</code> (changing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nb</code> with the image’s number).</p>

<h3 id="guidelines-on-alt-vs-figcaption-text">Guidelines on Alt vs Figcaption Text</h3>

<blockquote class="quote" cite="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/alt-vs-figcaption" author="thoughtbot.com">
  <p>While both the alt attribute and the figcaption element provide a way to
describe images, the way we write for them is different. <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> descriptions
should be functional; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">figcaption</code> descriptions should be editorial or
illustrative.</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>As an example for this image:</p>

<figure id="figure-2" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="/training-material/topics/microbiome/images/plasmid-metagenomics-nanopore/sequence_method.jpg" alt="alt text.

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>!​<span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">Alt text (shown when image cannot be displayed)</span><span class="p">](</span><span class="sx">path/to/image.png</span> <span class="nn">"Example of an image with a caption"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<h2 id="writing-mathematical-expressions">Writing mathematical expressions</h2>

<p>Mathematical expressions can be written in LaTeX, and are automatically rendered with <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>.</p>

<p>Surround your math expression with two <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> signs on each side (like in LaTeX math blocks):</p>

<ul>
  <li>inline expressions, <em>e.g.</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$ 5 + 5 $$</code> will be rendered as \(5 + 5\)</li>
  <li>
    <p>block expressions, <em>e.g.</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$ 5 + 5 $$</code> will be rendered in its own line block as</p>

\[5 + 5\]
  </li>
  <li>Note: if inline mode is not working correctly, you can force it by using the following delimiters instead of dollar signs: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\\( 5 +5 \\)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Dollar signs are therefore <em>reserved characters</em> for instructing the templating system to open/close LaTeX math blocks. If you want to use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> within your expression, you will need to <em>escape</em> it: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$ a + 3\$ = 5\$ $$</code> will be rendered as: \(a + 3\$ = 5\$\)</p>

<p>LaTeX code that uses the pipe symbol <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code> in inline math statements may lead to a line being recognized as a table line by the templating system.
This can be avoided by using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\vert</code> command instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code></p>

<h2 id="tables-and-matrices">Tables and Matrices</h2>

<p>Tables can be generated using markdown by using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code> symbol to indicate column dividers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--</code> for table headers:</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>|       | Obs1 | Obs2 | Obs3 |
|------ |--------------------|
| Feat1 | 0    | 1    | 2    |
| Feat2 | 1    | 2    | 3    |
| Feat3 | 2    | 3    | 4    |
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When rendered, they will take the full width of the page:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th> </th>
      <th>Obs1</th>
      <th>Obs2</th>
      <th>Obs3</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Feat1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Feat2</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Feat3</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This does not appear to be visually appealing when representing matrices, which is why a matrix box can be used instead:</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gt">&gt; |       | Obs1 | Obs2 | Obs3 |</span>
<span class="gt">&gt; | ----- |--------------------|</span>
<span class="gt">&gt; | Feat1 | 0    | 1    | 2    |</span>
<span class="gt">&gt; | Feat2 | 1    | 2    | 3    |</span>
<span class="gt">&gt; | Feat3 | 2    | 3    | 4    |</span>
{: .matrix}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The rendered table is then given as a minimum-width and centred matrix:</p>

<blockquote class="matrix">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th> </th>
        <th>Obs1</th>
        <th>Obs2</th>
        <th>Obs3</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Feat1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Feat2</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Feat3</td>
        <td>2</td>

<h1 id="improving-the-learning-experience-with-boxes">Improving the learning experience with Boxes</h1>

<p>To improve the learning experience in our tutorial, we define some boxes to highlight content.</p>

<p>These boxes are defined always with the same structure:</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gt">&gt; &lt;type​-title&gt;Name of the box&lt;/type​-title&gt;</span>
<span class="gt">&gt; text goes here!</span>
{: .type}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>where type is something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tip</code>, so <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;tip-title&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{: .tip}</code>. You must follow this structure <strong>exactly</strong> for it to be rendered correctly.</p>

<h2 id="overview-box"><strong>Overview</strong> box</h2>

<p>This box at the top of each tutorial is automatically generated using the metadata we defined in the topic’s metadata file:</p>

<h2 id="agenda-box"><strong>Agenda</strong> box</h2>

<p>There is no need to fill out the list; this will be done automatically based off of your tutorial’s section titles. First and second level headings (lines starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">##</code> in markdown) will be shown in the agenda.</p>

<p>If a section is not important enough to be shown in the agenda, consider making it a third-level heading (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">###</code>) instead.</p>

<p>The agenda will be rendered as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="agenda">

<h2 id="hands-on-box"><strong>Hands-on</strong> box</h2>

<p>We find that having users walk through the tutorial, doing all of the steps is important for learning the concepts taught. We therefore emphasize this by regularly adding hands-on sections, where trainees are encouraged to do the analysis by themselves. We have designed some special boxes to make these sections easier to find.</p>

<p>There are also some predefined <strong>parameter icons</strong> available which can be used to indicate the <em>type</em> of parameter. These are optional,

<p>Questions should be quick to answer. You can directly ask a question and expect an answer, or you can provide some answers and create multiple choices questions (MCQs).
With well chosen wrong answers, MCQs can do much more than just measure how much someone knows, such as exposing common misconceptions and mistakes.</p>

<h1 id="additional-features-to-improve-learning">Additional Features to Improve Learning</h1>

<p>Here we cover additional features you can use throughout your tutorials to improve the learning experience.</p>

<h2 id="tool-links">Tool Links</h2>

<p>With the new <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/10024">GTN in Galaxy Webhook</a>, trainees can view training directly within Galaxy. As part of this, we enable those trainees to click on tools, and have those tools directly activated in Galaxy, enabling for a seamless training experience for trainees.</p>

<figure id="figure-3" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/88277962-ddda4a80-cce1-11ea-92cd-41b1df063db0.gif" alt="GIF of a user using the GTN in Galaxy webhook." width="1722" height="1036" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/88277962-ddda4a80-cce1-11ea-92cd-41b1df063db0.gif" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 3</strong>:</span> A gif showing how the GTN in Galaxy webhook works. A student clicks the learning hat icon in the masthead of a Galaxy server, and an overlay is activated showing the GTN website. Within the GTN they can browse around and their place in tutorials is saved. While following a tutorial the student reches a step which instructs them to run a specific tool. Instead of the normal experience searching for a tool (quite difficult on large servers), they click a blue button and the tool is activated in Galaxy, and the overlay is closed. The student can reactivate the overlay at any time and return to their place in the tutorial.</figcaption></figure>

<p>To enable these in your tutorial you can use the following syntax:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- {% tool MultiQC %}
- {% tool [MultiQC](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/multiqc/multiqc/1.8+galaxy0) %}
- {% tool [Import some data](upload1) %}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which will be rendered as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><span><strong>MultiQC</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i></span></li>
  <li><span class="tool" data-tool="toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/multiqc/multiqc/1.8+galaxy0" title="MultiQC tool" aria-role="button"><i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>MultiQC</strong> (<i class="fas fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> Galaxy version 1.8+galaxy0)</span></li>
  <li><span class="tool" data-tool="upload1" title="Import some data tool" aria-role="button"><i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Import some data</strong></span></li>
</ul>

<p>When viewed through Galaxy, students will see:</p>

<p><span data-tool="upload1" title="Tested with upload1" class="tool galaxy-proxy-active"><strong>Import some data</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i><i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cog"></i><span class="visually-hidden">Tool: upload1</span></span></p>

<h3 id="how-to-find-these-ids">How to find these IDs?</h3>

<p>The easiest way is to use planemo to generate the training from a workflow. In recent versions of planemo, this is managed automatically.</p>

<p>The alternative is to figure out the ID for the tool you want to use:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find your tool in Galaxy, and click to access the tool form.</li>
  <li>Click on Options at the top right</li>
  <li>Click on Share</li>
  <li>The URL shown will be something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/galaxyp/mz_to_sqlite/mz_to_sqlite/2.0.4+galaxy1</code></li>
  <li>Keep only the part after the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code>, so <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/galaxyp/mz_to_sqlite/mz_to_sqlite/2.0.4+galaxy1</code> in this example</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="example-histories">Example Histories</h2>

<p>If you have example input histories for your tutorial, perhaps for specific servers where trainees will often follow a tutorial but want to skip a slow input step, then you can provide example histories as part of your tutorial.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="workflows">Workflows</h2>

<p>In some tutorials you aren’t as interested in teaching users the individual steps for analysing data, but rather want to focus on some downstream aspects of analysis, or to showcase the best practice workflows that are already available for a user to use! In those cases it can be useful to have a nicer way of inviting the user to execute those steps.</p>

<p>If you are accessing these in tutorial mode, they should function as button that, when clicked, launch the workflow directly. Outside of tutorial mode, they will link to our redirection service which will let you supply which Galaxy you plan to use.</p>

<p>Note that if for some reason the ‘fancy’ method doesn’t work, there are fallback tip boxes to help a user execute a similar procedure manually.</p>

<h3 id="gtn-workflows">GTN Workflows</h3>

<p>If you’ve included the workflow in the GTN but haven’t uploaded to a repository yet:</p>

<p>This snippet has the same behaviour, it will use my.galaxy.training links to make them server independent, but in Tutorial Mode it will open on the current server.</p>

<h2 id="faqs-snippets">FAQs (snippets)</h2>

<p>Many common questions or instructions may be useful to share between different tutorials. For example instructions on how to start a new history or importing data. To make these types of snippets easier to re-use and avoid duplication, they are available in the form of <em>snippets</em>.</p>

In this situation as students do not have a teacher immediately on hand, and likely do not have friends or colleagues sitting working with them, they will rely on these boxes to refresh their knowledge and know what to do.</p>   <p>Please ensure you test your learning materials with a learner or colleague not familiar the material, and if possible, (<strong>silently</strong>) watch them go through your lesson. You’ll easily identify which portions need more explanations and details.</p> </blockquote>

<h3 id="including-faqssnippets-in-your-tutorials">Including FAQs/snippets in your tutorials</h3>

<p>To include one of these snippets in your tutorial, you can use the following syntax:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{% snippet faqs/galaxy/histories_create_new.md %}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which will be rendered as:</p>

<!--SNIPPET-->
<blockquote class="tip">   <div class="box-title tip-title" id="tip-creating-a-new-history"><button class="gtn-boxify-button tip" type="button" aria-controls="tip-creating-a-new-history" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true"></i> <span>Tip: Creating a new history</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>   <p>To create a new history simply click the <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">new-history</span> icon at the top of the history panel:</p>   <p><img src="/training-material/shared/images/history_create_new.svg" alt="UI for creating new history" /></p>   <!-- the original drawing can be found here https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1cCBrLAo4kDGic5QyB70rRiWJAKTenTU8STsKDaLcVU8/edit?usp=sharing --> </blockquote>
<p><!--END_SNIPPET--></p>

<p>The advantage of this approach is that when the Galaxy interface updates, we only have to update the snippet, rather than every tutorial. Please try to use snippets whenever you can!</p>

<p>You could also specify the box type you want the snippet to be rendered in:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{% snippet faqs/galaxy/histories_create_new.md box_type="hands_on" %}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Do you want to include something in your tutorial that you think might be useful in other tutorials as well? Or are you answering a frequently asked question? Consider creating a snippet for it</p>

<p>Each snippet (question) is a separate file, with some metadata, residing in one of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">faqs</code> folders:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>

<span class="na">box_type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">tip</span>        <span class="c1"># tip/comment/hands_on/question; optional, if you want the content to be in a box</span>
<span class="na">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">faq</span>          <span class="c1"># if you set this the snippet will get its own page and be included in the FAQs page</span>

This will help other learners as they progress through the materials, and can give you a very easy URL to point your learners to if they get stuck on a particular task.</p> </blockquote>
<p><!--END_SNIPPET--></p>

<h3 id="faq-pages">FAQ pages</h3>

<p>All FAQs will also be collected on their own page, this makes it easy for and teachers to prepare the session, and for participants to quickly find the answers to common questions.</p>

<p>To do this, create a file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.md</code> inside the faq folder:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="na">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">faq-page</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you would like to enforce an order of the faq areas, you can do so:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="na">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">faq-page</span>
<span class="na">area_order</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">[</span><span class="nv">introduction</span><span class="pi">,</span> <span class="nv">learners</span><span class="pi">,</span> <span class="nv">instructors</span><span class="pi">,</span> <span class="nv">contributors</span><span class="pi">,</span> <span class="nv">other</span><span class="pi">]</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(just make sure you list all existing areas in the folder)</p>

<p>If a tutorial-level FAQ page exists (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">topics/&lt;topic&gt;/tutorials/&lt;tutorial&gt;/faqs/index.md</code>) it will be automatically linked to from the overview box at the top of the tutorial, and at the end of the tutorial. Have a look at this tutorial to see it in action.</p>

<h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2>

<blockquote class="code-2col">
  <blockquote class="code-in">

</code></pre></div>    </div>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="icons">Icons</h2>

<p>To use these icons, take the name of the icon, ‘details’ in this example, and write something like this in your tutorial:</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{% icon details %}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some icons have multiple aliases, any may be used, but we’d suggest trying to choose the most semantically appropriate one in case Galaxy later decides to change the icon.</p>

<h2 id="abbreviations">Abbreviations</h2>

<p>Oftentimes there are terms you’ll use over and over again where there is an acronym or abbreviation you’ll use consistently. However for learners new to the material, they might need to scroll up to the first definition every time to remember what it meant. It would be annoying as an author to have to re-define it every time, so we’ve implemented some very simple syntax to allow you to create a list of definitions and then use those in the text.</p>

<p>In your tutorial metadata you can add an abbreviations section like:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">My awesome tutorial</span>
<span class="nn">...</span>
<span class="na">abbreviations</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">API</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Application Programming Interface</span>
  <span class="na">JSON</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">JavaScript Object Notation</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And in your text you can use braces to refer to the term</p>

<blockquote class="code-2col">
  <blockquote class="code-in">
    <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-markdown-1"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Markdown</div>
    <p><code>
The `/jobs` &lbrace;API&rbrace; will return &lbrace;JSON&rbrace;. When we call the &lbrace;API&rbrace; we'll get back this result &lbrace;JSON&rbrace;.
</code></p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote class="code-out">
    <div class="box-title code-out-title" id="code-out-3"><i class="fas fa-laptop-code" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Output</div>

    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/jobs</code> Application Programming Interface (API) will return JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). When we call the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> we’ll get back this result <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="choose-your-own-tutorial">Choose Your Own Tutorial</h2>

<p>Sometimes you’re writing a large tutorial and at one small step there are multiple paths or multiple ways to get the data you want, and you’d like to showcase them all! You could write them all out in order, Option 1…2…etc, however maybe you want it to be a bit more interactive and focus only on one option at a time, so a user doesn’t get distracted by the other options.</p>

<p>Include this markdown where you want your user to choose between the multiple paths:</p>

<blockquote class="code-in">

       text="Here is why some people choose Ananas. Other times you want Avocados as they fit the menu better." %}
</code></pre></div>  </div>

<p>And then they can wrap the relevant sections with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">div</code> block with the relevant class. You <strong>must</strong> set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">markdown="1"</code> as well to have the inner contents rendered corretly.</p>

<p><strong>NB</strong>: If you do not set a default, then on the very first page load, both options will be shown in their entirety. As soon as the user selects one of the options by clicking the relevant button, then the list is filtered. The user’s browser generally will remember which button was selected across navigation and page reloads.</p>

  <p>If you wish to have multiple CYOAs in a single tutorial, you are free to do that! However you must:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Ensure that all options are disjoint, there should not be any shared terms! (I.e if the both CYOAs need to use “STAR”, please find a different way to phrase it, or even use “STAR “, it just needs to be different.)</li>
    <li>Provide a disambiguation term for them, passed as a parameter to all, or all but one, includes.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This disambiguation term will affect the URL parameter, which will become <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?gtn-cyoa{term}={value}</code></p>

  <p>E.g.:</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
{% include _includes/cyoa-choices.html option1="Oui" option2="Non" default="Oui" text="Vos données ESTAMP sont prêtes ?" %}

<h3 id="url-parameter">URL Parameter</h3>

<p>The branch can be selected via URL parameter e.g. for courses, to prevent users selecting the wrong path. Just supply <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?gtn-cyoa=Ananas</code> (or your preferred value) on the tutorial URL.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="?gtn-cyoa=Ananas#choose-your-own-tutorial">See this page with Ananas</a></li>

<h1 id="automatic-jupyter-notebooks--rmarkdown">Automatic Jupyter Notebooks &amp; RMarkdown</h1>

<p>If your tutorial is primarily focused on teaching students how to write code (Bash, Python, SQL, etc) you can take advantage of the GTN’s ability to automatically export notebooks from the tutorial content! In this system, you pick a <em>single</em> language for your tutorial, and then all code blocks tagged with that language become runnable. E.g.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Here is some explanation

<p>Every cell that you wish to be executable, needs to be annotated with the language like above. Then if a compatible notebook can be produced, it will be.</p>

<h2 id="restrictions">Restrictions</h2>

<p>To use this system, you need to take care of a few things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do <strong>not</strong> use hands-on boxes for segments that should be executed (code needs to be left aligned!)</li>
  <li>Do <strong>not</strong> use snippets</li>
  <li>Do <strong>not</strong> use icons <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{% icon galaxy-eye %}</code></li>
  <li>Do not use a terminal or prompt character (that would be included in the execution.)</li>
  <li>Avoid including output when you can, it doesn’t render nicely especially when the cells will become runnable.</li>
</ul>

<p>And be aware that the output will look a little bit different than the GTN, e.g. solution boxes cannot be hidden by default, so in Jupyter notebook we format the text with a colour of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">white</code> so it does not appear in the notebook and requires selection to view the answer.</p>

<p><em>However there are things that are possible!</em> You can still use question/solution boxes, or otherwise nested boxes. Just not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">includes</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">snippets</code></p>

<h2 id="enabling-the-system">Enabling the system</h2>

<p>Add metadata to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tutorial.md</code> header like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>notebook:
  language: python
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Supported values are python, sql, r, and bash. The notebook will be generated automatically as part of the site build process.</p>

<h2 id="jupyterlite--pyodide">JupyterLite &amp; Pyodide</h2>

<p>The GTN has support for JupyterLite and the Pyodide kernel which runs <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/">Python in the browser via webassembly/javascript</a>. This comes with some restrictions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Python only<sup id="fnref:pyonly" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pyonly" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>No filesystem access (so no <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wget</code> prep steps)</li>
  <li>Little to no cell magic</li>
</ul>

<p>However, it means we can run a lot of our Python training directly in the GTN! And in the future, hopefully, we will be able to embed individual cells of the notebook directly in the Python training, so the user doesn’t even need to switch pages.</p>

<p>To enable this feature, set:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>notebook:
  language: python
  pyolite: true
</code></pre></div></div>

<h1 id="spanish-translation-project">Spanish Translation Project</h1>

<p>We have started <a href="/training-material/news/2021/05/20/spanish_project_begins.html">a trial for translating tutorials into Spanish</a>. Below are instructions on how to add translations of slides and/or hands-on tutorials in Spanish.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Add a new file</strong> with the translated material, next to the English version.
    <ul>
      <li>Add suffix <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_ES</code> suffix
        <ul>
          <li>i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tutorial_ES.md</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slides_ES.html</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Add metadata</strong> to the <strong>English version</strong> (at the top of the file):
    <div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="na">tags</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">español</span>
  <span class="na">translations</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">es</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Add metadata</strong> to the <strong>translated version</strong> of the file:
    <div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="na">lang</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">es</span>
  <span class="na">translations</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">en</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If all worked well, it should look something like this, with a dropdown menu on the slides and/or tutorial showing the presence of a curated tutorial:</p>

<p><a href="../../images/curated-translations.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/curated-translations.png" alt="example of the view in the topic page for a tutorial with a Spanish translation. " width="701" height="416" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

The note can provide an author’s comments on the main text or citations of a reference work in support of the text. Footnotes are notes at the foot of the page while endnotes are collected under a separate heading at the end of a chapter, volume, or entire work. Unlike footnotes, endnotes have the advantage of not affecting the layout of the main text, but may cause inconvenience to readers who have to move back and forth between the main text and the endnotes.” <a href="#fnref:test" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a> <a href="#fnref:test:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;<sup>2</sup></a></p>
