The use of snippets is **extremely** important for asynchronous, remote learning. In this situation as students do not have a teacher immediately on hand, and likely do not have friends or colleagues sitting working with them, they will rely on these boxes to refresh their knowledge and know what to do.

Please ensure you test your learning materials with a learner or colleague not familiar the material, and if possible, (**silently**) watch them go through your lesson. You'll easily identify which portions need more explanations and details.
