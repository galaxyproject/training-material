There are two ways to do this:
 1. Use [planemo](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on your local machine. Please see the tutorial named ["Creating a new tutorial"]({% link topics/contributing/tutorials/create-new-tutorial/tutorial.md %}) for detailed instructions.
 2. Use our [web service](https://ptdk.apps.galaxyproject.eu/)
