The tutorial has been specifically adapted to the rules and options available in GTN. However, the general FAIR-by-Design Methodology is platform agnostic and can be applied to any environment. 

Thus, the tutorial can be reused and carefully adapted to be applicable to other platforms, as long as the adaptation is based on the originally published FAIR-by-Design Methodology.
