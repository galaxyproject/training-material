There is no specific certification regarding the implementation of the FAIR-by-Design Methodology when developing learning materials for GTN.

There is, however, the possibility to obtain FAIR-by-Design per stages and overall badge based on the Training of Trainers learning materials prepared by the Skills4EOSC project.

To obtain this certification follow the [FAIR-by-Design Learning Materials Methodology Course](https://learning.skills4eosc.eu/course/view.php?id=19) and make sure you successfully pass all of the assessments.
