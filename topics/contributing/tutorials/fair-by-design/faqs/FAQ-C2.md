The FAIR-by-Design Methodology stages can be relatively easily adapted to the processes for designing other FAIR objects. 

For an example, the FAIR-by-Design Methodology can be adapted to create FAIR-by-Design software objects. This has been demonstrated on the IDCC24 W6 - FAIR-by-Design: introducing Skills4EOSC and FAIR-IMPACT workshop. The information regarding this example is available at [https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/IDCC24workshop/latest/](https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/IDCC24workshop/latest/).
