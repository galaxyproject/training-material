### Adopt a metadata schema

If you are not using a discipline specific metadata schema, then, to ensure that your learning materials are appropriately described using a common approach, you should adopt the:

  <a href="https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_ToT/latest/Stage%201%20%E2%80%93%20Prepare/02-Preparing%20FAIR%20Learning%20Objects/02-Preparing%20FAIR%20Learning%20Objects/#rda-minimal-metadata-for-learning-resources" class="btn btn-primary stretched-link">Go to the RDA Minimal Metadata Set for Learning Resources description details</a>

The following are the fields described in the RDA Minimal Metadata Set divided into three categories:

> <details-title>Descriptive info metadata fields</details-title>
> - **Title** =	The human readable name of the resource
> - **Abstract / Description** =	A brief synopsis about or description of the learning resource
> - **Author(s)** =	Name of entity(ies) authoring the resource
> - **Primary Language** =	Language in which the resource was originally published or made available
> - **Keyword(s)** =	Keywords or tags used to describe the resource
> - **Version Date** =	Version date for the most recently published or broadcast resource
{: .details}

> <details-title>Access info metadata fields</details-title>
> - **URL to Resource** =	URL that resolves to the learning resource or to a "landing page" for the resource that contains important contextual information including the direct resolvable link to the resource, if applicable.
> - **Resource URL Type**	 = Designation of the identifier scheme used for the resource URL, e.g., DOI, ARK, Handle
> - **License** =	A license document that applies to this content, typically indicated by URL
> - **Access Cost**	= Choice stating whether or not there is a fee for use of the resource (yes, no, maybe)
{: .details}

> <details-title>Educational info metadata fields</details-title>
> - **Target Group (Audience)** =	Principal users(s) for which the resource was designed
> - **Learning Resource Type** =	The predominant type or kind that characterizes the learning resource
> - **Learning Outcome** =	Descriptions of what knowledge, skills or abilities a learner should acquire on completion of the resource
> - **Expertise (Skill) Level** =	Target skill level in the topic being taught; example values include beginner, intermediate, advanced

## Stage 2 - Discover

> Greater even than the greatest discovery is to keep open the way to future discovery.
{: .quote author="John Jacob Abel"}
### Get inspired

Reusable materials can be found anywhere. These are just some examples:

**GTN**

- [GTN learning resources](https://training.galaxyproject.org)
- [TeSS Catalogue by Elixir](https://tess.elixir-europe.org)

**OER**

- [DOAB](https://directory.doabooks.org/)

- [OERTX CORA](https://www.projectcora.org/)
- [GALILEO](https://oer.galileo.usg.edu/)
- [FORRT](https://forrt.org/)

**EOSC**

- [EOSC Training catalogue on the EOSC Marketplace](https://search.marketplace.eosc-portal.eu/search/training?q=*)
- Most EOSC projects have their own training catalogues and/or platforms.

**General**

- [Creative Commons Search](https://search.creativecommons.org/) - content provided under a CC license
- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) - a multi-disciplinary open repository
- [OSF](https://osf.io/) - a free, open research platform

### Potential for reuse

> <warning-title> Respect the licenses, to be respected!</warning-title>
> - Materials with non-permissible licenses can be used for inspiration only.
> - Materials with permissible licenses should be reused based on the license rules.
{: .warning}

### Don't forget the multimedia search

Different learners have different learning modalities (read/write, auditory, visual, kinesthetic). To elevate the learning experience you should use all types of multimedia in your learning materials.

[Go to the full description of FAIR-by-Design Methodology: Discover stage ...](https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_Book/4%20-%20FAIR-by-design%20learning%20materials%20creation/4.1%20-%20Workflow%20stages%20description/412-discover/){: .btn.btn-dark.text-white.stretched-link}

## Stage 3 - Design

> Design is intelligence made visible.
{: .quote author="Alina Wheeler"}

Now it's time to brainstorm.

### Concept map

Step 1: Build a concept map of your learning materials.

> <details-title>More details on concept maps</details-title>
> [Read about Concept Maps in the Design and plan session, course, materials tutorial available on GTN]( {% link topics/contributing/tutorials/design/tutorial.md#concept-maps %} )
{: .details}

Step 2: Make sure you align your concept map with the MVS profiles.

The aligned MVS profile can help you crystallize the learning objectives using the MVS taxonomy.

Each MVS profile defines a list of technical and soft skills required for the profile. Think on how to incorporate both aspects in your learning materials.

> <tip-title>Granular versioning for easy rollback</tip-title>
>    - Versioning helps you maintain control over your changes.
>    - GitHub natively provides versioning and history retention that help easy roll back to an earlier stable state.
{: .tip}

> <tip-title>Open file formats to foster reuse</tip-title>
> - For other people to reuse the materials they should be made available using open file formats.
> - GTN promotes the use of the MD open file format for the main learning content empowered with open scientific notebooks and workflows.
> - If you use close file formats then you MUST clearly state the tools that have been used in more details.
{: .tip}

> <tip-title>Multimodal content to reach all audience</tip-title>
>  - Don't forget to include different types of multimedia to provide support for different learning modalities: read/write, auditory, visual, kinesthetic.
>  - In addition to hands-on exercises, GTN also provides support for audio and video modalities.
{: .tip}

> <tip-title>Two file sets: editable + final</tip-title>
> - The MD and supporting files are the main files used for development of the content. These files are what matters for you and other instructors.
> - Based on the editable files, GTN automatically generates the final (non-editable version) in HTML (and PDF). These  are shared with the learners.
> - GTN takes care of the revision numbering for you.
{: .tip}

> <tip-title>Don't forget to take advantage of co-creation</tip-title>
> Truly FAIR learning materials enable co-creation with external parties.
>  GitHub is a collaborative environment that supports co-creation in every step of the learning materials development and revision process.
>  The GTN fork-and-pull process of contributing to the learning material is a clear example of co-creation implementation.

The existing materials you are reusing are available under a [CC license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/), but it is different than the one you plan to use for your materials. Depending on how you want to reuse the material, you will need to consider the following aspects.

><details-title>I want to reuse it as a whole</details-title>
>- You can't use something that is licensed with ND (no derivatives).
>- In this case you must follow the rules on combining and adapting CC material.
>

{: .details}

><details-title>I want to reuse a small part of it</details-title>
> No problem, you can reuse any existing CC licensed material in your learning materials as long as the reused portion is used as a showcase or to make a specific point and it is not the core of your work.
>
> Remember that if the work is licensed with ND, you can not modify it while reusing.

#### Attribute

All CC licenses require that you attribute the author, and this rule is recommended even if the license is public domain CC-0.

If the work you are reusing has a copyright notice ('© some text') you need to reproduce it while you credit the work.

You should also be able to remove attribution upon request.

##### How to attribute?

> <solution-title>Use the authors recommended attribution</solution-title>

### Accessibility

The developed learning materials should cover the widest range of learner variability including the ones that use or do not use assistive technology.

![Universal access logo](../../images/universal-access-6602642_640.png)
<a href="https://pixabay.com/vectors/universal-access-human-icon-6602642/">"Universal Access Human"</a> by <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/inspire-studio-22128832/">J S</a> from <a href="https://pixabay.com/">Pixabay</a>


#### Standards

There are several standards that govern the rules on the level of accessibility.

Most commonly used is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standard version 2.1</a>. Three conformance levels exist, you should aim for AA which is the middle one.

PDF document accessibility is measured with a separate technical specification <a href="https://pdfua.foundation/en/why-pdf-ua/">PDF/UA (Universal Accessibility)</a>.

## Stage 5 - Publish

> Publishing is the art of working on a creative idea and turning it into a masterpiece!
{: .quote author="Unknown"}

><warning-title>Publishing closed FAIR materials</warning-title>
> Having FAIR learning materials does not always mean that the materials are open to everyone and there are no costs or access rules attached. In this case the bundle that is going to be published in an open repository such as Zenodo should contain the following:
>  1. Syllabus, that contains all metadata that describe the materials. Metadata should always be open.
>  2. Accompanying information (optional) to augment the description of the materials and describe the details when it comes to accessing and using the materials from a trainer perspective.
>
> The complete learning materials package itself should be published in a closed repository where the corresponding access rules (and costs) can be implemented.

### FAIR or not FAIR, that is the question

#### Measure FAIRness

Use the [FAIR-by-Design methodology QA checklist](https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_ToT/latest/Stage%206%20–%20Verify/19-Final%20QA%20check/19-finalQA/#fair-by-design-methodology-qa-checklist) to check if you have followed the most important aspects of the methodology and managed to produce FAIR learning materials.

The questions marked as essential achieve bare minimum FAIRness.

><details-title>Essential requirements</details-title>
> - **Findable**
>   - Is the complete learning resource (including instructors info) registered or indexed in at least one searchable repository? Is it in a FAIR repository?
>   - Is metadata for the resource provided in both human- and machine-readable format (e.g JSON, XMLor YAML)?
> - **Accessible**
>   - Has an accessibility checker tool been utilised to improve the accessibility of all learning resource files (PDF, HTML, video, etc.)?
>   - Are access rules (authentication & authorisation) implemented for the learning resource?
> - **Interoperable**
>   - Is the RDA minimal (or domain specific) metadata schema used for the learning material description?
>   - Is the resource available in open file formats which are tool agnostic and compatible with a wide variety of existing software?
> - **Reusable**
>   - Is there clear attribution for all reused resources with compatible licenses?
>   - Has the learning resource been made available for use by defining a permissable license or policy information that allows derivations?
{: .details}

><details-title>Optional requirements</details-title>
> - Did you follow the stages of the backward instructional design process while developing the learning resource?
> - Are controlled vocabularies (CVs) used for describing the resource characteristics aligned with the chosen metadata schema?
> - Does the learning resource represent a complete learning object defined around minimum one learning objective?
> - Does the resource incorporate an instructor kit that aids in facilitating the process of others reusing learning material by offering helpful how-to guides?
>    - facilitator guide
>    - activities description
>    - assessment activities and strategy to assess
>    - general learning content or instructor notes
>    - lesson unit plan
>    - syllabus
> - Have you employed a versioning system to track and control changes in your materials?
> - Are the resource access rules (how to access, e.g. registration procedure) explicitly communicated to learners?
> - Is the learning resource searchable in at least one relevant catalogue?
>    - Is it FAIR (can be searched based on metadata)?
> - Does the course include the possibility to provide feedback or comments from users and-or trainers/designers?
>    - If so, do you regularly gather and analyse that feedback?
> - Does the resource adopt an open community approach regarding its quality and reachability?
> - Has the learning resource been checked by a third party regarding its learning experience quality?
