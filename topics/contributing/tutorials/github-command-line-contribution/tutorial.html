<h1 id="clone-the-github-repository-on-your-computer">Clone the GitHub repository on your computer</h1>

<p>To modify the content of the repository, you need a copy of it on your computer. This step of importing a git repository is called “cloning”:</p>

        <li>
          <p>Click on <strong>Code</strong> (right)</p>

<h1 id="create-a-new-branch">Create a new branch</h1>

<p>You have now your repository locally and you want to modify it. For this example tutorial, you will add yourself as contributor of the project to appear on the <a href="/training-material/hall-of-fame.html">Hall of Fame</a>.</p>

<p>In GitHub flow, there is a concept: one new feature or change = one branch.</p>

<p>When you’re working on a project, you’re going to have a bunch of different features or ideas in progress at any given time – some of which are ready to go, and others which are not. Branching exists to help you manage this workflow. You should develop different features on different branches to help keep the changes you make simple and easy to review.</p>

<figure id="figure-4" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/PR_branches_01.png" alt="Divergence of a branch compared to main.

Changes you make on a branch don't affect the main branch</figcaption></figure>

<p>Here for this tutorial, you will create a branch called “my_new_branch” in which you will modify the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CONTRIBUTORS.yaml</code> file, the file used to generate the <a href="/training-material/hall-of-fame.html">Hall of Fame</a>.</p>

<h1 id="check-the-automatic-tests">Check the automatic tests</h1>

<p>When a pull request is opened, some automated tests are automatically launched on <a href="http://travis-ci.com/">Travis</a> to be sure that the changes do not break the website, the URL are valid, etc.</p>

<p>On the bottom of your pull request, you can see the status of the tests:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Yellow (with circle)</p>

    <p><a href="../../images/PR_test_yellow.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/PR_test_yellow.png" alt="Running. " width="696" height="93" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

    <p>The tests are still running</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red (with cross)</p>

    <p><a href="../../images/PR_test_red.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/PR_test_red.png" alt="Failed tests. " width="698" height="94" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

    <p>When it is red, you can investigate why by clicking on <strong>Details</strong>. You will be redirected on <a href="http://travis-ci.com/">Travis</a> where you can see the logs of the tests. Get in touch with us on <a href="https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby">Gitter</a> if you need help to understand the issue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Green (with tick)</p>

    <p>The tests passed. Good job!</p>

    <p>Even it is green, we recommend to check the result of the tests, as some of tests are allowed to fail (to avoid too much noise).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="stay-up-to-date">Stay up to date</h1>

<p>You now want to work on a new tutorial or make some other new changes. However since you get a local copy, some changes have happened to the original GitHub repository. You need then to update your local copy of the repository before changing anything.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Move to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> branch</p>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git checkout main
</code></pre></div>      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Add a reference to the original GitHub repository</p>

        <p>If you have done step 2 before and try to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">remote add</code> again, git will tell you that a “remote upstream already exists”. In this case you can safely continue to step 4.</p>

<p>Because this was just a practice pull request, let’s close it again.</p>

					<b>Liked</b>: Liked the clean explanation with visuals. Great Job. In clears the process flow for beginners. 
					<b>Disliked</b>: 1) In situations where I'm working on a feature "F1" in branch "B1", while I prepare to make a PR, do I need to keep my local up-to date with Upstream before PR?  2) After deciding my feature branch is good to go for PR, can I checkout to Master and pull my feature first? What's the process for updating my Master with my new feature I developed?  Please answer this. I always have this confusion. Thanks.
