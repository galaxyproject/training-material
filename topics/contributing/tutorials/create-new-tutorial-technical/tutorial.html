<p>To be able to run the tutorial, we need a Galaxy instance where all of the needed tools and data are available. Thus we need to describe the needed technical infrastructure.</p>

<p>The files we define in this tutorial will be used to automatically build a Docker Galaxy flavour, and also to test if a public Galaxy instance is able to run the tool.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a virtualized Galaxy instance, based on Docker, to run your training - either on normal computers or cloud environments.</p>

<h1 id="extracting-workflows">Extracting workflows</h1>

<p>Once the tutorial is ready, we need to develop a workflow that represents the steps taken in the tutorial, and then extract these workflow(s) and add them to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">workflows</code> directory in the tutorial. Additionally we will need to add some explanation about the workflow(s) in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <div class="box-title hands-on-title" id="hands-on-extract-the-workflow"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Hands-on: Extract the workflow</div>

  <ol>
    <li>Add the topic name as a Tag and the tutorial title as Annotation/Notes to the workflow using the workflow editor.</li>
    <li>Download the workflow for the tutorial</li>
    <li>Save it in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">workflow</code> directory of the tutorial</li>
    <li>
      <p>Check that your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">workflow</code> directory has an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.md</code> with the contents:</p>

      <div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>

<h2 id="testing-the-workflow-recommended">Testing the workflow (recommended)</h2>

<p>Workflow testing is a great way to get feedback that your tutorial can be run successfully on a given server. When you’re giving a training this can provide peace of mind, not only are the tools installed (as is indicated by the badges we provide) but they also work.</p>

<p>Given the workflow you created above and have included in the tutorial folder, you’ll need to create a corresponding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-test.yml</code> file.</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <div class="box-title hands-on-title" id="hands-on-creating-the-test-yml-file-for-your-workflow"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Hands-on: Creating the `-test.yml` file for your workflow</div>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Find the correct name for the file; if your workflow was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unicycler.ga</code>, then your test file should be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unicycler-test.yml</code>, they need to share the same prefix.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Create the following structure:</p>

      <div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>

<p>You’ll need to edit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">job</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">outputs</code> sections according to your workflow’s inputs and outputs. Additionally you will need to edit the steps of your workflow <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ga</code> file appropriately.</p>

<h3 id="inputs">Inputs</h3>

<p>Your workflow <strong>must</strong> use “Data Inputs” for each input dataset. For each of these input steps in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ga</code> file, you’ll need to do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Edit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">label</code></li>
  <li>Edit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code></li>
  <li>Edit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputs[0].name</code></li>
  <li>Edit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tool_state</code></li>
</ol>

<p>In a normal workflow you have exported from Galaxy, you’ll see something like</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">

<p>You can test the file you’ve written with the following command and a recent version (&gt;=0.56.0) of planemo:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">planemo test \

<span class="go">	--no_shed_install \
	--engine external_galaxy \
	workflow.ga
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Planemo will autodetect that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">workflow-test.yml</code> file and load that for the testing.</p>

<h3 id="skipping-testing-in-the-gtn">Skipping Testing in the GTN</h3>

<p>If for some reason you want to skip this workflow being tested in the GTN,
please add a comment with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GTN_RUN_SKIP_REASON</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-test.yml</code> file stating
the reason it is skipped.</p>

<p>This will also exempt you from writing output tests.</p>

<p>A good use case for this is you want to provide a working test, but the workflow takes upwards of 6 hours to execute (e.g. large download jobs.)</p>

<p>The datasets needed for a tutorial can also be integrated in the Galaxy instance inside of data libraries. These allow the datasets to be easily shared with all users of a Galaxy instance. Additionally it lets trainees avoid each re-downloading the input data.</p>

<h1 id="creating-the-galaxy-interactive-tour-optional">Creating the Galaxy Interactive Tour (optional)</h1>

<p>A Galaxy Interactive Tour is a way to go through an entire analysis, step by step inside Galaxy in an interactive and explorative way.
It is a great way to help users run the tutorial directly inside Galaxy. To learn more about creating a Galaxy tour please have a look at our <a href="/training-material/topics/contributing/tutorials/create-new-tutorial-tours/tutorial.html">dedicated tour training</a>.</p>

<h1 id="testing-the-technical-infrastructure">Testing the technical infrastructure</h1>

<p>Once we have defined all the requirements for running the tutorial, we can test these requirements, either in a locally running Galaxy or in a Docker container. Please see our tutorial about <a href="/training-material/topics/teaching/tutorials/setup-galaxy-for-training/tutorial.html">Setting up Galaxy for Training</a> about how to test your tutorial requirements.</p>
