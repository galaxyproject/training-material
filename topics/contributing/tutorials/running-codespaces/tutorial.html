<p>Let’s have a closer look at your CodeSpaces window:</p>

  <li><strong>Left:</strong> Here you see all the files in the GTN repository</li>
  <li><strong>Top:</strong> This is the main window where you can view and edit files</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom:</strong> Terminal window. Here you can type commands (e.g. to build the website preview) and read output and error messages.</li>

        <li>The preview will show the GTN 404 (codespace doesnt know what to show)</li>

<p>Now that you have the codespace environment working and we have a live preview up, let’s make some changes to the GTN materials and get an instant preview.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You have spotted a typo in one of the tutorials, and would like to fix this and see the resulting GTN webpage.</p>

        <li>Topic: “Introduction to Galaxy Analyses” topic</li>
        <li>Tutorial: “A Short Introduction to Galaxy””</li>
        <li>We will edit this tutorial and watch the live preview window for the effects</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>On the file browser on the left, open the following file:</p>

<h1 id="saving-your-changes-back-to-github">Saving your changes back to GitHub</h1>

<p>When you have finished your changes, it all looks good in the preview, you want to save your changes back to GitHub so that you can either continue later, or make a Pull Request to the GTN to contribute your changes.</p>

  <p>First we commit our changes inside the codespace:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to the “Source Control” icon on the left menu bar (it should have a blue dot on it)</li>
    <li>You should see your changed file (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tutorial.md</code>)

<p>Everybody gets 60 hours per month for free on CodeSpaces. Your codespace will automatically shut down after 30 minutes of inactivity,
but it is always a good idea to close your CodeSpace when you are finished with it, to conserve your quotum.</p>
