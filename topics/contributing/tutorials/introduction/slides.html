???
Presenter notes contain extra information which might be useful if you intend to use these slides for teaching.

Press `P` again to switch presenter notes off

Press `C` to create a new window where the same presentation will be displayed.
This window is linked to the main window. Changing slides on one will cause the
slide to change on the other.

Useful when presenting.

### Welcome to the Galaxy Community

There are tons of ways to help out and become a Galaxy contributor - through support, training, presentations, events, code, tools, testing, and documentation.

???
Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Galaxy project, and making it easier to enable reproducible, accessible, and transparent data-intensive science for everyone!
---

### Some questions

- Are you an instructor, giving training/workshop?

--

- Are you using Galaxy for training?

--

- Do you know the resources of the Galaxy Training Network?

???
To make it easier to get started, we&apos;ll work you through some of the steps.
---
### Galaxy Training Material

.image-75[![Screenshot of the website](/training-material/topics/contributing/images/website_screenshot.png)]

https://training.galaxyproject.org

&lt;small&gt;
One website, aggregating training material covering many current research topics.
&lt;/small&gt;

---
### Interactive learning via hands-on tutorials built around a &quot;research story&quot;

![Screenshot with 2 web-browsers open side-by-side: one pointed at the current tutorial and the other at a Galaxy instance](/training-material/topics/contributing/images/interactive_hands_on.png)

&lt;small&gt;
Usable by individual users &amp; instructors
&lt;/small&gt;

---
### Developed and maintained by the community on GitHub

.image-75[![Screenshot of github repo](/training-material/topics/contributing/images/github_screenshot.png)]

https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material

---
### Repository structure

![Training Material structure](/training-material/topics/contributing/images/infrastructure.png)

---

### Some questions

- Have you already contributed to a project using GitHub?

--

- Have you already contributed to the Galaxy Training Material?

--

- Are you using Windows?

???
Don&apos;t worry if you&apos;re new to &quot;open source&quot;, or if you&apos;re still a student -- many of our contributors are, too, and we&apos;d be happy to provide mentorship and support if this is your first time contributing to an open-source project.

The main thing is that you are passionate about addressing common challenges in data-intensive science and that you&apos;re responsible and reliable.
