If you created your fork a long time ago, the default branch on your fork may still be called **master** instead of **main**

1. Point your browser to your fork of the GTN repository
   - The url will be `https://github.com/<your username>/training_material` (replacing <your username> with your GitHub username)

2. Check the default branch that is shown (at top left).

3. Does it say `main`?
   - Congrats, nothing to do, **you can skip the rest of these steps**

4. Does it say `master`? Then you need to update it, following the instructions below

5. Go to your fork's settings (Click on the gear icon called "Settings")
6. Find "Branches" on the left
7. If it says master you can click on the â‡†  icon to switch branches.
8. Select `main` (it may not be present).
9. If it isn't present, use the pencil icon to rename `master` to `main`.
