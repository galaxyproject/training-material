Whenever you want to contribute something new to the GTN, it is important to start with an up-to-date branch. To do this, you should always update the main branch of your fork, before creating a so-called *feature branch*, a branch where you make your changes.

1. Point your browser to your fork of the GTN repository
   - The url will be `https://github.com/<your username>/training_material` (replacing 'your username' with your GitHub username)

2. You might see a message like "This branch is 367 commits behind galaxyproject/training-material:main." as in the screenshot below.

3. Click the **Sync Fork** button on your fork to update it to the latest version.

4. **TIP:** never work directly on your main branch, since that will make the sync process more difficult. Always create a new branch before committing your changes.
