title: "Contributing to the Galaxy Training Material"
summary: "Galaxy is a great solution to train the bioinformatics concepts:
numerous bioinformatics tools are available (more than 7,000 in the ToolShed), it
can be used by people without any computer science skills, it trains to use
technology, outlining available resources and efforts that have made them
accessible to researchers, it is scalable.<br>
In 2016, the Galaxy Training Network decided to set up a new infrastructure for
delivering easily Galaxy related training material. The idea was to develop
something open and online based on a community effort, as always in Galaxy."

    description: |
      Over the years publications about the GTN and GTN communities have been published, and used GTN (meta)data to do it.
      These tutorials will show you how to leverage some of the data already
      contained within the GTN, but beware, they generally require programming
      skills!
