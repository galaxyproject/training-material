title: "Contributing to the Galaxy Training Material"
summary: "Galaxy is a great solution to train the bioinformatics concepts:
numerous bioinformatics tools are available (almost 5,000 in the ToolShed), it
can be used by people without amy computer science skills, it trains to use
technology, outlining available resources and efforts that have made them
accessible to researchers, it is scalable.<br>
In 2016, the Galaxy Training Network decide to set up a new infrastructure for
delivering easily Galaxy related training material. The idea was to develop
something open and online based on a community effort, as always in Galaxy."
