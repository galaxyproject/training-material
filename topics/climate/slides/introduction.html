# What do we mean by "Climate"?

*[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate)*: 
Climate is defined as the **average state** of everydayâ€™s weather condition **over a period of 30 years**.
It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in terms of temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time.

# Weather versus climate

*Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.*

![Weather versus Climate](../images/weather_versus_climate.png "Differences between weather and climate")

Watch [this Video](https://youtu.be/e0vj-0imOLw) to get an illustration of the difference between climate and weather.

???
There is often a confusion among the general public between the notions of "weather" and "climate". 
It is therefore important to clarify the differences (short-term vs. long-term, local/regional vs. global scales) and
also provide indications about what can be expected regarding weather (i.e., is it going to rain tomorrow in a particular region?) 
or climate (e.g., what is the global temperature trend, etc.).

# Types of climate data resources

- **Observations**: usually the most reliable, but there are little actual observations at the scale of climate and covering a large area;
- **Re-analyses**: these combine observations with numerical models to produce "best estimates" of climate variables; 
- **Climate models**: climate variables produced by numerical simulations only.

???
We briefly introduce in this slide the 3 different types of climate data resources available to scientists, and in the following slides we will explain 
what can be used depending on the time period of interest and application.

---

## What is available for the period of time you are interested in?

![Climate data types](../images/climate_data_types.png "Different climate data type and their main characteristics")

???
The first thing to consider when looking for climate data is time.
That can be past climate or present days (in which case information can be available from several sources), 
or future climate (for which only numerical climate models can be of any use, since there has not yet been any actual observation made
in the future or any re-analysis using these).

---

## Direct observations &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![Observations](../images/observation_type.png "Show observations are always in the past")

- Measurements (from ground stations, buoys, satellites, etc.) of one or more physical variables (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.) at one or more particular times and places. 

![WMO global observing system](../images/WMO_global_observing_system.png "The World Meteorological Organisation Global Observing System")

???
These direct observations correspond to the most common type of physical variables (temperature, wind, rainfall, etc.) 
which can be collected using measuring instruments.
Notice that this category also includes remotely sensed data (like satellite imagery or radar) although these can be subject to 
complex data processing before they can be of any use.

---

## Indirect observations &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![Observations](../images/observation_type.png "Show observations are always in the past")

They are derived from other observations, including:
- ice cores
- lake sediments
- tree rings

These indirect observations are sometimes referred to as "climate proxies".

![Tree rings](../images/frost_rings_375.jpg "Show two distorted rings from a Siberian pine")

*Source*: https://www.earth.columbia.edu

???
As opposed to the direct observations mentioned in the previous slide, 
"proxies" are somehow related to climate but in a rather intricate manner, and they can also be influenced by other factors.
For example the growth of trees depends on the amount of heat and nutrients/water available (although the exact relationship is not straightforward), 
but also for example on the location/exposition, on possible insects/animals attacks or diseases, which are even less predictable.

On this picture two rings from a Siberian pine in Mongolia are clearly distorted, 
and that was linked to a particularly cold winter after a volcanic eruption which 
caused a drastic cooling in the northern hemisphere that froze sap in the cells during the growing season (dated around 536 Common Era).

# Reanalysis &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![Re-analysis](../images/reanalysis_type.png "Show re-analysis data are always in the past")

- A climate re-analysis is produced by combining numerical models with observations so it can only provide information about the past climate. 
It contains estimates of the air temperature, wind at different altitudes, rainfall, soil moisture content, etc.
- The estimates are produced for all locations on Earth, and they span a long time period that can extend back decades or more.

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FAGobvUGl24" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

???
As opposed to observations which are not available for every location on the planet or at any given time, 
re-analyses "fill these gaps" by using complex numerical forecast models and data assimilation schemes.

It is a bit like re-making a weather forecast for last Monday,
then "re-adjusting" the model outputs knowing what the weather was actually like that particular day (based on observations),
and using the combined observation-model information to infer the weather for the following day (last Tuesday), and so on and so forth.

One could argue that there is not much point in "predicting" last week's weather, since it already happened and everybody knows about it now.

Although knowing what the weather was like last week or last year cannot be of any help to make any decision a posteriori, 
it is extremely relevant for those who try to understand past events, 
for scientists (to improve the models and for instance include features which were not adequately represented), for policy makers, etc.

Re-analysis provide continuous and consistent data, with a fine temporal and spatial resolution, 
and is generally the best choice when a high degree of confidence is expected.

# What is a model?

Numerical models are a mathematical representation of the climate developed by scientists to understand and predict the climate system. 

![Atmospheric Model Schematic](../images/AtmosphericModelSchematic.png "Illustrate the notion of numerical climate model")

*Source*: [https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/primer/climate-models](https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/primer/climate-models)

???
Climate models exploit numerical algorithms and high performance computers to solve mathematical equations that describe the physics of the 
atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, land surfaces and biosphere
to help scientists better understand how the Earth system "works" and how climate changes, or assess the impact of human activities and
events (like volcanic eruptions), but also quantify the effectiveness of mitigation measures, for example.

---

# Climate Models &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![Climate model type](../images/model_type.png "climate models cover both past and future")

Various types of models are used for different aspects of the climate. 
All have different ways to represent the real world, depending on how researchers prioritize and perform these simplifications (in terms of parameterizations, etc.) in the numerical climate model.

## How good are climate models?

Climate models are continuously improving but they still have biases and weaknesses, also some models perform "better" in the atmosphere, 
others in the hydrosphere, etc.
As a result, a single climate simulation cannot be considered as providing the "truth".
Usually a good overview can be obtained when considering several model "families" rather than any single model, or several model run in slightly 
different conditions (also called "ensemble runs").

???
The physics equations for each model component (atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, etc.) are solved for each grid cell and appropriate time steps.

Simplifications, called "parameterizations", are also made to include processes which are too complex to "put into equations" 
or would require too much computational resources to be explicitly resolved, or involve scales much smaller than the model grid.

# Climate prediction *vs.* projection

## Climate prediction

A **climate prediction** (or climate forecast) is an attempt to produce an estimate of the actual evolution of the natural climate in the future, for example, at seasonal, inter-annual or long-term time scales. 

## Climate projections

**Climate projections** are distinct from climate predictions in that projections depend upon emission/concentration/radiative forcing **scenarios**, which are based on assumptions concerning, for example, future socio-economic and technological developments that may or may not be realized and are therefore subject to substantial uncertainty.

Within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), now in its 6th phase, project simulations of the 
research community provide model output that will fuel climate research and climate impact studies for the 
next 5 to 10 years, while its careful analysis will form the basis for future climate assessments.

# Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) ![Climate model type](../images/climate_type_ssp.png "climate models cover both past and future")

**= societal development pathway**

The SSPs were developed as a joint community effort and describe global developments that
together would lead to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change.
SSPs comprise **five alternative** narratives that describe the main characteristics of the
pathways in qualitative terms as well as quantitative descriptions for key elements including
population, economic growth and urbanization.

Different pathways are defined by the magnitude of the challenges a future society
would face in adapting to or mitigating climate change if that socioeconomic pathway was pursued.

# Where to start to get climate data?

*There is a wealth of data and information available on the **web** about the past, current and future climate.*

**Not all of it is up-to-date and trustworthy**

- Check the provenance and data provider credentials

**Not all the variables/parameters are necessarily relevant for your study**

- Prioritize the use of [Essential Climate Variables](https://gcos.wmo.int/en/essential-climate-variables/about) (as we know they critically contribute to the characterization of Earthâ€™s climate).

**Not all the variables are reliable**

- For instance, temperature is usually reliable but precipitation is more difficult to estimate
- Prioritize observations and re-analyses for past climate

**Prefer authoritative data providers**
