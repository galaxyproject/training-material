# Introduction


Through this tutorial, you will learn in the first part how to import, visualise, and extract data from an ODV collection by using the ODV Galaxy interactive tool.
In the second part, you will learn how to use DIVAnd using the inputs the outputs from ODV.

Ocean Data View (ODV) is a software package for the interactive exploration, analysis and visualization of oceanographic and other geo-referenced profile, time-series, trajectory,
or sequence data. To know more about ODV go check the [official page](https://odv.awi.de/)

DIVAnd (Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis in n dimensions) performs an n-dimensional variational analysis/gridding of arbitrarily located observations.
Observations will be interpolated/analyzed on a curvilinear grid in 1, 2, 3 or more dimensions. See the [official page](https://gher-uliege.github.io/DIVAnd-presentation/#1)

> <details-title> Some complementary information about your data </details-title>
> The data here are Mediterranean Sea - Eutrophication and Acidity aggregated datasets
> EMODnet Chemistry aims to provide access to marine chemistry datasets and derived data products concerning eutrophication, acidity, and contaminants. The importance of the selected substances and other parameters relates to the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). This aggregated dataset contains all unrestricted EMODnet Chemistry data on eutrophication and acidity and covers the Mediterranean Sea. Data were aggregated and quality controlled by the 'Hellenic Centre for Marine Research, Hellenic National Oceanographic Data Centre (HCMR/HNODC)' in Greece. To get more ODV collection and other data please  [search the sextant catalogue](https://sextant.ifremer.fr/eng/Data/Catalogue#/search?isTemplate=n&from=1&to=30&sortBy=dateStamp&sortOrder=desc&languageStrategy=searchInDetectedLanguage&any=EMODnet%20Chemistry) or the [EMODnet Chemistry catalogue](https://emodnet-chemistry.webodv.awi.de/).
>
>  ITS-90 water temperature and water body salinity variables have also been included ('as are') to complete the eutrophication and acidity data. If you use these variables for calculations, please refer to SeaDataNet for the quality flags: https://www.seadatanet.org/Products/Aggregated-datasets.
>
> Regional datasets concerning eutrophication and acidity are automatically harvested, and the resulting collections are aggregated and quality-controlled using ODV Software and following a common methodology for all sea regions {% cite emodnet %}. Parameter names are based on P35 vocabulary, which relates to EMODnet Chemistry aggregated parameter names and is available at: https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/search_nvs/P35/.
>
> When not present in the original data, water body nitrate plus nitrite was calculated by summing all nitrate and nitrite parameters. The same procedure was applied for water body dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), which was calculated by summing all nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium parameters. Concentrations per unit mass were converted to a unit volume using a constant density of 1.025 kg/L. {% cite hcmrdata %}

# Workflow human in the loop

Now you've got your workflow running, however this workflow is composed of both interactive and non interactive tools. Thus, for the interactive tools we need you !

## Ocean Data view: Managing an interactive tool
ODV is now integrated in Galaxy as an interactive tool. This kind of tool works differently than classical tools as it allows the user to interact interactively with your data.
This kind of tool is used to give access to Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio or R Shiny apps for example.

To use ODV, you need to use the {% tool [dedicated form](interactive_tool_odv) %}, you can specify input datasets from your history you want to use in ODV,
then press the **execute** button to launch an ODV instance. When the graphical user interface of ODV is ready to be used, a URL will be displayed at the top of the
Galaxy center panel. If you don't see it, you can see and access it through the "Active InteractiveTools" space of the "User" menu or you can click on {% icon galaxy-eye %} on
the tool in the history.

Once you finish your work on ODV, if you want to retrieve data and/or the entire project, you need to save files in ODV/galaxy/outputs, then quit ODV properly through
the "Project" Menu tab.

To get in the interactive tool do the folowing

{% snippet faqs/galaxy/interactive_tools_open.md tool="ODV" %}

### Visualise your Data

> <tip-title>Copy pasting between computer and ODV</tip-title>
> You can expand the ODV left panel (where there are 3 dots, vertically) to access the "clipboard" menu and paste the content you want to paste on an ODV form. From there you can copy-paste everything from one side to the other. Then, click outside of this panel to collapse it.

## DIVAnd: Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis in n dimensions
You can see now in your Galaxy history that ODV turned green and that the folowing step launched itself.
This tool DIVAnd is not interactive. It will create a climatology in netcdf that will then be used as input in the next step which is ODV again.
Once, DIVAnd finished ODV get started and there we need you again !


## BONUS: Even more ODV

Do you want to go even further and visualise your new netcdf data? (Because this tutorial is fascinating and you want to keep reading ;))

       text="If you want the easiest tutorial possible choose New user. If you feel that you need more flexibility on the DIVAnd parameters choose Experimented user." %}

<div class="New-user" markdown="1">

You chose New user ! Thus, you'll be running a batch tool, you just have to fill in the input like explained below.

## Get the Bathymetry
First you need to download a bathymetry file you can use this link <https://dox.ulg.ac.be/index.php/s/U0pqyXhcQrXjEUX/download> with the folowing Hands-on box where you can name this dataset **bathymetry.nc**

{% snippet faqs/galaxy/datasets_import_via_link.md box_type="hands-on" %}

Check that the file is in netcdf !

>    - *"Write the name of the variable of the analysis"*: `phosphate`
>    - *"Minimum of the salinity"*: `0`
>    - *"Maximum of the salinity"*: `100`
>
> 2. **Run Tool**
> 3. After a couple minutes an `DIVAnd netcdf output` output will appear green in your history.
> 4. Check that your data are in netcdf format with {% icon galaxy-pencil %}, it should be `netcdf`

<div class="Experimented-user" markdown="1">

You chose Experimented user ! Thus, you'll be launching a Jupyterlab and you'll need to interact with it.

## Launch DIVAnd

Use ODV outputs as DIVAnd input.
> <hands-on-title>Run DIVANnd</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Use {% tool [DIVAnd](interactive_tool_divand) %} with the following parameters:
>    - *"Do you already have a notebook"*: `Start with a fresh notebook`
>    - *"Include data into the environment"*: `ODV netcdf outputs` (output of **Ocean Data View** {% icon tool %})
> 2. **Run tool**
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/interactive_tools_open.md tool="DIVAnd" %}
{: .hands_on}

> <hands-on-title>Navigate the jupyterlab</hands-on-title>
> 1. Once in the Jupyterlab, go to the **Notebooks** folder.
> 2. There open a terminal window and write :
>    ```bash
>    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fair-ease/Divand-Galaxy-ext/main/90-analysis-shorten.ipynb
>    ```
> 3. **Run the entire notebook.**
>
>    In the first 'outputs' folder (at the root of the Jupyterlab folders), you should now have one netcdf file "Water_body_Phosphate_Mediterranean".
>
>    So, you can now properly close the Jupyter notebook.
>
> 4. On the top left click on **files** and then on **Shut down**.
> 5. Go back to your Galaxy instance.
{: .hands-on}

After a couple of minutes, your outputs should appear in your Galaxy history.

# BONUS: Even more ODV

Do you want to go even further and visualise your new netcdf data? (Because this tutorial is fascinating and you want to keep reading ;))

> <hands-on-title>Open your Netcdf data in ODV</hands-on-title>
>  {% tool [Ocean Data View](interactive_tool_odv) %} with the following parameters:
>    - *"Select if you are using an ODV collection in a zip folder or if you have your own raw data"*: `The data you are using are Netcdf or text tabular files`
>    - *"Netcdf or tabular text file. For text file, odv format is recommanded."*: `DIVAnd netcdf outputs` (output of **DIVAnd** {% icon tool %})
>
> Click on **Run Tool**
>
> {% snippet faqs/galaxy/interactive_tools_open.md tool="ODV" %}
>
> 1. Click on close of the pop-up screen for the check for Updates
> 2. Go the top left and click on **File**, then on **Open...**
> 3. On the pop-up screen on the left panel select **ODV**, then the folder **galaxy**, then **data**.
> You should see a file open it (double clicking)
> 4. Click on **Open** in the bottom right. Then click on **Next** until you can click on **Finish** you can keep everything by default.
>
> There your data should be opening and you can now visualise them!

# Conclusion

Great you now know how to extract ocean variables from an ODV collection and use these extracted data in DIVAnd.
From there you can grid the phosphate variable on the subset extracted create a netcdf file and visualise it on ODV again.
We finished with the last results visible on the galaxy instance in the output **ODV all outputs** :
