The practical aims at familiarzing you with the [Panoply](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/) Galaxy interactive environment. Panoply is among the most popular tool to visualize geo-referenced data stored in [Network Common Data Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetCDF) (netCDF). It provides a graphical interface for inspecting (show metadata) and visualizing netCDF data. It supports many features to customize your plots and we will introduce some of them in this lesson.

In this tutorial, you will learn to:
- Plot geo-referenced latitude-longitude, latitude-vertical, longitude-vertical, time-latitude or time-vertical arrays.
- Use any of numerous color tables for the scale colorbar
- Save plots to GIF, JPEG, PNG or TIFF bitmap images or as PDF or PostScript graphics files.
- Export animations as MOV or AVI videos

> ### {% icon comment %} Background
>
>There are many online services to get climate data, and it is often difficult to know which ones are up-to date and which resources to trust.
> Different services provide different Application Programming Interfaces (API), use different terminologies, different file formats etc., which make it difficult for new users to master them all.
> Therefore in this tutorial, we will be focusing on the usage of Climate data in [Network Common data Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetCDF) (netCDF) because it is the most common data format for storing Climate data.
> We will be using a freely available dataset containing Essential Climate Variables (sea ice area fraction, surface temperature) from [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home). We will learn to use panoply to visualize the sea ice area fraction over the poles (southern and northern poles) and surface temperatures for two different years (1979 and 2018).

## NetCDF format

[NetCDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetCDF) data format is a binary format and to be able to read or visualize it, we would need to use dedicated software or libraries that can handle this "special" format. It is self-describing and machine-independent data format that supports the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data. NetCDF files usually have the extension *.nc* or *.netcdf*.

For climate and forecast data stored in NetCDF format there are (non-mandatory) conventions on metadata ([CF Convention](http://cfconventions.org/)).

In this tutorial, we will be using data from the [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://zenodo.org/record/3695482/files/era5-land.nc?download=1) and more precisely a [reanalysis ERA5-Land monthly averaged dataset](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land-monthly-means?tab=overview) for 2019. Data from Copernicus Climate Data Store is freely available but may require [free registration](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user/register?destination=%2Fcdsapp%23!%2Fdataset%2Freanalysis-era5-land-monthly-means%3Ftab%3Doverview) and license agreement.

## Get data

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Data upload
>
> 1. Create a new history for this tutorial. If you are not inspired, you can name it *Panoply* for example...
>    {% include snippets/create_new_history.md %}
> 2. Import the file from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3697454) or from the shared data library
>
>    ```
>    https://zenodo.org/record/3697454/files/ecv_1979.nc
>    https://zenodo.org/record/3697454/files/ecv_2018.nc
>    ```
>
>    {% include snippets/import_via_link.md %}
>    {% include snippets/import_from_data_library.md %}
>
> 3. Check that the datatype is **netcdf**
>
>    Files you uploaded are in netcdf format. In Galaxy, Datatypes are, by default, automatically guessed. Here, as necdf is a derivative of the h5 format, Galaxy automatically affect the h5 datatype to netcdf files. To cope with that, one can change the datatype manually, once datasets uploaded (as shown below) OR you can directly specify datatype on the upload tool form so Galaxy will not try to automatically guess it.
>
>    {% include snippets/change_datatype.md datatype="datatypes" %}
>
> 4. Rename Datasets
>
>    As "https://zenodo.org/record/3697454/files/ecv_1979.nc" is not a beautiful name and can give errors for some tools, it is a good practice to change the dataset name by something more meaningfull. For example by removing `https://zenodo.org/record/3697454/files/` to obtain `ecv_1979.nc` and `ecv_2018.nc`, respectively.
>
>    {% include snippets/rename_dataset.md %}
>
> 5. Add a tag to the dataset corresponding to `copernicus`

>    > ### {% icon question %} Question
>    >
>    > 1. What kind of colormap could you use to highlight the extent of sea-ice?
>    > 2. What projection would be best to use for showing the extent of sea-ice over the two poles?
>    >
>    > > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
>    > >
>    > > 1. Any colormap that shows low values (close to 0) in light color so we can focus on values that are close to 1. For instance, **CP_PuBu_08.cpt**.
>    > >    ![Panoply sea-ice colormap](../../images/panoply_sea-ice_colormap.png "Sea-ice colormap")
>    > > 2. Using *Orthographic* projection is best for showing the northern and southern poles. One advantage is that you can choose to center the plot over 90 degrees latitude. To have both the northern and southern poles at the same time, choose **Stereographic (Two hemispheres)**.

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

We have now learnt how to analyze climate data using Panoply. We only use one of the two datasets so we strongly encourage you to do the same exercises with the second dataset **ecv_2018.nc**. Please note that when comparing surface temperature or sea-ice area fraction from 1979 and 2018, you would not be able to conclude anything regarding climate change. For any climate studies, long term timeseries (between 20 to 30 years) are necessary to establish climate trends.
