                <p>Terrestrial ecosystem models have been widely used to study the impact of climate changes on vegetation and terrestrial biogeochemical cycles in climate modelling community. They are also more and more applied in ecological studies to help ecologists to better understand the processes. But the technical challenges are still too high for most of the ecologists to use them. This practical aims at familiarizing you (especially ecologists) with running a terrestrial ecosystem model (i.e., CLM-FATES) at site-level in Galaxy and analyzing the model results.
It will also teach you on how to create Galaxy workflow for your site-level CLM-FATES simulations to make your research fully reproducible. We hope this tutorial will promote the use of CLM-FATES and other terrestrial ecosystem models by a broader community.</p>

  <p>FATES is the “Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator”, which is a vegetation demographic model (<span class="citation"><a href="#Fisher2017">Fisher <i>et al.</i> 2017</a></span>).
FATES needs what we call a “Host Land Model” (HLM) to run and in this tutorial
we will be using the <a href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/clm/">Community Land Model</a>
of the <a href="https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM">Community Terrestrial Systems Model</a> (CLM-CTSM).
FATES was derived from the CLM Ecosystem Demography model (CLM(ED)), which was documented in
<span class="citation"><a href="#Fisher2015"><b>Taking off the training wheels: the properties of a dynamic vegetation model without climate envelopes, CLM4.5(ED)</b> 2015</a></span> and <span class="citation"><a href="#Koven2020">Koven <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>.
And this technical note was first published as an appendix to <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/396c/b9f172cb681421ed78325a2237bfb428eece.pdf">that paper</a>.
The <a href="https://fates-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">FATES documentation</a> will provide some more insight on FATES too.</p>

<h1 id="get-clm-fates-input-data">Get CLM-FATES input data</h1>

<p>Preparing CLM-FATES input data is out of scope for this tutorial. We assume the input data tarball contains the following folders:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>atm   cpl   lnd   share
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each sub-folder will then contain all the necessary inputs for running your CLM-FATES case. For instance, ‘atm’ contains all the meteorological forcing data for running CLM-FATES. ‘lnd’ contains the data required to describe surface conditions (e.g., soil depth) for the model. More details about the model inputdata can be found in <a href="https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/versions/master/html/tech_note/Ecosystem/CLM50_Tech_Note_Ecosystem.html#model-input-requirements">CLM and FATES documentation</a>.
For the purpose of this tutorial, input data for a single point location (ALP1) on the Norwegian alpine tundra ecosystem (Latitude: 61.0243N, Longitude: 8.12343E, Elevation: 1208 m) has been prepared and is ready to use. This is a site included in the modelling platform developed under [EMERALD project] (https://www.mn.uio.no/geo/english/research/projects/emerald/). More details about the sites can be found in <span class="citation"><a href="#Klanderud2015">Klanderud <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span> and  <span class="citation"><a href="#Vandvik2020">Vandvik <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span></p>

  <p>Different Galaxy servers may have tools available under different sections, therefore it is often useful to use the <strong>search bar</strong> at the top of the tool panel to find your tool.</p>

  <p>Additionally different servers may have multiple, similarly named tools which accomplish similar functions. When following tutorials, you should use precisely the tools that they describe. For real analyses, however, you will need to search among the various options to find the one that works for you.</p>

  <p>When selecting a tool, Galaxy will pre-fill the tool parameters, selecting the first dataset with the corresponding type in your history.
Be aware that very often, the default pre-selection is incorrect and do not correspond to the required dataset.
So always check and update accordingly the tool parameters!</p>

        <p>When using <strong>startup</strong>, the FATES model will start from some arbitrary baseline state that is not linked to any previous run.
Startup runs are typically initialized using a start date of 0001-01-01 except if you change it (start date option).
For any scientific study, starting from an arbitraty baseline state implies you would need to run the model for a long period (between 100 and 200 years)
before being able to use the model outputs. For this reason, we usually make a first simulation (spin-up) in <strong>startup</strong> mode and reuse this case as a baseline
for our scientific study. We then use <strong>hybrid</strong> type and give additional inputs (restart files) to our simulation case. It is then important to specify the dates
of your restart files. This is what we do in this tutorial.</p>

        <p>All the history files contain gridded data values written at specified times during the model run.
Depending on the length of your simulation, you may have one or more history files that you can recognize from their names:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ALP1_exp.clm2.h0.yyyy-mm-dd-sssss.nc</code> (for non-monthly history files).
Datatypes are, by default, automatically guessed. Here, as the prefix is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.nc</code>, the format is not always recognized as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">netcdf</code> files.
To cope with that, one can change the datatype manually, as shown below.</p>

      <p>Our FATES model has run for 5 years only, so we get a single output file. As previously, we recommend
to rename all netCDF files so that they do not contain any special characters or dots (except for the file extension) or slashes. Some tools, in
particular Panoply, won’t be able to recognize your file if not named properly.</p>

<h1 id="share-your-work">Share your work</h1>

<p>One of the most important features of Galaxy comes at the end of an analysis. When you have published striking findings, it is important that other researchers are able to reproduce your in-silico experiment. Galaxy enables users to easily share their workflows and histories with others.</p>
