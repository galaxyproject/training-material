> ### {% icon comment %} Background
>
> [European Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)](https://climate.copernicus.eu/) provide authoritative information about the past, present
> and future climate. C3S is one of the many services provided by Copernicus, the European Union's Earth Observation Programme, looking
> at our planet and its environment for the ultimate benefit of all European citizens.
> The C3S [Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home) provides a single point of access to a wide range of 
> quality-assured climate datasets distributed in the cloud.
> Access to the CDS data is open, free and unrestricted.
> We will be using freely available datasets from the CDS, including 
> observations, historical climate data records, estimates of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) derived from Earth observations, 
> global and regional climate reanalyses of past observations, seasonal forecasts and climate projections. 
{:  .comment}

For the purpose of this tutorial, sample datasets have been created from data downloaded from [C3S](https://climate.copernicus.eu/) through
[Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home):
- [E-OBS daily gridded meteorological data for Europe from 1950 to present derived from in-situ observations](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/insitu-gridded-observations-europe?tab=overview)
- [Essential climate variables for assessment of climate variability from 1979 to present](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/ecv-for-climate-change?tab=overview)

To reduce the volume of data, the data resolution (in space and/or time) has been significantly reduced and/or data has been selected on sample locations (Paris, Oslo and 
Freiburg). The data format may also have been changed (for instance to tabular) to ease processing. 

## Get data

>    For example by removing `https://zenodo.org/record/3776500/files/` to obtain `tg_ens_mean_0.1deg_reg_v20.0e_Paris_daily.csv` and `ts_cities.csv`, respectively.

# What is climate?

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate), 
Climate is defined as the average state of everyday's weather condition **over a period of 30 years**. It is measured by assessing
the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and
other meteorological variables in a given region over a long period of time (usually 20 or 30 years).
Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region. 


## Climate versus Weather

Quantities that climate scientists are interested in are similar to those used to assess the weather (temperature, precipitation, etc.). 
But there is a big difference between climate and weather: **weather** varies from hour to hour and from day to day whereas **climate** 
is defined as the average of weather over several decades or longer.

The figure below shows a woman walking her dog and we can use it to make an analogy to illustrate the difference between weather and climate. 
if you focus your attention on the dog, you can see that it is all over the place, sometimes upwards, sometimes downwards: this can represent the weather and its 
variability. The dog (weather) is not following a fully random pattern and varies around a main direction (trend) that is given by the woman: the woman is representing
the climate and gives us an indication of where both the woman and dog are likely to be in the future.

# What is the climate in Paris?

To get some information about the (past and current) climate in Paris, we will first look at monthly averages.

## Seasonality

## Anomalies

In climate change studies, temperature **anomalies** are more important than **absolute** temperature. A temperature anomaly is the difference from an average, or baseline,
temperature. The baseline temperature is typically computed by averaging 30 or more years of temperature data. A *positive anomaly* indicates the observed temperature was *warmer* than the baseline, while a *negative anomaly* indicates the observed temperature was *cooler* than the baseline. 

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Climate stripes for Paris
>    Computing temperature anomalies is out of scope of this tutorial and we will therefore use pre-computed temperature anomalies `ts_cities.csv`.

# Climate variables

*Temperature* is often the first variable that comes to mind when we talk about climate. However, it is insufficient to fully characterize the climate, and scientists have agreed on a number of variables to systematically observe Earth`s changing climate. 

That is what we call *Essential Climate Variables*.

## Essential Climate Variables

The [Global Climate Observing System](https://gcos.wmo.int/) (GCOS) and its GCOS expert panels maintain definitions of [Essential Climate Variables](https://gcos.wmo.int/en/essential-climate-variables) (ECVs). 

GCOS is co-sponsored by the [World Meteorological Organization](https://public.wmo.int/en) (WMO), the [Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization](http://www.ioc-unesco.org/) (IOC-UNESCO), the [United Nations Environment Programme](https://www.unenvironment.org/) (UN Environment), and the [International Science Council](https://council.science/) (ISC). It regularly assesses the status of global climate observations of the atmosphere, land and ocean and produces guidance for its improvement.

At the moment, there are [54 ECVs](https://gcos.wmo.int/en/essential-climate-variables).

> *The humidity of air near the surface of the Earth affects the comfort and health of humans, livestock and wildlife, the swarming behaviour of insects and the occurrence of plant disease. The humidity of air near the surface affects evaporation and the strength of the hydrological and energy cycles. Evaporation from the surface of the earth is the source of water in the atmosphere and so is responsible for important feedbacks in the climate system due to clouds and radiation.*

>    > > 2. We do not have sufficient information to draw any conclusions about the change in climate. In our analysis, we only used two different months (July 1980 and July 2018) and can only discuss the average changes in weather during these two periods (July 1980 and July 2018). We learnt that to draw any conclusions on the climate, we would need to make statistics over a long period of time e.g. we would need to download about 30 years of data and for instance compute anomalies in relative humidity to check if there is any trend. These aspects will be discussed further in other Galaxy tutorials.

## Past, present and future climate?


When we talk about climate data, the type of data can vary significantly. We have very little actual observations at the scale of climate and usually not covering a large area. In addition to observations, we can make use of:
- Re-analyses where observations and numerical modelling are combined together. 
- Climate models.

Observations and re-analyses provide information about the past and current climate while climate models can provide past, current and future climate information.
When it comes to future climate, we usually need to make some assumptions (such as how much CO2 emissions, etc.) and simulate different scenarios e.g. we run climate models using different assumptions and look at future trends under each of these scenarios: this is what we call **climate projections**. Climate projections will be discussed in a separate Galaxy tutorial.


# Conclusion

{:.no_toc}

We have learnt to differentiate climate from weather and got an overview of the terminology used by climate scientists to identify the
