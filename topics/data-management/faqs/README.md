# FAQs

Formerly known as snippets, FAQs provide answers to short, commonly asked questions. These can then be included inside tutorials where appropriate, and easily updated when needed. We also use them to create FAQ pages listing all FAQs on a given subject.


To read more about how to use these snippets, or how to create new ones, please see the [contributing tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/topics/contributing/tutorials/create-new-tutorial-content/tutorial.html#faqs-snippets}
