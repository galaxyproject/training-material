The investigation of environmental microbial communities and microbiomes has been revolutionized by the 
development of high-throughput amplicon sequencing. In amplicon sequencing a particular genetic locus, 
for example the 16S rRNA gene (or a part of it) in bacteria, is amplified from DNA extracted from the community of interest, 
and then sequenced on a next-generation sequencing platform. This technique removes the need to culture 
microbes in order to detect their presence, and cost-effectively provides a deep census of a microbial community.

To process 16S amplicon sequencing data, several tools exist: **QIIME2** ({% cite Bolyen_2019 %}), **Mothur** ({% cite Schloss_2009 %}), **Lotus2** ({% cite _zkurt_2022 %}), and **DADA2** ({% cite Callahan_2016 %}). All these tools can be used in Galaxy. In this tutorial we will use **DADA2**.

The output of the dada2 pipeline is a feature table of amplicon sequence variants (an ASV table): A matrix with columns corresponding to samples and rows to ASVs, in which the value of each entry is the number of times that ASV was observed in that sample. This table is analogous to the traditional OTU table, except that one gets the actual sequences of the "true" sequence variants instead of rather anonymous and abstract entities called OTU1, OTU2, etc. 

The process of amplicon sequencing introduces errors into the sequencing data, and these errors 
severely complicate the interpretation of the results. **DADA2** implements a novel algorithm that models the errors introduced during amplicon sequencing, and uses that error model to infer the true sample composition. 

**DADA2** replaces the traditional "OTU-picking" step in amplicon sequencing workflows, producing instead higher-resolution tables of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs).

{% include topics/microbiome/tutorials/mothur-miseq-sop/background_otus.md %}

As seen in the paper introducing DADA2 ({% cite Callahan_2016 %}) and in [further benchmarking](http://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/SotA.html), the **DADA2** method is more sensitive and specific than traditional OTU methods: DADA2 detects real biological variation missed by OTU methods while outputting fewer spurious sequences.

To illustrate the 16S amplicon data processing using **DADA2**, we will use dataset generated by the Schloss lab in their
[their mothur MiSeq SOP](https://www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP): FASTQ files generated by 2x250 Illumina Miseq amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene from gut samples collected longitudinally from a mouse post-weaning. They [describe the experiment](https://www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP#Logistics) as follows:

> *The Schloss lab is interested in understanding the effect of normal variation in the gut microbiome on host health. To that end,
> we collected fresh feces from mice on a daily basis for 365 days post weaning. During the first 150 days post weaning (dpw),
> nothing was done to our mice except allow them to eat, get fat, and be merry. We were curious whether the rapid change in
> weight observed during the first 10 dpw affected the stability microbiome compared to the microbiome observed between days
> 140 and 150.*

To speed up analysis for this tutorial, we will use only a subset of this data. We will look at a single mouse at 20 different time points (10 early, 10 late).

# Prepare Galaxy and data

Any analysis should get its own Galaxy history. So let's start by creating a new one:

{: .hands_on}

The starting point for the **DADA2** pipeline is a set of demultiplexed FASTQ files corresponding to the samples in your amplicon sequencing study. That is, **DADA2** expects there to be an individual FASTQ file for each sample (or two FASTQ files, one forward and one reverse, for each sample). Demultiplexing is often performed at the sequencing center, but if that has not been done there are a variety of tools do accomplish this.

In addition, **DADA2** expects that there are no non-biological bases in the sequencing data. This may require pre-processing with outside software if, as is relatively common, your PCR primers were included in the sequenced amplicon region.

For this tutorial, we have 20 pairs of files. For example, the following pair of files:

- `F3D0_S188_L001_R1_001.fastq`
- `F3D0_S188_L001_R2_001.fastq`

The first part of the file name indicates the sample: `F3D0` here signifies that this sample was obtained from Female 3 on Day 0.

The rest of the file name is identical, except for `_R1` and `_R2`, this is used to indicate the forward and reverse reads respectively.

40 files are a lot of files to manage. Luckily Galaxy can make life a bit easier by allowing us to create **dataset collections**. This enables us to easily run tools on multiple datasets at once.

Since we have **paired-end** data, each sample consist of two separate FASTQ files:
- one containing the forward reads, and 
- one containing the reverse reads.

We can recognize the pairing from the file names, which will differ only by `_R1` or `_R2` in the filename. We can tell Galaxy about this paired naming convention, so that our tools will know which files belong together. We do this by building a **List of Dataset Pairs**

We can now start processing the reads using **DADA2**.

# Processing data using DADA2

Once demultiplexed FASTQ files without non-biological nucleotides are in hand, the **DADA2** pipeline proceeds as follows:

1. Prepare reads
   1. Inspect read quality profiles
   2. Filter and trim
   3. Learn the Error Rates
   4. Infer sample composition
   5. Merge forward/reverse reads

3. Construct sequence table
   1. Make sequence table
   2. Remove chimeras

The workflow generates several outputs that we will inspect them given the step they correspond to.

# Prepare reads

The first step is to check and improve the quality of data.

## Inspect read quality profiles

We start by visualizing the quality profiles of the forward reads:

<div class="Step-by-step" markdown="1">

> <hands-on-title>Inspect read quality profiles</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [dada2: plotQualityProfile](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/dada2_plotqualityprofile/dada2_plotQualityProfile/1.28+galaxy0) %} with the following parameters:

</div>

**dada2: plotQualityProfile** generates 2 files with quality profiles per sample: 1 PDF for forward reads and 1 PDF for reverse reads.

The mean quality score at each position is shown by the green line, and the quartiles of the quality score distribution by the orange lines. The red line shows the scaled proportion of reads that extend to at least that position (this is more useful for other sequencing technologies, as Illumina reads are typically all the same length, hence the flat red line).

> Your reads must still overlap after truncation in order to merge them later! The tutorial is using 2x250 V4 (expected size, 270 bp–387 bp) sequence data, so the forward and reverse reads almost completely overlap and our trimming can be completely guided by the quality scores. If you are using a less-overlapping primer set, like V1-V2 or V3-V4, your truncated length must be large enough to maintain $$ 20 + biological.length.variation $$ nucleotides of overlap between them.

## Filter and trim

<div class="Step-by-step" markdown="1">

>  The standard filtering parameters are starting points, not set in stone. If you want to speed up downstream computation, consider tightening the *"Remove reads by number expected errors"* value. If too few reads are passing the filter, consider relaxing the value, perhaps especially on the reverse reads (e.g. *"Remove reads by number expected errors"* to `2` for forward and `5` for reverse), and reducing the *"Truncate read length"* to remove low quality tails. Remember though, when choosing *"Truncate read length"* for paired-end reads you must maintain overlap after truncation in order to merge them later.

## Learn the Error Rates

The DADA2 algorithm makes use of a parametric error model (`err`) and every amplicon dataset has a different set of error rates. The **dada2: learnErrors** method learns this error model from the data, by alternating estimation of the error rates and inference of sample composition until they converge on a jointly consistent solution. As in many machine-learning problems, the algorithm must begin with an initial guess, for which the maximum possible error rates in this data are used (the error rates if only the most abundant sequence is correct and all the rest are errors).

<div class="Step-by-step" markdown="1">

**dada2: learnErrors** tool expects as input one collection and not a paired collection. We then need to split to paired collection into 2 collections: one with forward reads and one with reverse reads.

> <hands-on-title> Unzip paired collection </hands-on-title>

## Merge paired reads

We now merge the forward and reverse reads together to obtain the full denoised sequences. Merging is performed by aligning the denoised forward reads with the reverse-complement of the corresponding denoised reverse reads, and then constructing the merged "contig" sequences. By default, merged sequences are only output if the forward and reverse reads overlap by at least 12 bases, and are identical to each other in the overlap region (but these conditions can be changed via tool parameters).

# Make sequence table

In this step, we construct an amplicon sequence variant table (ASV) table, a higher-resolution version of the OTU table produced by traditional methods.

## Remove chimeras

The core DADA method corrects substitution and indel errors, but chimeras remain. Fortunately, the accuracy of sequence variants after denoising makes identifying chimeric ASVs simpler than when dealing with fuzzy OTUs. Chimeric sequences are identified if they can be exactly reconstructed by combining a left-segment and a right-segment from two more abundant "parent" sequences.

{: .question}

The frequency of chimeric sequences varies substantially from dataset to dataset, and depends on on factors including experimental procedures and sample complexity. Here chimeras make up about 21% of the merged sequence variants, but when we account for the abundances of those variants we see they account for only about 4% of the merged sequence reads.

> <comment-title>Sequences too long or too short</comment-title>
> 
> Most of the **reads** should remain after chimera removal (it is not uncommon for a majority of **sequence variants** to be removed though). If most of the reads were removed as chimeric, upstream processing may need to be revisited. In almost all cases this is caused by primer sequences with ambiguous nucleotides that were not removed prior to beginning the DADA2 pipeline.

> This is a great place to do a last sanity check. Outside of filtering, there should no step in which a majority of reads are lost. If a majority of reads failed to merge, you may need to revisit the truncLen parameter used in the filtering step and make sure that the truncated reads span your amplicon. If a majority of reads were removed as chimeric, you may need to revisit the removal of primers, as the ambiguous nucleotides in unremoved primers interfere with chimera identification.

# Assign taxonomy

It is common at this point, especially in 16S/18S/ITS amplicon sequencing, to assign taxonomy to the sequence variants. The DADA2 package provides a native implementation of the naive Bayesian classifier method ({% cite Wang_2007 %}) for this purpose. The **dada2: assignTaxonomy** function takes as input a set of sequences to be classified and a training set of reference sequences with known taxonomy, and outputs taxonomic assignments with at least `minBoot` bootstrap confidence.

DADA2 maintains [formatted training fastas for the RDP training set, GreenGenes clustered at 97% identity, and the Silva reference database](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/training.html), and additional trainings fastas suitable for protists and certain specific environments have been contributed. For fungal taxonomy, the General Fasta release files from the [UNITE ITS database](https://unite.ut.ee/repository.php) can be used as is.

# Exploration of ASVs with phyloseq

**phyloseq** ({% cite McMurdie_2013 %}) is a powerful framework for further analysis of microbiome data. It imports, stores, analyzes, and graphically displays complex phylogenetic sequencing data that has already been clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) or ASV, especially when there is associated sample data, phylogenetic tree, and/or taxonomic assignment of the OTUs/ASVs. 

## Prepare metadata table and launch phyloseq

To use phyloseq properly, the best is to provide it a metadata table. Here, we will also uses the small amount of metadata we have: the samples are named by the gender (G), mouse subject number (X) and the day post-weaning (Y) it was sampled (eg. GXDY).

We will construct a simple sample table from the information encoded in the filenames. Usually this step would instead involve reading the sample data in from a file. Here we will:

1. Extract element identifiers of a collection
2. Add information about gender, mouse subject number and the day post-weaning using the extracted element identifiers
4. Remove last line
5. Add extra column `When` to indicate if `Early` (days < 100) or `Late` (day > 100)
3. Add a header

## Visualize alpha-diversity

A **diversity index** is a quantitative measure that is used to assess the level of diversity or variety within a particular system, such as a biological community, a population, or a workplace. It provides a way to capture and quantify the distribution of different types or categories within a system.

Related to ecology, the term **diversity** describes the number of different species present in one particular area and their relative abundance. More specifically, several different metrics of diversity can be calculated. The most common ones are α, β and γ diversity.

The **α diversity** describes the diversity within a community. It considers the number of different species in an environment (also referred to as species **richness**). Additionally, it can take the abundance of each species into account to measure how evenly individuals are distributed across the sample (also referred to as species **evenness**).

There are several different indices used to calculate α diversity because different indexes capture different aspects of diversity and have varying sensitivities to different factors. These indexes have been developed to address specific research questions, account for different ecological or population characteristics, or highlight certain aspects of diversity.

Here we will plot the **α diversity** for the samples given the Days using 2 measures:

- The **Shannons** index, which calculates the uncertainty in predicting the species identity of an individual that is selected from a community ({% cite Shannon.1948 %}).

- The **Simpsons** index, which calculates the probability that two individuals selected from a community will be of the same species. Obtains small values in datasets of high diversity and large values in datasets of low diversity ({% cite SIMPSON.1949 %}).

## Plot Ordination

Ordination refers to a set of multivariate techniques used to analyze complex ecological data. It involves summarizing large datasets, such as species abundance across different samples, by projecting them onto a low-dimensional space. This visualization makes it easier to identify patterns and relationships within the data, such as how species distributions correspond to environmental gradients. Ordination helps understand the underlying factors that structure ecological communities and the relative importance of different environmental variables.

Phyloseq offers several ordination methods:

1. **MDS (Multidimensional Scaling)**: MDS is a technique that visualizes the level of similarity or dissimilarity of individual cases of a dataset by positioning them in a low-dimensional space.

2. **PCoA (Principal Coordinates Analysis)**: PCoA is a distance-based ordination method that transforms a distance matrix into a set of coordinates, allowing the visualization of the relationships between samples in a reduced dimensional space.

3. **DCA (Detrended Correspondence Analysis)**: DCA is an ordination method that removes the arch effect in Correspondence Analysis, providing a more accurate representation of ecological gradients.

2. **CCA (Canonical Correspondence Analysis)**: CCA is a direct gradient analysis technique that relates species composition data to measured environmental variables, highlighting the influence of these variables on community structure.

3. **RDA (Redundancy Analysis)**: RDA is a linear ordination method that combines features of regression and PCA, allowing the analysis of relationships between multiple response variables (e.g., species data) and explanatory variables (e.g., environmental data).

4. **DPCoA (Double Principle Coordinate Analysis)**: DPCoA is a multivariate technique that combines distance-based methods with correspondence analysis to account for phylogenetic or functional diversity among species.

5. **NMDS (Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling)**: NMDS is an ordination technique that aims to represent the pairwise dissimilarities between samples in a low-dimensional space, emphasizing the rank order of dissimilarities rather than their exact values.

Here we will plot **NMDS**.

## Plot abundance stacked barplot

Abundance barplots are graphical tools that display the relative abundance of different species or groups in a dataset, allowing for easy comparison and visualization of community composition and distribution patterns across samples.

Let's plot an abundance stacked barplot at the family level.

> 1. Click on **Bar** tab
> 2. Select the following parameters:
>    - *"X-axis"*: `Samples`
>    - *"Color"*: `Family`
>    - *"Facet Col"*: `When`
> 3. Click on **(Re)Build Graphic**
{: .hands_on}

The barplot is hard to read here: many families are in white because the color palette is reduced and we can not distinguish them. We need to filter to data to display only the most abundant families. We will select only taxa with more than 500 counts.

> ampvis2 ({% cite Andersen_2018 %}) team suggests [not using stacked bar charts but heatmaps to represent community diversity](http://albertsenlab.org/ampvis2-heatmap/). You can do that in Galaxy as ampvis2 is available as a tool.
