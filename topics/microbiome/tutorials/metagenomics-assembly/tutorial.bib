The most critical step of the metagenomic data analysis is the reconstruction of individual genes and genomes of the microorganisms in the communities using metagenomic assemblers – computational programs that put together small fragments of sequenced DNA generated by sequencing instruments. Here, we describe the challenges of metagenomic assembly, a wide spectrum of applications in which metagenomic assemblies were used to better understand the ecology and evolution of microbial ecosystems, and present one of the most efficient microbial assemblers, SPAdes that was upgraded to become applicable for metagenomics.},

Particularly, in microbiology, where budgets per sample are often scarce, it can make the difference between an inconclusive result and a fully valid conclusion. Identifying new strains or estimating the relative abundance of quasi-species in a sample are some example tasks that can’t be properly accomplished without previously generating assemblies with little structure ambiguity and covering most of the genome. In this work, we present a new genome assembly tool based on a greedy strategy. We compare the results obtained applying this tool to the results obtained with previously existing software. We find that, when applied to viral studies, comparatively, the software we developed often gets far larger contigs and higher genome fraction coverage than previous software. We also find a significant advantage when applied to exceptionally large virus genomes.},

	abstract = {One of the key open problems in large-scale DNA sequence assembly is the correct reconstruction of sequences that contain repeats. A long repeat can confound a sequence assembler into falsely overlaying fragments that sample its copies, effectively compressing out the repeat in the reconstructed sequence. We call the task of correcting this compression by separating the overlaid fragments into the distinct copies they sample, the repeat separation problem. We present a rigorous formulation of repeat separation in the general setting without prior knowledge of consensus sequences of repeats or their number of copies. Our formulation decomposes the task into a series of four subproblems, and we design probabilistic tests or combinatorial algorithms that solve each subproblem. The core subproblem separates repeats using the so-called k-median problem in combinatorial optimization, which we solve using integer linear-programming. Experiments with an implementation show we can separate fragments that are overlaid at 10 times the coverage with very few mistakes in a few seconds of computation, even when the sequencing error rate and the error rate between copies are identical. To our knowledge this is the first rigorous and fully general approach to separating repeats that directly addresses the problem.},

In this article, we present MetaQUAST, a modification of QUAST, the state-of-the-art tool for genome assembly evaluation based on alignment of contigs to a reference. MetaQUAST addresses such metagenome datasets features as (i) unknown species content by detecting and downloading reference sequences, (ii) huge diversity by giving comprehensive reports for multiple genomes and (iii) presence of highly relative species by detecting chimeric contigs. We demonstrate MetaQUAST performance by comparing several leading assemblers on one simulated and two real datasets.

A number of methods for comparing assemblers have been developed, but none is yet a recognized benchmark. Further, most existing methods for comparing assemblies are only applicable to new assemblies of finished genomes; the problem of evaluating assemblies of previously unsequenced species has not been adequately considered. Here, we present QUAST-a quality assessment tool for evaluating and comparing genome assemblies. This tool improves on leading assembly comparison software with new ideas and quality metrics. QUAST can evaluate assemblies both with a reference genome, as well as without a reference. QUAST produces many reports, summary tables and plots to help scientists in their research and in their publications. In this study, we used QUAST to compare several genome assemblers on three datasets. QUAST tables and plots for all of them are available in the Supplementary Material, and interactive versions of these reports are on the QUAST website.

The instructions use simulated mouse gut metagenome data released in preparation for the second round of CAMI challenges and showcase the use of a repository of tool results for CAMI datasets.

Related strains still were challenging for assembly and genome recovery through binning, as was assembly quality for the latter. Profilers markedly matured, with taxon profilers and binners excelling at higher bacterial ranks, but underperforming for viruses and Archaea.

Here, we reflect on another issue, i.e., how to handle highly similar MAGs assembled from independent data sets. Obtaining multiple genomic representatives for a species is highly valuable, as it allows for population genomic analyses; however, when retaining genomes of closely related populations, it complicates MAG quality assessment and abundance inferences. We show that (i) published data sets contain a large fraction of MAGs sharing {\textgreater}99\% average nucleotide identity, (ii) different software packages and parameters used to resolve this redundancy remove very different numbers of MAGs, and (iii) the removal of closely related genomes leads to losses of population-specific auxiliary genes.
