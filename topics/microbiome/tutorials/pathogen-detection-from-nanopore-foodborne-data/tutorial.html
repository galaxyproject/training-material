  "abstract": "Food contamination with pathogens is a major burden on our society. In the year 2019, foodborne pathogens caused 137 hospitalisations in Germany [(BVL 2019)](https://www.bvl.bund.de/SharedDocs/Berichte/10_BELA_lebensmittelbed_Krankheitsausbruechen_Dtl/Jahresbericht2019.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4). Globally, they affect an estimated 600 million people a year and impact socioeconomic development at different levels. These outbreaks are mainly due to _Salmonella spp._ followed by _Campylobacter spp._ and Noroviruses, as studied by the [__Food safety - World Health Organization (WHO)__](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241565165)."

                <p>Food contamination with pathogens is a major burden on our society. In the year 2019, foodborne pathogens caused 137 hospitalisations in Germany <a href="https://www.bvl.bund.de/SharedDocs/Berichte/10_BELA_lebensmittelbed_Krankheitsausbruechen_Dtl/Jahresbericht2019.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=4">(BVL 2019)</a>. Globally, they affect an estimated 600 million people a year and impact socioeconomic development at different levels. These outbreaks are mainly due to <em>Salmonella spp.</em> followed by <em>Campylobacter spp.</em> and Noroviruses, as studied by the <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241565165"><strong>Food safety - World Health Organization (WHO)</strong></a>.</p>

<p>During the investigation of a foodborne outbreak, a microbiological analysis of the potentially responsible food vehicle is performed in order to detect the responsible pathogens and identify the contamination source. By default, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:338:0001:0026:EN:PDF"><strong>European Regulation (EC)</strong></a> follows ISO standards to detect bacterial pathogens in food: pathogens are detected and identified by <strong>stepwise cultures</strong> on selective media and/or <strong>targeting specific genes with real-time PCRs</strong>. The current gold standard is Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) or Multiple-Locus Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA) to characterize the detected strains. These techniques have some disadvantages.</p>

<p><strong>Whole Genome Sequencing</strong> (WGS) has been proposed as an alternative. With just one sequencing run, we can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>detect all genes</li>
  <li>run phylogenetic analysis to link cases</li>
  <li>get information on antimicrobial resistance genes, virulence, serotype, resistance to sanitizers, root cause, and other critical factors in one assay, including historical reference to pathogen emergence.</li>
</ul>

<p>WGS is more than a surveillance tool and was recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for surveillance and outbreak investigation. WGS still requires isolation of the targeted pathogen, which is a time-consuming process, the execution is not always straightforward, nor the success is guaranteed. <strong>Sequencing methods without prior isolation could solve this issue</strong>.</p>

<p>The evolution of sequencing techniques in the last decades has made the development of shotgun metagenomic sequencing possible, <em>i.e.</em> the <strong>direct sequencing of all DNA present in a sample</strong>. This approach gives an overview of the genomic composition of all cells in the sample, including the food source itself, the microbial community, and any possible pathogens and their complete genetic information without the need for prior isolation. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of shotgun metagenomics to identify and characterize pathogens and their functional characteristics (<em>e.g.</em> virulence genes) in naturally contaminated or purposefully spiked food samples.</p>

<p>The currently available studies used Illumina sequencing, generating short reads. Longer read lengths, generated by third-generation sequencing platforms such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), make it <strong>easier and more practical to identify strains with fewer reads</strong>. MinION (from Oxford Nanopore) is a portable, real-time device for ONT sequencing. Several proof-of-principle studies have shown the <strong>utility of ONT long-read sequencing from metagenomic samples for pathogen identification</strong> (<span class="citation"><a href="#CIUFFREDA20211497">Ciuffreda <i>et al.</i> 2021</a></span>).</p>

When nucleotides pass the pores in the flow cell the current change is translated (basecalled) to nucleotides by a basecaller. A schematic overview is given in the picture above.</p>   <p>When sequencing using a MinIT or MinION Mk1C, the basecalling software is present on the devices. With basecalling the electrical signals are translated to bases (A,T,G,C) with a quality score per base. The sequenced DNA strand will be basecalled and this will form one read. Multiple reads will be stored in a fastq file.</p> </blockquote>
<p><!--END_SNIPPET--></p>

<p>To identify and track foodborne pathogens using long-read metagenomic sequencing, different samples of potentially contaminated food (at different time points or different locations) are prepared, DNA is extracted and sequenced using MinION (ONT). The generated sequencing data then need to be processed using bioinformatics tools.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will be presenting a series of Galaxy workflows whose main goals are to:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>agnostically detect pathogens</strong> (What exactly is this pathogen and what virulence factors does it carry?) from data extracted directly (without prior cultivation) from a potentially contaminated sample (e.g. food like chicken, beef, etc.) and sequenced using Nanopore</li>
  <li><strong>compare different samples to trace</strong> the possible source of contamination</li>
</ol>

<p>To illustrate how to process such data, we will use datasets generated by <a href="https://www.biolytix.ch/">Biolytix</a> with the following approach:</p>

<p><a href="./images/Biolytix_Workflow_Sequencing.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="./images/Biolytix_Workflow_Sequencing.png" alt="From left to right: Biolytix logo. Chicken + milk. An arrow going to the right toward Chicken + milk and a syringe with &quot;Contamination with known pathogens&quot; written below.

" width="1589" height="387" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

<p>Food samples, here chicken, are spiked with known pathogens, here:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica</em>  in the sample named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Barcode 10 Spike 2</code></li>
  <li><em>Salmonella enterica subsp. houtenae</em> in the sample named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Barcode 11 Spike 2b</code></li>
</ul>

<p>DNA in the samples is extracted, analyzed with qPCR, and sequenced via Nanopore. We start the tutorial from raw data generated by Nanopore.</p>

<h2 id="quality-control-and-preprocessing">Quality Control and preprocessing</h2>

<p>During sequencing, errors are introduced, such as incorrect nucleotides being called. These are due to the technical limitations of each sequencing platform. Sequencing errors might bias the analysis and can lead to a misinterpretation of the data. <strong>Sequence quality control is therefore an essential first step in your analysis.</strong></p>

<p>In this tutorial we use similar tools as described in the tutorial <a href="/training-material/topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.html">“Quality control”</a>, but more specific to Nanopore data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quality control with

<p>Generally, we are not interested in the food (host) sequences, rather only those originating from the pathogen itself. It is an important to get rid of all host sequences and to only retain sequences that might include a pathogen, both in order to speed up further steps and to avoid host sequences compromising the analysis.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we know the samples come from <strong>chicken</strong> meat spiked with <strong><em>Salmonella</em></strong> so we already know what will we get as the host and the main pathogen.</p>

<h1 id="taxonomy-profiling">Taxonomy Profiling</h1>

<p>In this section we would like to identify the different organisms found in our samples by assigning taxonomy levels to the reads starting from the kingdom level down to the species level and visualize the result. It’s important to check what might be the species of a possible pathogen to be found, it gets us closer to the investigation as well as discovering possible multiple food infections if any existed.</p>

Taxa are given a taxonomic rank and are aggregated into super groups of higher rank to create a taxonomic hierarchy. The taxonomic hierarchy includes eight levels: <strong>Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus and Species.</strong></p>   <p><img src="/training-material/topics/microbiome/faqs/images/taxonomy.png" alt="Example of taxonomy. It starts, top to bottom, with Kingdom &quot;Animalia&quot;, Phylum &quot;Chordata&quot;, Class &quot;Mammalia&quot;, and Order &quot;Carnivora&quot;. Then it splits in 3. On the left, Family &quot;Felidae&quot;, with 2 genus &quot;Felis&quot; and &quot;Panthera&quot; and below 3 species &quot;F. catus&quot; and &quot;F. pardalis&quot; below &quot;Felis&quot;, &quot;P. pardus&quot; below &quot;Panthera&quot;. In the middle, Family &quot;Canidae&quot;, genus &quot;Canis&quot; and 2 species &quot;C. familiaris&quot; and &quot;C. lupus&quot;. On the right, Family &quot;Ursidae&quot;, Genus &quot;Ursus&quot; and 2 species &quot;U. arctos&quot; and &quot;U. horribilus&quot;. Below each species is a illustration of the species" /></p>   <p>The classification system begins with <strong>3 domains</strong> that encompass all living and extinct forms of life</p>   <ul>   <li>The <strong>Bacteria</strong> and <strong>Archae</strong> are mostly microscopic, but quite widespread.</li>   <li>Domain <strong>Eukarya</strong> contains more complex organisms</li> </ul>   <p>When new species are found, they are assigned into taxa in the taxonomic hierarchy. For example for the cat:</p>   <table>   <thead>     <tr>       <th>Level</th>       <th>Classification</th>     </tr>   </thead>   <tbody>     <tr>       <td>Domain</td>       <td>Eukaryota</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Kingdom</td>       <td>Animalia</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Phylum</td>       <td>Chordata</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Class</td>       <td>Mammalia</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Order</td>       <td>Carnivora</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Family</td>       <td>Felidae</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Genus</td>       <td><em>Felis</em></td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Species</td>       <td><em>F. catus</em></td>     </tr>   </tbody> </table>   <p>From this classification, one can generate a tree of life, also known as a phylogenetic tree. It is a rooted tree that describes the relationship of all life on earth. At the root sits the “last universal common ancestor” and the three main branches (in taxonomy also called domains) are bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Most important for this is the idea that all life on earth is derived from a common ancestor and therefore when comparing two species, you will -sooner or later- find a common ancestor for all of them.</p>   <p>Let’s explore taxonomy in the Tree of Life, using <a href="https://lifemap.univ-lyon1.fr/">Lifemap</a></p>   <iframe id="Lifemap" src="https://lifemap.univ-lyon1.fr/explore.html" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe> </blockquote>

<p>In the previous section we ran <strong>Kraken2</strong> along with the <strong>Kalamari</strong> database, which is also a kind of taxonomy profiling but the database used is designed to include all possible host sequences. In the following part, we run <strong>Kraken2</strong> again; but this time with one of its built-in databases, <strong>Standard PlusPF</strong>, which can give us more insight into pathogen candidate species than <strong>Kalamari</strong>. You can test this yourself by comparing reports of both <strong>Kraken2</strong> runs.</p>

On a computer, the genome sequences are broken into short pieces of length \(k\) (called \(k\)-mers), usually 30bp.</p>   <p><strong>Kraken</strong> examines the \(k\)-mers within the query sequence, searches for them in the database, looks for where these are placed within the taxonomy tree inside the database, makes the classification with the most probable position, then maps \(k\)-mers to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all genomes known to contain the given \(k\)-mer.</p>   <p><img src="/training-material/topics/microbiome/faqs/images/kmers-kraken.jpg" alt="Kraken2" title="Kraken sequence classification algorithm. To classify a sequence, each k-mer in the sequence is mapped to the lowest common ancestor (LCA, i.e. the lowest node) of the genomes that contain that k-mer in the database. The taxa associated with the sequence's k-mers, as well as the taxa's ancestors, form a pruned subtree of the general taxonomy tree, which is used for classification. In the classification tree, each node has a weight equal to the number of k-mers in the sequence associated with the node's taxon. Each root-to-leaf (RTL) path in the classification tree is scored by adding all weights in the path, and the maximal RTL path in the classification tree is the classification path (nodes highlighted in yellow). The leaf of this classification path (the orange, leftmost leaf in the classification tree) is the classification used for the query sequence.

It applies a spaced seed mask of <em>s</em> spaces to the minimizer and calculates a compact hash code, which is then used as a search query in its compact hash table; the lowest common ancestor (LCA) taxon associated with the compact hash code is then assigned to the k-mer.</p>   <p>You can find more information about the <strong>Kraken2</strong> algorithm in the paper <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1891-0"><em>Improved metagenomic analysis with Kraken 2</em></a>.</p> </blockquote>

<p>In order to view the taxonomy profiling produced by <strong>Kraken2</strong> tool, there are a lot of tools to be used afterwards such as <strong>Krona pie chart</strong>, however too many species were detected to be shown by this tool. For that reason, we have chosen the <strong>Phinch visualization</strong> interactive tool as it contains multiple visualization plots, it is interactive alowing you to choose between different parameters, you can visualize each taxonomic level on its own, you can have the metadata of the samples represented along with the taxonomic visualization, download all plots for publications and a lot of other benefits. For later, you can check out <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/4/1303/5573755"><strong>Pavian</strong></a> tool as well it can replace <strong>Phinch visualization</strong> with similar outputs.</p>

<p><strong>Phinch visualization</strong> needs a <strong>BIOM</strong> file format as an input, and for that we need the <a href="https://github.com/smdabdoub/kraken-biom"><strong>Kraken-Biom</strong></a>  tool to convert the <strong>Kraken2</strong> tabular output into a Biom file.</p>

  <p>While these steps are running, you can move on to the next section <strong>Gene based pathogenic identification</strong> and run the steps there, as well. Both analyses can execute in parallel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may have noticed some sequences have been assigned to the Human Genome (Homosapians) species, when we run <strong>Kraken2</strong> using the <strong>Standard PlusPF</strong> in this section. However, in the <strong>pre-processing</strong> section when we ran <strong>Kraken2</strong> with <strong>Kalamari</strong> no Human Genomes were found. The lab (data producers) has confirmed that these sequences assigned to human by <strong>Standard PlusPF</strong> database are not human and there should be no human sequences in the samples as <strong>Kalamari</strong> database result’s confirmed. So these sequences were wrongly assigned to human by <strong>Standard PlusPF</strong>. That is due to resemblance between organisms and the limited species coverage of <strong>Kraken2</strong> databases sometimes do happen that reads corresponding to higher organisms get mapped to humans. It was a very severe problem for the <strong>Standard PlusPF</strong>, because yeast genes were mis-assigned to human.</p>

<p>We decide to keep these sequences since we do not know what are they via the <strong>taxonomy profiling</strong> step, which could mean that they might be identified as pathogens in the coming steps, and if we delete them we are possibly losing important information and losing the main goal of the workflow to detect pathogens and track them.</p>

<h1 id="gene-based-pathogenic-identification">Gene based pathogenic identification</h1>

<p>With taxonomy profiling, we identified some bacterial species. But we want to be sure they are pathogenic, by <strong>looking for genes known to be linked to pathogenicity or to the pathogenecity character</strong> of the organim:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/virulence-factor"><strong>Virulence Factor (VF)</strong></a>: gene products, usually proteins, involved in pathogenicity. By identifiying them we can call a pathogen and its severity level</li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/antibiotic-resistance-genes"><strong>Antimicrobial Resistance genes (AMR)</strong></a>.</p>

    <p>These type of genes have three fundamental mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance that are enzymatic degradation of antibacterial drugs, alteration of bacterial proteins that are antimicrobial targets, and changes in membrane permeability to antibiotics, which will lead to not altering the target site and spread throughput the pathogenic bacteria decreasing the overall fitness of the host.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To look for these genes and determine the strain of the bacteria we are testing for pathogenicity we use <strong>Multilocus Sequence Typing</strong> approach and dedicated <a href="https://pubmlst.org/">pubMLST datases</a> database:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Genome assembly to get contigs, i.e. longer sequences, using <strong>metaflye</strong> (<span class="citation"><a href="#flye">Kolmogorov <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>)  then assembly polishing using <a href="https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka"><strong>medaka consensus pipeline</strong></a> and visualizing the assembly graph using <strong>Bandage Image</strong> (<span class="citation"><a href="#Wick2015">Wick <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>)</li>
  <li>Generate an <strong>MLST</strong> report with <strong>MLST</strong> tool that scans genomes against PubMLST schemes</li>
  <li>Generate reports with <strong>AMR</strong> genes and <strong>VF</strong> using <a href="https://github.com/tseemann/abricate"><strong>ABRicate</strong></a></li>
</ol>

<p>As outputs, we will get our <strong>FASTA</strong> and <strong>Tabular</strong> files to track genes and visualize our pathogenic identification. For that we will need one more file to create a report and we can upload it directly:</p>

<p><strong>MLST</strong> tool is used to scan the <a href="https://pubmlst.org/">pubMLST</a> database against PubMLST typing schemes. It’s one of the analyses that you can perform on your dataset to determine the allele IDs, you can also detect novel alleles. This step is not essential to identify pathogens and track them in the remainder of this tutorial, however we wanted to show some of the analysis that one can use Galaxy in to understand more about the dataset, as well as identifying the strain that might be a pathogen or not.</p>

<h2 id="antimicrobial-resistance-genes">Antimicrobial Resistance Genes</h2>

<p>Now, to search <strong>AMR</strong> genes among our samples’ contigs, we run <strong>ABRicate</strong> and choose the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6811410/"><strong>NCBI Bacterial Antimicrobial Resistance Gene Database (AMRFinderPlus)</strong></a> from the advanced options of the tool. The tool checks if there is an AMR found or not, if found then in which contig it is, its location on the contig, what the name of the exact product is, what substance it provides resistance against and a lot of other information regarding the found <strong>AMR</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="virulence-factor-identification">Virulence Factor identification</h2>

<p>In this step we return back to the main goal of the tutorial where we want to identify the pathogens: <strong>identify if the bacteria found in our samples are pathogenic bacteria or not</strong>. One of the ways to do that is to identify if the sequences include genes with a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2646308/">Virulence Facor</a> or not, such that if the samples include gene(s) with a Virulence Factor then it for sure is a pathogen.</p>

<blockquote class="comment">
  <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-definitions"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment: Definitions</div>

  <p><strong>Bacterial Pathogen</strong>: A bacterial pathogen is usually defined as any bacterium that has the capacity to cause disease. Its ability to cause disease is called pathogenicity.</p>

  <p><strong>Virulence</strong>: Virulence provides a quantitative measure of the pathogenicity or the likelihood of causing a disease.</p>

  <p><strong>Virulence Factors</strong>: Virulence factors refer to the properties (i.e., gene products) that enable a microorganism to establish itself on or within a host of a particular species and enhance its potential to cause disease. Virulence factors include bacterial toxins, cell surface proteins that mediate bacterial attachment, cell surface carbohydrates and proteins that protect a bacterium, and hydrolytic enzymes that may contribute to the pathogenicity of the bacterium.</p>

<h1 id="snp-based-pathogenic-identification">SNP based pathogenic identification</h1>

<p>Now we would like to identify pathogens with a third approach based on variant and <a href="https://genome.sph.umich.edu/w/images/e/e6/Seqshop_may_2015_day2_snp_lecture_v2.pdf">single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) calling</a>: comparison of reads to a targeted reference genome, and call the differences between sample reads and reference genomes to identify variants.</p>

<p>For example, if we want to check whether our samples include <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/index.html"><em>Campylobacter</em> pathogenic strains</a> or not, we will map our samples against the reference genome of the <em>Campylobacter</em> species. Variants in specific positions on the genome are queried to judge if these variations would indicate a pathogen or not.</p>

<p>This approach also allows identification of novel alleles and possible <strong>new variants of the pathogen</strong>.</p>

<p>Using this approach, we also build the consensus genome of each sample, so we can later build a phylogenetic tree of all samples’ full genomes and have an insight into events that occurred during the evolution of same or different species in the samples.</p>

<p>In this training, we are testing <em>Salmonella enterica</em>, with different strains of which our samples were spiked. So we will now upload to our history the reference genome of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=txid99287[Organism:exp]"><em>S. enterica</em></a> we originally obtained from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database</a>.</p>

<h2 id="consensus-genome-building">Consensus Genome Building</h2>

<p>For further anaylsis we have included one more step in this section, where we build the full genome of our samples.</p>

<p>This consensus genome can be used later to compare and relate samples together based on their full genome. In cases such as SARS-CoV2, it is important to do so in order to discover new outbreaks. In this example of the training, it is not really important to draw a tree of the full genomes of the samples as <em>Salmonella</em> does not have such a speedy outbreak as SARS-CoV2 does. However, we decided to include it in the workflow for any further analysis of the users, if needed.</p>

<p>For this step we run <a href="https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html"><strong>bcftools consensus</strong></a> (<span class="citation"><a href="#Li20092">Li <i>et al.</i> 2009</a></span>).</p>

<p>In this last section, we would like to show how to aggregate results and use the results to help tracking pathogenes among samples by:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Drawing a presence-absence heatmap of the identified <strong>VF</strong> genes within all samples to visualize in which samples these genes can be found.</li>
  <li>Drawing a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/phylogenetic-tree">phylogenetic tree</a> for each pathogenic gene detected, where we will relate the contigs of the samples together where this gene is found.</li>
</ol>

<p>With these two types of visualizations we can have an overview of all samples and the genes, but also how samples are related to each other i.e. which common pathogenic genes they share. Given the time of the sampling and the location one can easily identify using these graphs, where and when the contamination has occurred among the different samples.</p>

<h2 id="heatmap">Heatmap</h2>

<p>A heatmap is one of the visualization techniques that can give you a complete overview of all the samples together and whether or not a certain value exists. In this tutorial, we use the heatmap to visualize all samples aside and check which common bacteria pathogen genes are found in samples and which is only found in one of them.</p>

<p>We use <strong>Heatmap w ggplot</strong> tool along with other tabular manipulating tools to prepare the tabular files.</p>

      <li><strong>AAG03023</strong> is only found in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Barcode10</code> sample and <strong>NP_460360</strong> is only found in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Barcode11</code> sample</li>
      <li>
        <p>Both samples were spiked with the same pathogen species, <em>S. enterica</em>, but not the same strain:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Barcode10</code> sample is spiked with <em>S. enterica subsp. enterica</em> strain</li>
          <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Barcode11</code> sample is spiked with <em>S. enterica subsp. houtenae</em> strain.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This can be the main cause of the big similarities and the few differences of the bacteria pathogen <strong>VF</strong> gene products found between both of the two samples.
Other factors such as the <strong>time</strong> and <strong>location</strong> of the sampling may cause other differences. By knowing the metadata of the samples inputted for the workflows in real life we can understand what actually happened. We can have samples with no pathogen found then we start detecting genes from the 7th or 8th sample, then we can identify where and when the pathogen entered the host, and stop the cause of that</p>

<h2 id="phylogenetic-tree-building">Phylogenetic Tree building</h2>

<p>Phylogenetic trees can be used to track the evolution of the pathogen between the samples. Therefore, the VFs are used as a marker gene for the pathogen, similar to 16S marker genes for species profiling. We use the VFs since we know they are associated to the pathogenicity of the sample. By observing the created trees one can identify groups of related pathogens. If additional meta data of the samples would be available one could further identify groups that are associated to specific traits such as increase pathogenicity or faster transmission. Consequently, the tree could be used for phylogenetic placement of unknwon samples.</p>

<p>For the phylogenetic trees, for each bacteria pathogen gene found in the samples we use <strong>ClustalW</strong> (<span class="citation"><a href="#Larkin2007">Larkin <i>et al.</i> 2007</a></span>) for <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/multiple-sequence-alignment">Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)</a> needed before constructing a phylogenetic tree, for the tree itself we use <strong>FASTTREE</strong> and <strong>Newick Display</strong> (<span class="citation"><a href="#Dress2008">Dress <i>et al.</i> 2008</a></span>) to visualize it.</p>

<div class="Long-Version">

  <p>To get the sequence to align, we need to extract the sequences of the VFs in the contigs:</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In this tutorial, we have tried the workflow designed to detect and track pathogens in our food and drinks. Through out the full workflow we used our Nanopore sequenced datasets from Biolytix and analyzed it, found the pathogens and tracked it. This approach can be summarized with the following scheme:</p>
