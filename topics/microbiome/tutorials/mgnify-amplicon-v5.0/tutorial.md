Amplicon sequencing is a powerful research method designed to explore and reveal the taxonomic composition of diverse microbial communities. By focusing on specific genetic regions, researchers can gain insights into the structure and function of these communities. Typically, ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) or ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) is sequenced, with particular attention given to key marker genes. For bacteria and archaea, the 16S rRNA gene is commonly targeted; for eukaryotes, the 18S rRNA gene is used, while fungi are often studied through internal transcribed spacers (ITS) regions. These marker genes provide the genetic signatures necessary for identifying and categorizing the various organisms present within a sample.<br>

In this tutorial, we will dive into the MGnify amplicon pipeline v5.0 on Galaxy, a sophisticated toolset for microbial analysis. This pipeline is a ported version of the same well-established amplicon pipeline used by MGnify, a leading metagenomics platform dedicated to the analysis and archiving of microbiome sequences. MGnify has seen significant adoption and growth in recent years ({%cite Richardson2022%}); as of the time of writing, over 495,889 analyses have been conducted using this pipeline for amplicon data alone ({%cite ebi_metagenomics%}).<br>

<div style="width:45%; margin: auto;">
![](./images/pipeline_v5.0_amplicon.png)  <strong>The workflow of the MGnify amplicon pipeline v5.0</strong> ({%cite ebi_amplicon_pipeline%}). The figure illustrates the workflow of the MGnify amplicon pipeline, beginning with quality control to filter low-quality reads. The processed reads then proceed to the rRNA-prediction step, where SSU and LSU regions are classified and their taxonomic abundance is visualized. Following this, the pipeline handles the ITS regions, classifying them and visualizing their taxonomic abundance using pie charts. Each stage is clearly outlined, showcasing how data moves through the pipeline and is analyzed to provide comprehensive insights into microbial communities.

Our journey through this tutorial will provide a comprehensive understanding of the different sub-workflows that make up the pipeline and how each contributes to the overall analysis process. We will explore how these workflows are executed within the Galaxy platform. Additionally, we will explore which databases and tools are integrated into the pipeline, giving us a clearer picture of the resources that power these analyses. By the end of this tutorial you will have the knowledge to apply the MGnify amplicon pipeline effectively in your own research.<br>

Before diving into the tutorial, it is strongly recommended to review the Introduction to Microbiome Analysis slides or watch the corresponding video, which are linked in the requirements section above, especially if you are new to this field. These slides will provide essential background knowledge and help you better understand the concepts covered in this tutorial.

> <warning-title>Slight discrepancy between runs</warning-title>
> The outputs generated by this workflow may vary slightly between runs due to the non-deterministic behavior of the MAPseq version used. While this variation does not always occur, certain processing steps involve elements of randomness that can lead to minor differences in the results on different executions.

In this tutorial, we'll cover two different versions:
1. Running the workflows using NCBI data (default)
2. Running the workflows using own reads, which requires some minor adjustments

To keep things straightforward, we will be working with two small datasets throughout this tutorial. These datasets are specifically chosen to demonstrate the full range of outputs that this pipeline can generate, allowing us to explore each type of result without being overwhelmed by large-scale data.

# Quality control
Quality control (QC) is a crucial first step in any metagenomic analysis pipeline. It ensures that sequencing reads are free from contaminants, low-quality bases, and adapter sequences, which can negatively impact downstream analyses. In the MGnify v5.0 pipeline, QC involves trimming, filtering, and assessing read quality using tools like Trimmomatic, SeqPrep, and FastQC. This process guarantees that only high-quality data progresses, providing reliable results for subsequent steps like taxonomic classification and diversity analysis.<br>
The quality control phase in this amplicon pipeline is split into two sub-workflows: one dedicated to paired-end reads and another for single-end reads

## Single-end reads

# Summary tables
The summary tables sub-workflow takes as input the taxonomic abundance tables generated from all datasets within the pipeline. It processes these tables to create two comprehensive taxonomic summary tables:
1. Full Taxonomic Summary Table: This table provides detailed taxonomic information spanning all levels, from superkingdom down to species. It offers a complete overview of the taxonomic composition across all samples, facilitating in-depth analyses of microbial communities.

2. Phylum-Level Summary Table: Focused specifically on the phylum level, this table aggregates data to provide a clear view of the phylum distribution within the datasets. This level-specific summary is particularly useful for high-level comparisons and identifying major trends within the microbial communities.

Both summary tables serve as essential tools for downstream interpretation, helping to visualize and compare the taxonomic profiles across multiple samples (e.g. [Calculating α and β diversity]({% link topics/microbiome/tutorials/diversity/tutorial.md %})).
