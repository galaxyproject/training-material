Characterization of fungal communities with amplicon data is particularly difficult, since fungi exhibit high genetic diversity, complex ecological interactions, and varying levels of abundance across environments. Additionally, the presence of PCR biases, sequencing errors, and uneven coverage further complicates accurate analysis and interpretation {% cite de_filippis_different_2017 %}.

LotuS2, is a tool designed to address some of the challenges associated with analyzing amplicon sequencing data, including data generated from ITS (internal transcribed spacer) regions for fungal community analysis {% ozkurt_lotus2_2022 %}.

# Title for your first section

Give some background about what the trainees will be doing in the section.
Remember that many people reading your materials will likely be novices,
so make sure to explain all the relevant concepts.

## Title for a subsection
Section and subsection titles will be displayed in the tutorial index on the left side of
the page, so try to make them informative and concise!

# Hands-on Sections
Below are a series of hand-on boxes, one for each tool in your workflow file.
Often you may wish to combine several boxes into one or make other adjustments such
as breaking the tutorial into sections, we encourage you to make such changes as you
see fit, this is just a starting point :)

Anywhere you find the word "***TODO***", there is something that needs to be changed
depending on the specifics of your tutorial.

have fun!

# Title of the section usually corresponding to a big step in the analysis

It comes first a description of the step: some background and some theory.
Some image can be added there to support the theory explanation:

![Alternative text](../../images/image_name "Legend of the image")

The idea is to keep the theory description before quite simple to focus more on the practical part.

***TODO***: *Consider adding a detail box to expand the theory*

> <details-title> More details about the theory </details-title>
>
> But to describe more details, it is possible to use the detail boxes which are expandable
>
{: .details}

A big step can have several subsections or sub steps:

## Re-arrange

To create the template, each step of the workflow had its own subsection.

***TODO***: *Re-arrange the generated subsections into sections or other subsections.
Consider merging some hands-on boxes to have a meaningful flow of the analyses*
