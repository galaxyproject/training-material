@article{Berger.1970,
 abstract = {The diversity of a planktonic foraminiferal assemblage on the ocean floor depends on the state of preservation of that assemblage. As dissolution progresses, species diversity (number of species in the assemblage) decreases, but compound diversity (based on relative species abundance) first increases and then decreases; species dominance first decreases and then increases. The reason for these changes is that the species most susceptible to solution deliver moresediment to the ocean floor than do species with solution-resistant shells, possibly because the more soluble tests are produced in surface waters, where growth and production are greatest.},

@article{BonillaRosso.2012,
 abstract = {Metagenomics holds the promise of greatly advancing the study of diversity in natural communities, but novel theoretical and methodological approaches must first be developed and adjusted for these data sets. We evaluated widely used macroecological metrics of taxonomic diversity on a simulated set of metagenomic samples, using phylogenetically meaningful protein-coding genes as ecological proxies. To our knowledge, this is the first approach of this kind to evaluate taxonomic diversity metrics derived from metagenomic data sets. We demonstrate that abundance matrices derived from protein-coding marker genes reproduce more faithfully the structure of the original community than those derived from SSU-rRNA gene. We also found that the most commonly used diversity metrics are biased estimators of community structure and differ significantly from their corresponding real parameters and that these biases are most likely caused by insufficient sampling and differences in community phylogenetic composition. Our results suggest that the ranking of samples using multidimensional metrics makes a good qualitative alternative for contrasting community structure and that these comparisons can be greatly improved with the incorporation of metrics for both community structure and phylogenetic diversity. These findings will help to achieve a standardized framework for community diversity comparisons derived from metagenomic data sets.},

@article{Finotello.2018,
 abstract = {The human microbiota is a complex ecological community of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms harboured by the human body. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, in particular targeted amplicon sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S-seq), are enabling the identification and quantification of human-resident microorganisms at unprecedented resolution, providing novel insights into the role of the microbiota in health and disease. Once microbial abundances are quantified through NGS data analysis, diversity indices provide valuable mathematical tools to describe the ecological complexity of a single sample or to detect species differences between samples. However, diversity is not a determined physical quantity for which a consensus definition and unit of measure have been established, and several diversity indices are currently available. Furthermore, they were originally developed for macroecology and their robustness to the possible bias introduced by sequencing has not been characterized so far. To assist the reader with the selection and interpretation of diversity measures, we review a panel of broadly used indices, describing their mathematical formulations, purposes and properties, and characterize their behaviour and criticalities in dependence of the data features using simulated data as ground truth. In addition, we make available an R package, DiversitySeq, which implements in a unified framework the full panel of diversity indices and a simulator of 16S-seq data, and thus represents a valuable resource for the analysis of diversity from NGS count data and for the benchmarking of computational methods for 16S-seq.},
