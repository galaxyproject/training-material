> The 16S rRNA gene has several properties that make it ideally suited for our purposes
>
> 1. Present in all prokaryotes
> 2. Highly conserved + highly variable regions
> 3. Huge reference databases
>
> ![16S Variable regions](../../images/16S_variableregions.jpg)
>
> The highly conserved regions make it easy to target the gene across different organisms,
> while the highly variable regions allow us to distinguish between different species.
