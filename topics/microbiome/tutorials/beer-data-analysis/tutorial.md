What is a microbiome? It is a collection of small living creatures.
These small creatures are called **micro-organisms** and they are **everywhere**. In our gut,
in the soil, on vending machines, and even inside the beer. Most of these micro-organisms are
actually very good for us, but some can make us very ill.

Micro-organisms come in different shapes and sizes, but they have the same components.
One crucial component is the **DNA**, the blueprint of life. The DNA encodes the
shape and size and many other characteristics unique to a species. Because DNA is so species-specific,
reading the DNA can be used to identify what kind of micro-organism
the it is from. Therefore, within a metagenomic specimen, *e.g.* a sample form soil, gut,
or beer, one can identify what kind of species are inside the sample.

In this tutorial, we will use data of beer microbiome generated via the
[BeerDEcoded project](https://streetscience.community/projects/beerdecoded/).

{: .comment}

During one BeerDEcoded workshop, we extracted yeasts out of a bottle of
[Chimay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimay_Brewery). We then
extracted the DNA of these yeasts and sequenced it using a MinION to obtain the DNA
sequences. Now, we would like to **identify the yeast species** sequenced there, and
thereby **outline the diversity of microorganisms** (the microbiome community) in the beer
sample.

To get this information, we need to process the sequenced data in a few steps:
1. Check the quality of the data
2. Assign a taxonomic label, *i.e.* assign 'species' to each sequence
3. Visualize the distribution of the different species

This type of data analysis requires running several bioinformatics tools and
usually requires a computer science background. [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) is
an open-source platform for data analysis that enables anyone to use bioinformatics
tools through its graphical web interface, accessible via any Web browser.

So, in this tutorial, we will use Galaxy to extract and visualize the community
of yeasts from a bottle of beer.

# Prepare Galaxy and data

First of all, this tutorial will get you hands on with some basic Galaxy tasks, including creating a history and importing data.

## Get familiar with Galaxy

> <hands-on-title>Open Galaxy</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Open your favorite browser (Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari but not Internet Explorer!)
> 2. Create a Galaxy account if you do not have one
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/account_create.md %}
>
{: .hands_on}

The Galaxy homepage is divided into three panels:
* Tools on the left
* Viewing panel in the middle
* History of analysis and files on the right

![Galaxy interface screenshot showing history panel on the right, tools panel on the left, and main panel at the center]({% link topics/introduction/images/galaxy_interface.png %} "The Galaxy interface")

The first time you use Galaxy, there will be no files in your history panel.

Any analysis should get its own Galaxy history. So let's start by creating a new one:

> <hands-on-title>Prepare the Galaxy history</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Create a new history for this analysis
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/histories_create_new.md %}
>
> 2. Rename the history
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/histories_rename.md %}
>
{: .hands_on}

## Get data

Before we can begin any Galaxy analysis, we need to upload the input data: FASTQ files

> <hands-on-title>Upload your dataset</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Import the sequenced data including fastq in the name
>
>    - Option 1 [{% icon video %}](https://youtu.be/FFCDx1rMGAQ): Your own local data using **Upload Data** (recommended for 1-10 datasets).
>
>      {% snippet faqs/galaxy/datasets_upload.md %}
>
>    - Option 2: From Zenodo, an external server, via URL

>
>      {% snippet faqs/galaxy/datasets_import_via_link.md %}
>
>    Your uploaded file is now in your current history. When the file is fully uploaded to Galaxy, it will turn green. But, what is this file?
>
> 2. Click on the {% icon galaxy-eye %} (eye) icon next to the dataset name to look at the file contents.
>
{: .hands_on}

The contents of the file will be displayed in the central Galaxy panel.

This file contains the sequences, also called **reads**, of DNA, *i.e.* succession of nucleotides, for all fragments from the yeasts in the beer, in FASTQ format.

{% snippet topics/sequence-analysis/faqs/fastq.md %}

# Data quality

## Assess data quality

Before starting to work on our data, it is necessary to assess its quality. This is an essential step if we aim to obtain a **meaningful downstream analysis**.

**FastQC** is one of the most widely used tools to **check the quality** of data generated by High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technologies.

> <hands-on-title>Quality check</hands-on-title>

{: .question}

**FastQC** provides information on various parameters, such as the range of quality values across all bases at each position:

![FastQC Per base sequence quality with scores below 20](./images/fastqc_1.png "Per base sequence quality. X-axis: position in the reads (in base pair). Y-axis: quality score, between 0 and 40 - the higher the score, the better the base call. For each position, a boxplot is drawn with: the median value, represented by the central red line;the inter-quartile range (25-75%), represented by the yellow box; the 10% and 90% values in the upper and lower whiskers; and the mean quality, represented by the blue line. The background of the graph divides the y-axis into very good quality scores (green), scores of reasonable quality (orange), and reads of poor quality (red).")

We can see that the quality of our sequencing data grows after the first few bases, stays around a score of 18 and then decreases again at the end of the sequences. MinION and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) are known to have a higher error rate compared to other sequencing techniques and platforms ({% cite delahaye2021sequencing %}).

For more detailed information about the other plots in the FASTQC report, check out our [dedicated tutorial]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.md %}).

## Improve the dataset quality

In order to improve the quality of our data, we will use two tools:
- **porechop** ({% cite rrwick2017 %}) to remove adapters that were added for sequencing and chimera (contaminant)
- **fastp** ({% cite Chen_2018 %}) to filter sequences with low quality scores (below 10)

# Assign taxonomic classification

One of the main aims in microbiome data analysis is to identify the organisms sequenced. For that we try to **identify the taxon** to which each individual read belong.

{% snippet topics/microbiome/faqs/taxon.md %}

> <question-title></question-title>

The majority of beers contain a yeast genus called ***Saccharomyces*** and 2 species in that genus: *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (ale yeast) and *Saccharomyces pastorianus* (lager yeast). The used beer is an ale beer, so we expect to find ***Saccharomyces cerevisiae***. But other yeasts can also have been used and then found. We could also have some DNA left from other beer components, but also contaminations by other microorganisms and even human DNA from people who manipulated the beer or did the extraction.

Taxonomic assignment or classification is the process of assigning an **Operational Taxonomic Unit** (OTUs, that is, groups of related individuals / taxon) to sequences. To assign an OTU to a sequence it is compared against a database, but this comparison can be done in different ways, with different bioinformatics tools. Here we will use **Kraken2** ({% cite wood2019improved %}).

{% snippet topics/microbiome/faqs/kraken.md %}

> <hands-on-title>Kraken2</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [Kraken2](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/kraken2/kraken2/2.1.1+galaxy1) %} with the following parameters:
>    - *"Single or paired reads"*: `Single`
>        - {% icon param-file %} *"Input sequences"*: Output of **fastp**
>    - *"Print scientific names instead of just taxids"*: `Yes`
>    - In *"Create Report"*:
>        - *"Print a report with aggregrate counts/clade to file"*: `Yes`
>    - *"Select a Kraken2 database"*: `Prebuilt Refseq indexes: PlusPF`
>
>      The database here contains reference sequences and taxonomies. We need to
>      be sure it contains yeasts, i.e. fungi.
>
> 2. Inspect the report file
{: .hands_on}

The Kraken report is a tabular files with one line per taxon and 6 columns or fields:

1. Percentage of fragments covered by the clade rooted at this taxon
2. Number of fragments covered by the clade rooted at this taxon
3. Number of fragments assigned directly to this taxon
4. A rank code, indicating
    - (U)nclassified
    - (R)oot
    - (D)omain
    - (K)ingdom
    - (P)hylum
    - (C)lass
    - (O)rder
    - (F)amily
    - (G)enus, or
    - (S)pecies

    Taxa that are not at any of these 10 ranks have a rank code that is formed by using the rank code of the closest ancestor rank with a number indicating the distance from that rank. E.g., `G2` is a rank code indicating a taxon is between genus and species and the grandparent taxon is at the genus rank.

5. NCBI taxonomic ID number
6. Indented scientific name

Other taxons than yeast have been identified. They could be contamination or misidentification of reads. Indeed, many taxons have less than 5 reads assigned. We will filter these reads out to get a better view of the possible contaminations.

# Visualize the community

Once we have assigned the corresponding taxa to the sequences, the next step is to properly visualize the data: visualize the diversity of taxons at different levels.

To do that, we will use the tool **Krona** ({% cite Ondov_2011 %}). But before that, we need to adjust the output from Kraken2 to the requirements of **Krona**. Indeed, **Krona** expects as input a table with the first column containing a count and the remaining columns describing the hierarchy. Currently, we have a report tabular file with the first column containing the taxonomy and the second column the number of reads. We will now use another tool, which also provides taxonomic classification, but it produces the exact formatting Krona needs.

We can now run **Krona**. This tool creates an interactive report that allows hierarchical data (like taxonomy) to be explored with zooming, as multi-layered pie charts. With this tool, we can easily visualize the composition of a microbiome community.

# Investigate the beer microbiome

Let's come back to our original question: characterization of the beer microbiome, specially looking at the yeasts.

Yeasts do not form a single taxonomic group ({% cite kurtzman1994molecular %}). They are parts of the fungi kingdom but belong two separate phyla: the Ascomycota and the Basidiomycota.

Microbiome of several beers, including Chimay beers, have been previously investigated by targeting specifically the fungi, in which we can find yeasts ({% cite sobel2017beerdecoded %}):

![Heatmap with rows being type of beers and columns fungi species. For the rows, the name of beers are on the right and clustering tree on the left side of the heatmap. For the columns, the name of the species are on the bottom and the clustering tree on the top. The fungi species are sorted from the least abundant on the left to the most abundant on the right.](./images/beerdecoded.gif "Heatmap of the number of reads per internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing of fungal species per beer. Source {% cite sobel2017beerdecoded %}")

The species identified for Chimay beers are (from the most abundant to the least one):
- *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*
- *Saccharomyces mikatea*: a species generally used in winemaking ({% cite bellon2013introducing %})
- *Kazachstania martiniae*: *Kazachstania* is a genus from the family Saccharomycetaceaethe.
- *Saccharomyces kudriavzevii*
- *Brettanomyces bruxellensis*

    *Brettanomyces* is a non-spore forming genus of yeast in the family Saccharomycetaceae, and is important to both the brewing and wine industries due to the sensory compounds it produces. 

    *Brettanomyces bruxellensis* is typically used for the production of the Belgian beers.

- *Saccharomyces paradoxus*: a wild yeast species closely related to *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*
- *Kazachstania kunashirensis*
- *Saccharomyces cariocanus*: a wild yeast species closely related to *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*
- *Filobasidium magnum*
- *Malasseria restricta*
- *Pichia kudriavzevii*
- *Aureobasidium pullulans*
- *Sporidiobolus metaroseus*
