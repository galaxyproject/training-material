               flexible and powerful software package for analyzing sequencing
               data. As a case study, we used mothur to trim, screen, and align
               sequences; calculate distances; assign sequences to operational
               taxonomic units; and describe the alpha and beta diversity of
               eight marine samples previously characterized by pyrosequencing
               of 16S rRNA gene fragments. This analysis of more than 222,000
