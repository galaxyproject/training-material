  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Repbase is a reference database of eukaryotic
               repetitive DNA, which includes prototypic sequences of repeats
               and basic information described in annotations. Updating and
               maintenance of the database requires specialized tools, which we
               have created and made available for use with Repbase, and which
               may be useful as a template for other curated databases.
               RESULTS: We describe the software tools RepbaseSubmitter and
               Censor, which are designed to facilitate updating and screening
               the content of Repbase. RepbaseSubmitter is a java-based
               interface for formatting and annotating Repbase entries. It
               eliminates many common formatting errors, and automates actions
               such as calculation of sequence lengths and composition, thus
               facilitating curation of Repbase sequences. In addition, it has
               several features for predicting protein coding regions in
               sequences; searching and including Pubmed references in Repbase
               entries; and searching the NCBI taxonomy database for correct
               inclusion of species information and taxonomic position. Censor
               is a tool to rapidly identify repetitive elements by comparison
               to known repeats. It uses WU-BLAST for speed and sensitivity,
               and can conduct DNA-DNA, DNA-protein, or translated
               DNA-translated DNA searches of genomic sequence. Defragmented
               output includes a map of repeats present in the query sequence,
               with the options to report masked query sequence(s), repeat
               sequences found in the query, and alignments. CONCLUSION: Censor
               and RepbaseSubmitter are available as both web-based services
               and downloadable versions. They can be found at
               http://www.girinst.org/repbase/submission.html
