# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

<!-- This is a comment. -->

A robust and well-resolved phylogenetic classification is essential to understand genetic relationships within and between species and the evolution of their phenotypic diversity. In the last decade the genomic revolution has represented a drastic change in the amount of data used for phylogenetic inference. The single-gene approach using universal phylogenetic markers for the different lineages across the tree of life, is now being replaced by the assembly of taxon-rich and genome-scale data matrices, the so called phylogenomic approach.

Molecular sequence data can be used to construct a phylogeny by comparing differences between nucleotide or amino acid sequences across species or strains, a technique called phylogenomics. {% cite Young2019 %} have written a comprehensive review on the topic of phylogenomics.
In this tutorial we prepare genetic sequence data for phylogenetic reconstruction.
We will use sequences from chromosome 5 of five strains of the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. This requires first the prediction of protein coding genes from the genome. We use Funannotate to predict protein-coding genes . Next, we find the proteins that are present in more than one genome, called orthologs, using Proteinortho, and extract a subset with orthologs that are present in all samples. Finally, each set of orthologs is aligned using ClustalW. The resulting dataset is ready to be used for phylogenetic reconstruction.

# Get data
For this training we will use a subset of the genome (chromosome 5) from four strains of *S. cerevisiae*. The GenBank annotated sequenced were produced using 'funannotate predict annotation' (Galaxy Version 1.8.9+galaxy2) on the nucleotide sequences sequences.

# Genome annotation

## Mask repetitive sequences
Before we can annotate the genome, we will prepare the data by masking repetitive sequences in the genome.
Repeat-rich regions can interfere with genome annotation tools. In this step we find and soft-mask repetitive regions in the genome. The annotation tool can then take this information into account ([see RepeatMasker tutorial for more details]({% link topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/repeatmasker/tutorial.md %})).
We use **RepeatMasker**
{% cite RepeatMasker %}, a program that screens DNA sequences for interspersed repeats and low complexity DNA sequences.
This program has historically made use of [RepBase](https://www.girinst.org/repbase/update/index.html) ({%cite Kohany2006-ks %}), a service of the Genetic Information Research Institute, but this database in no longer open access. Instead, we will use [Dfam](https://www.dfam.org/home) ({%cite Storer2021 %}) an open collection of Transposable Element DNA sequence alignments,  HMMs derived from Repbase sequences and consensus sequences. For this reason, the annotation of repetitive sequences might be incomplete.

RepeatMasker will only accept compact fasta headers. Before we can mask repetitive regions with RepeatMasker we must trim the NCBI long header (`BK006939.2 TPA_inf: Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C chromosome V, complete sequence`) to leave only the accession number (`>BK006939.2`) by using a regular expression.

## Annotate with Funannotate
We will predict protein-coding genes from genomic sequences using [Funannotate](https://funannotate.readthedocs.io/) ({% cite Young2019 %}), which collects evidence from different ab-initio gene predictors as well as from RNA-seq or ESTs data. Funannotate has been developed for Fungi but it works with any Eukaryotic genome. The output of Funannotate is a list of ORFs and their translation in GenBank format.

If you would like to learn about genome annotation in more depth, the GTN has a [section]({{ site.baseurl }}/topics/genome-annotation) dedicated to training on genome annotation, including a hands-on tutorial on [Funannotate]({% link topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/funannotate/tutorial.md %}).

> ### {% icon warning %} Slow Step Ahead!

## Extract ORFs into FASTA files
In this step, we extract the protein sequences from the GenBank files into multi-FASTA files. Additionally, we modify the headers to include the accession number of the sample. This creates an unique accession-proteinID header for each predicted protein, and will allow us to retrieve them after we combine all predicted proteins into one multi-FASTA file.

So far, we have kept sequence files in a collection. Now we will combine all predicted proteins from all samples into one big multi-fasta file. Later, we will retrieve ortholog sequences from this file.

# Find orthologs

Orthologs are genes in different species evolved from a common ancestral gene by a speciation (lineage-splitting) event and contain the information needed for building phylogenies. The input for this step is the collection of multi-FASTA extracted from the GenBank file and modified to have unique headers.
The result file 'orthology-groups' contains one row per orthogroup and one column per sample.

Next, we select orthogroups where all the species are represented by only one protein, 1:1 single copy orthologs (a total of 4 proteins per orthogroup for this dataset).

## Quality control with **Busco**
Busco is a dataset of nearl-universal, single-copy orthologs.
Here we use it for QC of the assembly and annotation produced above.
It outputs a proxy of completeness, duplication and fragmentation of the annotation (Busco can also be used to assess the completeness of a genome assembly).

## Extract proteins with Proteinortho
Next we extract 1:1 single copy orthologs and generate one multi fasta file per ortholog.  
The output is a collection of multi-fasta ortholog files. All species are represented in each file and are ready to be aligned.

>
>
{: .hands_on}




# Align ortholog sequences
Alignment of sequences allows cross-species (or other taxonomic level, strain, taxa) comparison. An alignment is a hypothesis of positional homology between bases/amino acids of different sequences. A correct alignment is crucial for phylogenetic inference. Here we use ClustaW, a well-established pairwise sequence aligner.

First we modify the headers of the multi-fasta file, such that only the sample name is retained. This is important for future conatenation of alignment into a supermatrix (see Maximum likelihood GTN training)
