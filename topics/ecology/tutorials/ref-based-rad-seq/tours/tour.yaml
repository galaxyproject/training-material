      In the study of <a
      href="http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000862">Hohenlohe
      et al. 2010</a>, a genome scan of nucleotide diversity and differentiation
      in natural populations of threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus
      was conducted. Authors used Illumina-sequenced RAD tags to identify and
      type over 45,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each of 100
      individuals from two oceanic and three freshwater populations.

      We here proposed to re-analyze these data at least until the population
      genomics statistics calculation step using STACKS pipeline. Gasterosteus
      aculeatus draft genome will be used here as reference genome. In a
      reference-based RAD-seq data analysis, the reads are aligned (or mapped)
      against a reference genome to constrain our analysis to focus on already
      discovered loci. A de-novo approach can also be conducted (see <a
      href="http://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/de-novo-rad-seq/tutorial.html">de_novo
      tutorial</a>, enhancing discoverability of new loci of interest but also
      of false positive one).

    content: >-
      Note the quality drop at bases 5-10 which are the cut site of the RADSeq
      protocol (TGCAGG). This is caused by the extremely uneven distribution the
      sequencer observes TGCAGG in lockstep on all spots/clusters, i.e. all
      clusters light up at the same time. Therefore the sequencer can not be
      sure that each spot/cluster is correct which is expressed by the lower
      quality score. Usually PhiX is added to reduce this problem, but in the
      publication it is not stated if and to which extent this was done here.
      Still, approximately ~99% of the cases match nucleotide expected for the
      cut site sequence.<br><br> As there is a draft genome for <i>Gasterosteus
      aculeatus</i>, we can use this information and map the sequences on this
      genome to identify polymorphism.

  - title: Mapping
    content: >-
      To make sense of the reads, their positions within <i>Gasterosteus
      aculeatus</i> genome must be determined. This process is known as aligning
      or ‘mapping’ the reads to the reference genome. <br><br>Here we will use
      BWA. BWA is a fast light-weighted tool that aligns relatively short
      sequences (queries) to a sequence database (large), such as the human
      reference genome. It is developed by Heng Li at the Sanger Institute.

      In this tutorial, we have analyzed real RAD sequencing data to extract
      useful information, such as which loci are candidate regarding the genetic
      differentiation between freshwater and oceanic Stickelback populations. To
      answer these questions, we analyzed RAD sequence datasets using a
      reference-based RAD-seq data analysis approach.
