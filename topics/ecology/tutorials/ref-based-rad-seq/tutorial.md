# Introduction


In the study of [Hohenlohe *et al.* 2010](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000862), a genome scan of nucleotide diversity and differentiation in natural populations of threespine stickleback *Gasterosteus aculeatus* was conducted. Authors used Illumina-sequenced RAD tags to identify and type over 45,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each of 100 individuals from two oceanic and three freshwater populations.

![The abstract of the paper on Population Genomics](../../images/RAD4_Population_Genomics/Hohenlohe_et_al_2010.png)

We here proposed to re-analyze these data at least until the population genomics statistics calculation step using STACKS pipeline. *Gasterosteus aculeatus* draft genome will be used here as reference genome. In a reference-based RAD-seq data analysis, the reads are aligned (or mapped) against a reference genome to constrain our analysis to focus on already discovered loci. A de-novo approach can also be conducted (see [de_novo tutorial]({% link topics/ecology/tutorials/de-novo-rad-seq/tutorial.md %}), enhancing discoverability of new loci of interest but also of false positive one).

# Pretreatments

## Data upload

The original data is available at NCBI SRA ENA under accession number [SRR034310](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR034310) as part of the NCBI SRA ENA study accession number [SRP001747](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?study=SRP001747).

We will look at the first run SRR034310 out of seven which includes 16 samples from 2 populations, 8 from Bear Paw (freshwater) and 8 from Rabbit Slough (oceanic). We will download the reads directly from SRA and the remaining data (i.e reference genome, population map file, and barcodes file) from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1134547#.WkugUjfjJXI).

The sequences are raw sequences from the sequencing machine, without any pretreatments. They need to be demultiplexed. To do so, we can use the Process Radtags tool from STACKS.

## Demultiplexing reads

For demultiplexing, we use the Process Radtags tool from [STACKS](https://www.g3journal.org/content/1/3/171.full).

>    > >  2. 8139531 retained reads
>    > >  3. There are no sequences filtered because of low quality. This is because radtags didn't apply quality related filtering since the corresponding advanced option (Discard reads with low quality scores) has not been enabled. So here, all not retained sequences are removed because of an ambiguous barcode (626265) or an ambiguous RAD-Tag (129493). This means that some barcodes are not exactly what was specified on the barcode file and that sometimes, no SbfI restriction enzyme site was found. This can be due to some sequencing problems but here, this is also due to the addition, in the original sequencing library, of RAD-seq samples from another study. This strategy is often used to avoid having too much sequences beginning with the exact same nucleotide sequence which may cause Illumina related issues during sequencing and cluster analysis

> If like me you don't have payed attention to the organization of you file for the graphical representation you obtain a non optimal bars diagram with a not intelligent X-axis ordering. There is a lot of different manner to fix this. You can use a copy/paste "bidouille" or you can use Galaxy tools to manipulate the `radtags logs` file to generate a better graph. For example, you can use `Select lines that match an expression` tool to select rows then use the `Concatenate datasets tail-to-head` tool to reorganize these lines in a new file.

> 1. **Select lines that match an expression** applying `^R1.fq.gz` on the log files and then
> 2. **Replace Text in entire line** on the resulting data sets finding `R1.fq.gz` and replacing with `NoScoreLimit` or `Score10` or `Score20` depending of the case
> 3. **Select lines that match an expression** applying `File\tRetained Reads` on one of the log file to obtain you futur header
> 4. **Replace Text in entire line** on the resulting data set finding `File` and replacing with `#` to have a best display
> 5. **Concatenate datasets tail-to-head** on the resulting data sets stating from the header you just created
> 6. Finally **Convert delimiters to TAB** on the resulting data set converting all Tabs to be sure having a well formatted tabular file at the end
>
> Alternatively just copy/paste these lines on the Galaxy upload tool using Paste/fetch data section and modifying the File header by sample and filename by Score 10 / Score 20 and Lowquality for example... Before Starting the upload, you can select the `Convert spaces to tabs` option through the `Upload configuration` wheel. If you did not pay attention to the order you can just sort the file using the first column.

And you obtain a file like this one, ready to generate a beautiful and smart bar stacked!

```
#		Retained Reads	Low Quality	Ambiguous Barcodes	Ambiguous RAD-Tag	Total
NoScoreLimit	8139531		0		626265			129493			8895289
Score10		7373160		766371		626265			129493			8895289
Score20		2980543		5158988		626265			129493			8895289
```

You can use the `Charts` functionality through the Visualize button to plot the data.

![The chart on the sorted file](../../images/RAD4_Population_Genomics/Process_radtags_charts_end.PNG){: width="75%"}

You can further test using a filter like `clean data, remove any read with an uncalled base` and see that here, this has only little impact on the number of retained reads.

The demultiplexed sequences are raw sequences from the sequencing machine, without any pretreatments. They need to be controlled for their quality.

We propose to continue the tutorial using the dataset collection containing the demultiplexed reads obtained with Process Radtag execution made with a quality score of 10 and with the `Discard reads with low quality scores` parameter set to Yes (so containing 7373160 retained reads).

## Quality control

For quality control, we use similar tools as described in [NGS-QC tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.html): [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).

> <hands-on-title>Quality control</hands-on-title>

>    - *"Which tool was used generate logs?"*: `FastQC`
>    - *"Type of FastQC output?"*: `raw data`
>    - {% icon param-collection %} *"FASTQC output"*: the `raw data` output of FastQC (collection)
{: .hands_on}

![MultiQC output](../../images/RAD4_Population_Genomics/multiqc.PNG)

Note the quality drop at bases 5-10 which are the cut site of the RADSeq
protocol (TGCAGG). This is caused by the extremely uneven distribution the
sequencer observes TGCAGG in lockstep on all spots/clusters, i.e. all clusters
light up at the same time. Therefore the sequencer can not be sure that each
spot/cluster is correct which is expressed by the lower quality score. Usually, to reduce this problem,
PhiX is added, OR, as it is the case here, samples with heterogeneous barcodes lengths are mixed.
Still, approximately ~99% of the cases match nucleotide expected for the cut
site sequence.



As there is a draft genome for *Gasterosteus aculeatus*, we can use this information and map the sequences on this genome to identify polymorphism.

# Mapping

To make sense of the reads, their positions within *Gasterosteus aculeatus* genome must be determined. This process is known as aligning or 'mapping' the reads to the reference genome.

Here we will use BWA. BWA is a fast light-weighted tool that aligns relatively short sequences (queries) to a sequence database (large), such as the human reference genome. It is developed by Heng Li at the Sanger Institute.

*[Li et Durbin, Bioinformatics, 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19451168)*

>    - *"Use the following dataset as the reference sequence"*: `Reference_genome_11_chromosomes.fasta`
>    - *"Select input type"*: `Single Fastq`
>    - *"Select fastq dataset"*: One dataset collection containing the demultiplexed reads obtained with Process Radtag execution made with a quality score of 10 and with the `Discard reads with low quality scores` parameter set to Yes (so containing 7373160 retained reads).

{: .hands_on}

**BWA** generates BAM files with the mapped reads.

We next want to run Stacks on the freshwater and oceanic populations.

# SNP calling from radtags

Run `Stacks: Reference map` Galaxy tool. This program will run pstacks, cstacks, and sstacks using a perl scrip (ref_map.pl) on the members of the population, accounting for the alignments of each read.

# Conclusion


In this tutorial, we have analyzed real RAD sequencing data to extract useful information, such as which loci are candidate regarding the genetic differentiation between freshwater and oceanic Stickelback populations. To answer these questions, we analyzed RAD sequence datasets using a reference-based RAD-seq data analysis approach. This approach can be sum up with the following scheme:
