                <p>Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) can help understand a species distribution in relation to its environment. It can also attempt to quantify the impact of climate change on the species’ habitat, direct conservation efforts and predict invasive species distributions. This is acheived by associating species occurrence (observations) data with a set of environmental data (such as temperature and precipitation).</p>

<p>The goal of this tutorial is to model a theoretical ecological niche and predict species distribution in a future climate scenario by using an SDM with the Wallace interactive environment on Galaxy. We’ll use the data occurrences of <em>Chrysemys picta</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_turtle">Painted turtle</a>) in the US, North America region.</p>

<h2 id="process-occurrence-data">Process occurrence data</h2>

<p>For the modeling, we need to choose the occurrences we want to use. There is 4 ways to do this in Wallace in the <strong>2 Process Occ</strong> panel:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Selecting occurrences on the map by delimiting an interesting geographic area</li>
  <li>Removing occurrences by ID</li>
  <li>
    <p>Delimiting a spatial thin</p>

    <p>This allows selecting occurrences by setting a minimum distance (in km) between the different occurrences. For example, by typing 30km, we will get all the occurrences on the map which are at a minimum of 30km from each other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Considering all the occurrences</li>
</ol>

<p>We want to work on the data from the US, we will select the occurrences with the 1st option</p>

<h2 id="partition-occurrence-data">Partition Occurrence Data</h2>

<p>By partitioning data, a dataset is divided into subsets (i.e. bins). A model is built on each of the subsets but one, it is used to test the model (assuming that all the groups are independent).</p>

<p>There is 2 possible ways to partition data:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Non-spatial Partition</strong>: a partition used when there is no bias due to space, time or sampling method
    <ol>
      <li>Jacknife (k=n): each occurrence in the dataset is considered as equal to a bin. This is usually used when you have a small dataset with no known bias</li>
      <li>Random k-fold: partition the data randomly in a number of bins set by the user with the option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Number of Folds</code></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Spatial Partition</strong>: a partition used when there could be bias due to time, space or sampling method
    <ol>
      <li>Block (k=4): the area is divided in four and the different occurrences are put equally into four bins</li>
      <li>Checkerboard 1 (k=2): two bins are used according to the position of the occurrences on the grid</li>
      <li>
        <p>Checkerboard 2 (k=4): four bins are used according to the position of the occurrences on the grid. This requires an aggregation factor, which is the size of a second grid placed on the first one. For example, with a factor 4, the grid’s size will be 4x4</p>

        <figure id="figure-1" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/species-distribution-modeling/Checkerboard.png" alt="Checkerboard 2. " width="545" height="201" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/species-distribution-modeling/Checkerboard.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> Example of checkerboard (k=4) with a factor 4. Source: doi:10.0.4.87/2041-210X.12261</figcaption></figure>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>For both of these techniques the number of occurrences in each bin may vary.</p>

<h2 id="build-and-evaluate-niche-model">Build and Evaluate Niche Model</h2>

<p>Wallace can build different models using either:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The presence-only approach BIOCLIM (Module BIOCLIM) (<span class="citation"><a href="#booth2018">Booth 2018</a></span>)</li>
  <li>The presence-background (presence-pseudo absence) algorithm Maxent (Module Maxent)</li>
</ol>

<p>To evaluate these models, Wallace computes the performance on a hold-out dataset (data not used for training) and provides evaluation metrics such as the AUC (Area Under the Curve) mean. As a rule of thumb, an AUC of 0.75 and above is considered good, and closer to 1 is better.</p>

<p>The optimum environmental parameters for this species (represented in green) are between 5°C and 15°C (on the graph, values are x10) with an annual precipitation between approximately 700mm and 1250mm.</p>

<p>To visualize the suitability on the map, we can use the map prediction module.</p>

<p>We can predict not only for a different area, but also for a different time and climate. We use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_circulation_model#Atmospheric_and_oceanic_models">Global Circulation Models (GCM)</a> to predict atmospheric fluctuation and then evaluate climate change. Each model is different and uses several parameters such as ocean atmosphere. The prediction also uses RCP scenarios, Representative Concentration Pathways take average enegy requirements across the planet (2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 watts per meter squared) to model the concentration of greenhouse gases emitted in the near future and their effect on climate. These scenarios may produce varying predicted presence models.</p>

<p>We would like to predict the presence of <em>Chrysemys Picta</em> in Canada in 2050, given the model <a href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/ccsm4.0/">CCSM4</a>, a US model based on earth circulation, and an RCP value of 2.6 <!--(**TODO: what does that represent?**)--></p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Following this tutorial, we have loaded a dataset of occurrences to the shiny app Wallace and modeled the distribution of <em>Chrysemys picta</em> (Painted turtle) with the Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) method. This allowed us to visualize it’s ecological niche and how climate change can influence it’s future distribution in North America. The saved project can be used for similar future studies.</p>
