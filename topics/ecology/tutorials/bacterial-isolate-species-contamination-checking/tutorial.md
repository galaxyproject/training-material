Sequencing (determining of DNA/RNA nucleotide sequence) is used all over the world for all kinds of analysis. The product of these sequencers are reads, which are sequences of detected nucleotides. 

When sequencing bacterial isolates, it might be good to check if the expected species or strains can be identified in the data or if there is any contamination.

To illustrate the process, we take quality-controlled data of a bacterial genome (KUN1163 sample) from sequencing data produced in "Complete Genome Sequences of Eight Methicillin-Resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* Strains Isolated from Patients in Japan" ({% cite Hikichi_2019 %}). 

> Methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) is a major pathogen
> causing nosocomial infections, and the clinical manifestations of MRSA
> range from asymptomatic colonization of the nasal mucosa to soft tissue
> infection to fulminant invasive disease. Here, we report the complete
> genome sequences of eight MRSA strains isolated from patients in Japan.

# Galaxy and data preparation

Any analysis should get its own Galaxy history. So let's start by creating a new one and get the data (forward and reverse quality-controlled sequences) into it.

# Taxonomic profiling

To find out which microorganisms are present, we will compare the reads of the sample to a reference database, i.e. sequences of known microorganisms stored in a database, using **Kraken2** ({% cite wood2019improved %}).

{% snippet topics/microbiome/faqs/kraken.md %}

For this tutorial, we will use the PlusPF database which contains the Standard (archaea, bacteria, viral, plasmid, human, UniVec_Core), protozoa and fungi data.

> 1. {% tool [Kraken2](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/kraken2/kraken2/2.1.1+galaxy1) %} with the following parameters:
>    - *"Single or paired reads"*: `Paired`
>        - {% icon param-file %} *"Forward strand"*: `DRR187559_after_fastp_1`
>        - {% icon param-file %} *"Reverse strand"*: `DRR187559_after_fastp_2`

- **Classification**: tabular files with one line for each sequence classified by Kraken and 5 columns:

   1. `C`/`U`: a one letter indicating if the sequence classified or unclassified
   2. Sequence ID as in the input file
   3. NCBI taxonomy ID assigned to the sequence, or 0 if unclassified
   4. Length of sequence in bp (`read1|read2` for paired reads)
   5. A space-delimited list indicating the lowest common ancestor (LCA) mapping of each k-mer in the sequence     
      
      For example, `562:13 561:4 A:31 0:1 562:3` would indicate that:
      1. The first 13 k-mers mapped to taxonomy ID #562
      2. The next 4 k-mers mapped to taxonomy ID #561
      3. The next 31 k-mers contained an ambiguous nucleotide
      4. The next k-mer was not in the database
      5. The last 3 k-mers mapped to taxonomy ID #562     
      
      `|:|` indicates end of first read, start of second read for paired reads

- **Report**: tabular files with one line per taxon and 6 columns or fields

   1. Percentage of fragments covered by the clade rooted at this taxon
   2. Number of fragments covered by the clade rooted at this taxon
   3. Number of fragments assigned directly to this taxon
   4. A rank code, indicating

      - (F)amily

      - (S)pecies

      Taxa that are not at any of these 10 ranks have a rank code that is formed by using the rank code of the closest ancestor rank with a number indicating the distance from that rank. E.g., `G2` is a rank code indicating a taxon is between genus and species and the grandparent taxon is at the genus rank.

# Species extraction

In Kraken output, there are quite a lot of identified taxa with different levels. To extract the species level, we will use __Bracken__. 

__Bracken__ (Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance after Classification with Kraken) is a "simple and worthwile addition to Kraken for better abundance estimates" ({% cite Ye.2019 %}). Instead of only using proportions of classified reads, it takes a probabilistic approach to generate final abundance profiles. It works by re-distributing reads in the taxonomic tree: "Reads assigned to nodes above the species level are distributed down to the species nodes, while reads assigned at the strain level are re-distributed upward to their parent species" ({% cite Lu.2017 %}).

> <hands-on-title>Extract species with Bracken</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [Bracken](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/bracken/est_abundance/2.9+galaxy0) %} with the following parameters:

>     - *"Select a kmer distribution"*: `PlusPF`, same as for Kraken
>

>
>     - *"Level"*: `Species`

{: .hands_on}

**Bracken** generates one output as a table with 7 columns:

- Taxon name
- Taxonomy ID
- Level ID (S=Species, G=Genus, O=Order, F=Family, P=Phylum, K=Kingdom)
- Kraken assigned reads
- Added reads with abundance re-estimation
- Total reads after abundance re-estimation
- Fraction of total reads

As expected *Staphylococcus aureus* represents most of the reads in the data.

# Contamination identification

To explore **Kraken** report and specially to detect more reliably minority organisms or contamination, we will use **Recentrifuge** ({% cite marti2019recentrifuge %}).

> <hands-on-title> Identify contamination </hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [Recentrifuge](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/recentrifuge/recentrifuge/1.12.1+galaxy0) %} with the following parameters:

>    - *"Type of input file (Centrifuge, CLARK, Generic, Kraken, LMAT)"*: `Kraken`
>    - In *"Database type"*:
>        - *"Cached database whith taxa ID"*: latest
>    - In *"Output options"*:
>        - *"Type of extra output to be generated (default on CSV)"*: `TSV`
>        - *"Remove the log file"*: `Yes`
>    - In *" Fine tuning of algorithm parameters"*:
>        - *"Strain level instead of species as the resolution limit for the robust contamination removal algorithm; use with caution, this is an experimental feature"*: `Yes`
>
{: .hands_on}

**Recentrifuge** generates 3 outputs:
