The [ecology.usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu) (and any other Galaxy server ending in `usegalaxy.eu`) is the SAME server as the regular [usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu) server, just modified for Ecology analyses.

You can use the **SAME credentials** you used to register on usegalaxy.eu to log into the ecology server.

If you do not have an account on Galaxy EU yet, will need to create one.
