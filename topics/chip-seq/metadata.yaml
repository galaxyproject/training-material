    questions:
      - How is raw ChIP-seq data processed and analyzed?
      - What are the binding sites of Tal1?
      - Which genes are regulated by Tal1?
    objectives:
      - Inspect read quality with FastQC
      - Perform read trimming with Trimmomatic
      - Align trimmed reads with BWA
      - Assess quality and reproducibility of experiments
      - Identify Tal1 binding sites with MACS2
      - Determine unique/common Tal1 binding sites from G1E and Megakaryocytes
      - Identify unique/common Tal1 peaks occupying gene promoters
      - Visually inspect Tal1 peaks with Trackster

    time_estimation: "3h"
    key_points:
      - Sophisticated analysis of ChIP-seq data is possible using tools hosted by Galaxy.
      - Genomic dataset analyses require multiple methods of quality assessment to ensure that the data are appropriate for answering the biology question of interest.
      - By using the sharable and transparent Galaxy platform, data analyses can easily be shared and reproduced.
