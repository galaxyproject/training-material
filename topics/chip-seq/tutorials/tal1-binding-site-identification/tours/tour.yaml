      In this tutorial we will identify the binding sites of the T-cell acute
      lumphocytic leukemia protein 1 (TAL1), sing the data published by <a
      href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/24/12/1945.full.pdf+html">Wu et al.
      (2014)</a>. The goal of this study was to investigate “the dynamics of
      occupancy and the role in gene regulation of the transcription factor
      TAL1, a critical regulator of hematopoiesis, at multiple stages of
      hematopoietic differentiation.” <br>Identifying the proteins contained in
      a sample is an important step in any proteomic experiment. This tour deals
      with protein identification from peptides ("bottom-up proteomics"). <br>To
      this end, ChIP-seq experiments were performed in multiple mouse cell types
      including G1E - a GATA-null immortalized cell line derived from targeted
      disruption of GATA-1 in mouse embryonic stem cells - and megakaryocytes.

      This dataset (GEO Accession:<a
      href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE51338">GSE51338</a>)
      consists of biological replicate TAL1 ChIP-seq and input control
      experiments. Input control experiments are used to identify and remove
      sampling bias, for example open/accessible chromatin or GC bias.
      <br><br>Because of the long processing time for the large original files,
      we have downsampled the original raw data files to include only reads that
      align to chromosome 19 and a subset of interesting genomic loci identified
      by Wu et al. (2014).

      with high uncertainty (i.e. low-quality bases). In addition, artificial

      before attempting to align the reads to a reference genome.

  - title: Aligning reads to a reference genome
    content: >-
      To determine where DNA fragments originated from in the genome, the
      sequenced reads must be aligned to a reference genome. This is equivalent
      to solving a jigsaw puzzle, but unfortunately, not all pieces are unique.
      In principle, you could do a BLAST analysis to figure out where the
      sequenced pieces fit best in the known genome. Aligning millions of short
      sequences this way, however, can take a couple of weeks. Nowadays, there
      are many read alignment programs for sequenced DNA, BWA being one of them.
      You can read more about the BWA algorithm and tool <a

      It is critical to visualize NGS data on a genome browser after alignment

    content: >-
      In this exercise you imported raw Illumina sequencing data, evaluated the
      quality before and after you trimmed reads with low confidence scores,
      aligned the trimmed reads, identified TAL1 peaks relative to the negative
      control (background), and visualized the aligned reads and TAL1 peaks
      relative to gene structures and positions. Additional, you assessed the
      “goodness” of the experiments by looking at metrics such as GC bias and IP
      enrichment.
