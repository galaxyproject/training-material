# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

This tutorial uses ChIP-seq datasets from a study published by [*Wu et al.* (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4248312/). The goal of this study was to investigate "the dynamics of occupancy and the role in gene regulation of the transcription factor TAL1, a critical regulator of hematopoiesis, at multiple stages of hematopoietic differentiation."

To this end, ChIP-seq experiments were performed in multiple mouse cell types including G1E - a GATA-null immortalized cell line derived from targeted disruption of GATA-1 in mouse embryonic stem cells - and megakaryocytes.

This dataset (GEO Accession: [GSE51338](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE51338)) consists of biological replicate TAL1 ChIP-seq and input control experiments.
Input control experiments are used to identify and remove sampling bias, for example open/accessible chromatin or GC bias.

Because of the long processing time for the large original files, we have downsampled the original raw data files to include only reads that align to chromosome 19 and a subset of interesting genomic loci identified by *Wu et al.* (2014).

# Step 1: Quality control

As for any NGS data analysis, ChIP-seq data must be quality controlled before being aligned to a reference genome. For more detailed information on NGS quality control, check out the tutorial [here]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/sequence-analysis).

# Step 2: Trimming and clipping reads

It is often necessary to trim a sequenced read to remove bases sequenced with high uncertainty (*i.e.* low-quality bases). In addition, artificial adaptor sequences used in library preparation protocols need to be removed before attempting to align the reads to a reference genome.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Trimming and clipping reads
>
> 1. **Trimmomatic** {% icon tool %}: Run the tool **Trimmomatic** on each FASTQ file to trim low-quality bases (remember how to run tools on all files at once?). Explore the full parameter list for `Trimmomatic` in the Tool Form and set the following `Trimmomatic` parameters:
>
>    - **Paired end data?**: No
>    - **Perform initial ILLUMINACLIP?**: No
>    - **Select Trimmomatic operation to perform**: Sliding window trimming (SLIDINGWINDOW)
>    - **Number of bases to average across**: 4
>    - **Average quality required**: 20
>

# Step 3: Aligning reads to a reference genome

To determine where DNA fragments originated from in the genome, the sequenced reads must be aligned to a reference genome. This is equivalent to solving a jigsaw puzzle, but unfortunately, not all pieces are unique. In principle, you could do a BLAST analysis to figure out where the sequenced pieces fit best in the known genome. Aligning millions of short sequences this way, however, can take a couple of weeks.
Nowadays, there are many read alignment programs for sequenced DNA, `BWA` being one of them. You can read more about the BWA algorithm and tool [here](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btp324).

# Step 4: Assessing correlation between samples

To assess the similarity between the replicates sequencing datasets, it is a common technique to calculate the correlation of read counts for the different samples.

We expect that the replicate samples will cluster more closely to each other than to other samples. We will be use tools from the package **deepTools** for the next few steps. More information on **deepTools** can be found [here](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/list_of_tools.html).

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Assessing correlation between samples
>
> 1. **multiBamSummary** {% icon tool %}: Run the tool **multiBamSummary** from the **multiBamSummary** package
>
>    This tool splits the reference genome into bins of equal size and counts the number of reads in each bin from each sample. We set a small **Bin size** here because we are working with a subset of reads that align to only a fraction of the genome.
>
>    Set the following **multiBamSummary** parameters:
>

# Step 5: Assessing IP strength

We will now evaluate the quality of the immuno-precipitation step in the ChIP-seq protocol.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Assessing IP strength

# Step 6: Determining TAL1 binding sites

Now that **BWA** has aligned the reads to the genome, we will use the tool **MACS2** to identify regions of TAL1 occupancy, which are called "peaks". Peaks are determined from pileups of sequenced reads across the genome that correspond to where TAL1 binds.

**MACS2** will perform two tasks:

1. Identify regions of TAL1 occupancy (peaks)
2. Generate bedgraph files for visual inspection of the data on a genome browser.

More information about **MACS2** can be found [here](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2008-9-9-r137).

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Determining TAL1 binding sites
>
> 1. **MACS2 callpeak** {% icon tool %}: Run the tool **MACS2 callpeak** with the aligned read files from the previous step as Treatment (TAL1) and Control (input).
>
>    - Select replicate **ChIP-Seq Treatment Files** for one cell type
>    - Select replicate **ChIP-Seq Control Files** for the same cell type
>
>    ![macs2](../../images/MACS2_tool_form.png "Select the appropriate control and treatment files.")
>
> 2. Rename your files after **MACS2 callpeak** finishes to reflect the origin and contents.
{: .hands_on}

# Step 7: Inspection of peaks and aligned data

It is critical to visualize NGS data on a genome browser after alignment to evaluate the "goodness" of the analysis. Evaluation criteria will differ for various NGS experiment types, but for ChIP-seq data we want to ensure reads from a Treatment/IP sample are enriched at peaks and do not localize non-specifically (like the Control/input condition).

**MACS2** generates BEDgraph and BED files that we will use to visualize read abundance and peaks, respectively, at regions **MACS2** determines to be TAL1 peaks using Galaxy's in-house genome browser, **Trackster**.

## Step 7.1: Inspection of peaks and aligned data with Trackster

First, we will reformat the peak file before we send it to Trackster, and then we will import a gene annotation file so we can visualize aligned reads and TAL1 peaks relative to gene features and positions.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Inspection of peaks and aligned data with Trackster

## Step 7.2: Inspection of peaks and aligned data with IGV
We show here an alternative to Trackster, [IGV](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/).

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: IGV

# Step 8: Identifying unique and common TAL1 peaks between stages

We have processed ChIP-seq data from two stages of hematopoiesis and have lists of TAL1 occupied sites (peaks) in both cellular states. The next analysis step is to identify TAL1 peaks that are *shared* between the two cellular states and peaks that are *specific* to either cellular state.

# Step 9: Generating Input normalized coverage files

We will generate Input normalized coverage (bigwig) files for the ChIP samples, using **bamCompare** tool from **deepTools2**. **bamCompare** provides multiple options to compare the two files (e.g. log2ratio, subtraction). We will use log2 ratio of the ChIP samples over Input.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Generate Input-normalized bigwigs

> 3. Check that you are using log2 ratio to compare the samples, and click "Execute".
> 4. Repeat this step for all treatment and input samples: Megakaryocyte_Tal1_R1.bam and Megakaryocyte_Input_R1.bam; G1E_Tal1_R2.bam and G1E_Input_R2.bam; G1E_Tal1_R1.bam and G1E_Input_R1.bam.

# Step 10: Plot the signal on the peaks between samples

Plotting your region of interest will involve using two tools from the **deepTools** suite.
+ computeMatrix : Computes the signal on given regions, using the bigwig coverage files from different samples.
+ plotHeatmap : Plots heatMap of the signals using the computeMatrix output.

optionally, you can also use `plotProfile`to create a profile plot using to computeMatrix output.

## Assessing GC bias

A common problem of PCR-based protocols is the observation that GC-rich regions tend to be amplified more readily than GC-poor regions.

We will now check whether the samples have more reads from regions of the genome with high GC.

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

In this exercise you imported raw Illumina sequencing data, evaluated the quality before and after you trimmed reads with low confidence scores, aligned the trimmed reads, identified TAL1 peaks relative to the negative control (background), and visualized the aligned reads and TAL1 peaks relative to gene structures and positions. Additional, you assessed the "goodness" of the experiments by looking at metrics such as GC bias and IP enrichment.
