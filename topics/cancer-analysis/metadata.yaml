title: "Cancer Analysis"
summary: |
  A set of tutorials around cancer analysis. These tutorials are based on  the [Bioinformatics.ca Cancer Analysis course](https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops-all/2021-cancer-analysis/) and adapted for Galaxy.

  This 5-day workshop will cover the key bioinformatics concepts and tools required to analyze cancer genomic data sets and access and work with data sets in the Cloud.

  Participants will gain practical experience and skills to
    - Visualize genomic data;
    - Analyze cancer –omic data for gene expression, genome rearrangement, somatic mutations, and copy number variation;
    - Analyze and conduct pathway analysis on the resultant cancer gene list;
    - Integrate clinical data;
    - Launch, configure, customize, and scale virtual machines (VM);
    - Navigate and work with data sets from Cloud repositories; and
    - Follow best practices in data and workflow management.
