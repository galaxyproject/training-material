# Data Import

We will be working on a [CageKid](http://www.cng.fr/cagekid/) sample pair, patient `C0098`. The CageKid project is part of ICGC and is focused on renal cancer in many of itâ€™s forms. The raw data can be found on EGA and calls, RNA and DNA, can be found on the [ICGC](https://dcc.icgc.org/) portal.

For practical reasons we subsampled the reads from the sample because running the whole dataset would take way too much time and resources.
