1
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,700
great thanks so I'm to review I'm the

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,130
genomics director here at OU ACR and the

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,110
senior scientist

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,930
across the spider Cancer Center so my

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,189
role has always been right in the middle

6
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:20,689
of basic research and clinical

7
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:25,329
translation so my my lab and both

8
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,529
operation here oh I see are really right

9
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:29,300
at that interface where we try to take

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,980
research findings and put them at the

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,440
practice as possible I the other had I

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,090
where I'm a board-certified molecular

13
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,940
geneticist so really set it's like the

14
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,379
best kept secret in academic research

15
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:41,930
basically it's a career path for PhD

16
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,760
scientists to get poured certification

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,770
then essentially sign out I'm like the

18
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,860
pathology reports through through

19
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,600
pathology departments so I really would

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,530
I'm actually the fact that's on my CV

21
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,090
I'm actually a graduate also of the

22
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,770
canaima ranks or traps live so it took

23
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,960
the same program when I was a graduate

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,540
student at the BC Cancer Agency and that

25
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,610
skill set really held me well going

26
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,710
through especially the clinical genomics

27
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,869
world or really that skill set is really

28
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,530
an increasingly increasing need

29
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,360
especially to move from single genes to

30
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,610
Kochi from sequencing so that's sort of

31
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,520
a plug for that but certainly CBW really

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,890
got me started so my role in this

33
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,630
workshop is really to describe not

34
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,360
really the right down to the scripts and

35
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,770
codes and pipelines but really a

36
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,390
high-level overview of cancer genomics

37
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,280
and I've really tried to fill this talk

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,130
with as many data examples as possible

39
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,549
and links out to sort of landmark papers

40
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:39,409
in the fields really illustrate how does

41
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:40,909
the cancer genome go wrong and how we

42
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:42,680
use my informatics and computational

43
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,470
biology to measure and interpret it the

44
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,510
way the whole talk is set out is the

45
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,970
first 45 minutes to an hour is really a

46
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,860
little more didactic it's here's the

47
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,180
cancer genome here's what goes wrong

48
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,140
here's how we measure it's

49
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,229
computationally but the last 45 minutes

50
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,939
maybe 30 minutes is a case report

51
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:00,950
basically one of the first patients ever

52
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,470
to get whole genome when RNA sequencing

53
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,970
and how we went through at the Cancer

54
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,220
Agency at that time to interpret that

55
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,780
genome essentially manage that patient

56
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,069
over over a year and a half and so

57
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:14,360
that's the whole the learning objectives

58
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,730
of this module how is cancer genomes

59
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,500
different from healthy or normal genomes

60
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,780
how can we use bioinformatics

61
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,890
to define those differences what are the

62
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,480
many approaches you can tell there's

63
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,340
lots of ways lots of tools to do

64
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,830
things and bioinformatics so I'm really

65
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,690
not going to obsess over individual

66
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,250
tools that do certain things but really

67
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,769
the broad level concepts as to have

68
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:39,230
specific out specific algorithms are

69
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,390
useful for specific cancer types or

70
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,209
specific clinical questions and the last

71
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:45,680
part really that case report how do we

72
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,390
use genomics to understand or guide

73
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,239
patient care so any questions sort of on

74
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,000
that flyover overview background that

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,160
kind of thing happy to hear questions as

76
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,129
we as we go actually know several of you

77
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:01,329
in the audience oh that's good to see

78
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:04,430
so I really want to make a point we're

79
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,989
all made of cells and if you have a cell

80
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:08,239
it can become cancerous so really think

81
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,280
of cancer as starting from a single

82
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,400
healthy cell I'm asked all the time by

83
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,110
family like what about this cancer whoa

84
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,329
that cancer type there are really as

85
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:18,950
many cell types as there are there are

86
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,640
that many cancer types

87
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,890
genetically this is where really the you

88
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,450
can be very specific around types of

89
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,099
cancer and driver of cancer so I really

90
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:30,829
wanted to start the whole talk with what

91
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,239
does a normal genome look like this is

92
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,829
what one of my blood cells looks like if

93
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,269
you drop it on the glass slide at the

94
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:37,069
right point in the cell cycle you get

95
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:38,959
what is called a chromosome spread so

96
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,700
essentially these are all the

97
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,700
chromosomes from one cell and the

98
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,720
old-fashioned way

99
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,540
Kerra typing cytogenetics the the

100
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,310
clinical Enterprise the lab enterprise

101
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,650
is literally a scissors and glue to do a

102
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,900
paste up to take all these chromosomes

103
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,090
and line them up side by side purely

104
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,560
looking at the banding pattern so this

105
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,910
is what a paste up of that chromosome

106
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,889
look of the chromosome spread looks like

107
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:03,560
essentially looking for commonalities or

108
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,819
differences there shouldn't be any

109
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,650
necessarily in this normal blood cell

110
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,540
but the point of showing you this is to

111
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,730
compare and contrast this chromosome

112
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,880
this chromosome spread to cancer you can

113
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,709
tell by eye there are way too many

114
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:18,019
chromosomes here some chromosomes are

115
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,060
missing pieces if it problems an IP or

116
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,918
IP is missing here there's

117
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,169
translocations there's a huge list of

118
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:26,210
ways that the cancer genome can be

119
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,620
altered and you can see them even just

120
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,690
by eye looking yeah just the chromosomes

121
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,770
of course this is because it just

122
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,200
becomes more and more complicated as you

123
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,720
start to look at the essentially at the

124
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,090
base level resolution so hiding in here

125
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,280
are all the base pair changes mutations

126
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,740
other often

127
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,300
and alterations and the real challenge

128
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,039
especially with computational biologists

129
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:47,889
is not just making the list but also

130
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:52,240
linking that list to clinical actions so

131
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,039
this is a quote actually my previous

132
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:56,130
supervisor he loved this quote has it

133
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,449
pertained to cancer all happy families

134
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:00,580
or how all happy cells are like each

135
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,680
unhappy cell isn't happy in its own way

136
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,630
so really this idea of precision

137
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,190
medicine really came from the idea that

138
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,860
all the DNA in these cells can be

139
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,020
altered and different way they converge

140
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,949
on a relatively few relatively speaking

141
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:16,599
biological pathways but really the way

142
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:18,039
that those pathways are dysregulated

143
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:19,449
really is going to be unique to each

144
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:22,060
cell and each answer type and this is

145
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,560
essentially you always see a lot of

146
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,180
these this is a circo's diagram this is

147
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,979
another way to show chromosomes so in

148
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:28,900
this case instead of the sort of the

149
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,550
paint step I showed earlier all the

150
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,960
chromosomes are now ringed around the

151
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,509
outside and then what I've annotated he

152
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:36,400
actually might reverse see who runs the

153
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,650
software program that makes this these

154
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,900
types of plots is essentially annotated

155
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,580
in this inset all the different ways

156
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,979
that the cancer genome can be altered

157
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,479
mutations rearrangements of epigenetic

158
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,770
changes all the things you're going to

159
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,300
learn over the next week the other

160
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,370
aspect in cancer genomics is the

161
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,740
temporal aspect cancer genomes DNA cells

162
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,729
divide they change over time as a great

163
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:02,139
great review here by stratton and camera

164
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:03,280
stratton campbell and flu tree all

165
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,830
really showing how these mutations even

166
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,199
especially in pediatric cancers in fact

167
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,460
some of these kids are actually born

168
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,110
with cancer themselves in close not a

169
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,000
cancer diagnosis at some point they've

170
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,009
acquired these passenger mutations I

171
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:17,050
mean you can't in the case of adult

172
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,520
cancer it's essentially waiting for the

173
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,919
accumulation of mutations until you get

174
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:22,900
a mutation in the wrong spot in the

175
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,000
wrong cell at the wrong time those are

176
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,009
referred to as passenger mutation or

177
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:28,800
driver mutations rather so that's what's

178
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,960
listed here is as a star and then you

179
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,550
essentially see this again temporal

180
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,020
evolution acquisition of additional

181
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,190
somatic driver alterations

182
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,659
eventual diagnosis and even the active

183
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:41,740
treatment can actually introduce

184
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,990
additional mutations the most famous of

185
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,120
these team is all about brain cancer the

186
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,130
whole point of that treatment is to just

187
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,169
bombard the cancer genome with so many

188
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:52,210
mutations that those cells eventually

189
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,240
become unstable and die it actually does

190
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,429
not

191
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:59,110
extend life to a huge degree at least in

192
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,330
in brain cancer but it's one therapeutic

193
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,979
strategy and completely measuring

194
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:06,189
measurable using that music genomics so

195
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:07,240
just some key points on the slide

196
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,949
mutation frequency depends on cancer

197
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:10,990
type the pediatric cancers as they

198
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,759
haven't had the opportunity to pile up

199
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,589
these mutations are often the low

200
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:17,080
mutation rate tumors and the high

201
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,550
mutation rate tumors especially the ones

202
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,969
that have external environmental

203
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:24,009
exposure Sun and melanoma smoking and

204
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:25,179
lung cancer these are all the higher

205
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:27,459
mutation rate tumors and if you look at

206
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:29,349
those tumors about post team as Olamide

207
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:32,409
they're just peppered with hundreds of

208
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:34,059
thousands if not millions of mutations

209
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:39,580
in the most extreme case here's a plot

210
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,009
sort of the first date applause I really

211
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:43,779
have to talk really showing all this is

212
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:46,449
actually a great pan-cancer analysis by

213
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:48,639
GAD Getz his group led by Mike Mike

214
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,229
Lawrence at the Geno at the Broad

215
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:52,719
Institute in this case each dot and is

216
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:54,189
an individual cancer many of these

217
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:55,539
coming from the Cancer Genome Atlas

218
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:57,849
project but really to hammer home that

219
00:07:57,849 --> 00:07:59,619
point of low meat the way to read this

220
00:07:59,619 --> 00:08:02,740
re is y-axis and mutation rate x-axis is

221
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,839
cancer type the low mutaters and the

222
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:07,149
pediatric cancers down here the high

223
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:10,059
mutaters and the the environmentally

224
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:11,469
exposed cancers really on the other

225
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:13,749
extreme but the other important point on

226
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:15,219
this plot is really the huge dynamic

227
00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:17,259
range within an individual cancer types

228
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:19,269
well you can say in general pediatric

229
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:20,829
cancers have low mutation rates I

230
00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:22,599
circled this one here this neuroblastoma

231
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:24,249
this is actually from a project I worked

232
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:26,110
on as a postdoc this case very

233
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,610
interesting actually just as many meet

234
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,649
as mutations is a late stage lung cancer

235
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:32,139
and the reason for that was this is the

236
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:34,990
only neuroblastoma that had two

237
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,958
mutations mutation in each copy of mlh1

238
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,969
a DNA repair gene so it was really a

239
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:42,490
direct link between loss of the ability

240
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,069
of that cell to repair its DNA and just

241
00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:47,350
piling up with additional mutations it

242
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,970
looked the same if you look this at the

243
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,889
cells built at the chromosome it looked

244
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:52,329
like neuroblastoma but if you really

245
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:54,459
squat down to the base level resolution

246
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:56,500
you could see all these mutations and we

247
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,199
see a molecular cause for the opposite

248
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:01,750
story here here's melanoma very famous

249
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,720
for very high mutation rate these these

250
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,040
tumors actually respond very well to

251
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,930
drugs that reactivate the immune system

252
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,610
because they're lots

253
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,149
potential antigens to be recognized in

254
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:14,639
in these tumors this one down here he

255
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,139
actually has just as many mutations as

256
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,509
pediatric cancers very unusual in this

257
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:20,519
case is the actually the only melanoma

258
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,529
in the TCGA cohort that was not some

259
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,869
expose this was actually a tumor on the

260
00:09:24,869 --> 00:09:26,970
bottom of the patient's foot no sun

261
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,920
exposure whatsoever just extraordinarily

262
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,199
bad luck it was a driver mutation in a

263
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:33,329
melanocytes that resulted in bad cancer

264
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:34,799
and actually if you really squint you

265
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,449
can see here this sort of this the way

266
00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:37,889
to read this bottom is here all the

267
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:40,110
different types of mutations and there's

268
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,459
one that's actually quite different this

269
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,129
little blue sliver it does not have any

270
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:46,259
of the sun exposure signature like all

271
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:47,939
of the others all the yellow mutations

272
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:49,829
here essentially are induced by a UV

273
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:52,290
exposure he's really the outlier both in

274
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,939
mutation counts but also a mutation

275
00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:54,449
types

276
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:58,889
so really all hangs together another

277
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,839
famous slide just in general where these

278
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,029
mutations landing and general tumor

279
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:05,129
cells acquire abnormal activities and

280
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:06,779
you actually are they're not inventing

281
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,429
new abilities they're taking abilities

282
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:10,230
from other normal cells and turning them

283
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,939
on and cells where they shouldn't be

284
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:14,369
active so this is termed the hallmarks

285
00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:15,389
of cancer are not you're really gonna

286
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:17,069
believe or what these are but

287
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:18,839
essentially you can been a lot of these

288
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,029
driver processes into not that many

289
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:23,579
biological processes and essentially

290
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:26,009
pretty much every cancer type has

291
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:28,079
co-opted or undermine these molecular

292
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,689
processes almost always do so to a

293
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:31,949
somatic alteration

294
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:33,540
I presentation that rearranged from the

295
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,459
car never change or often the collection

296
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:40,619
of all of these all of these at once the

297
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:42,419
other goal and challenge certainly by

298
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:44,730
informatics is or question action often

299
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,769
catches like what is a driver mutation

300
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:48,299
how do you differentiate that from the

301
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,549
passenger mutation they the way this was

302
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,019
done classically during the Cancer

303
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,269
Genome Atlas project was to grind up in

304
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:57,629
sequence 500 of every single examples of

305
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:59,699
every single cancer type and look for

306
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:01,649
mutations that we saw over and over and

307
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:03,839
over so it actually turns out specifics

308
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,299
cell of origins all depend on different

309
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,569
academic or regular normal signaling

310
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,399
pathways and therefore they're getting

311
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,499
mutations that often clusters specific

312
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:15,989
in those pathways specifically so I'm

313
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:17,069
just showing here those oncogenic

314
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:18,629
mutations are essentially targeting a

315
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:20,429
core set of biological functions

316
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,470
relevant to that cell type and this

317
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,390
just an example like this is a great

318
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,160
textbook just in general Thompson and

319
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,170
Thompson this sort of the Bible

320
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,290
certainly for the medical genetics field

321
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,580
sort of filled with a lot of these types

322
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,740
of concepts in this case having this

323
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,990
idea of a single cell activating

324
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,910
oncogenes these are sort of like the gas

325
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,790
or for a car so to have you drive the

326
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,370
cell cycle or cell growth turning off

327
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,660
the brake so often these tumor

328
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,370
suppressor genes you know we have two

329
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,720
chromosomes just like I showed on the

330
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,150
earlier slide you need two mutations to

331
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,920
knock these out one from each from each

332
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,530
each copy and then additional

333
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,510
accumulation of mutations over time

334
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,030
again undermining or either turning on

335
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,740
or turning off normal biological

336
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,600
processes and this is actually still a

337
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,230
challenge

338
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,870
TCGA actually did a great job to define

339
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,120
the high frequency recurrent mutations

340
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,150
across all cancer types in TCGA but as

341
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,280
we continue to test now thousands or

342
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,500
tens of thousands of tumors or continue

343
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,920
to identify even more sort of more

344
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,510
infrequently mutated but still

345
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,820
biologically meaningful somatic

346
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,590
mutations across virtually all all

347
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:30,870
cancer types really the context of this

348
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,400
talk is really not just finding

349
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,960
mutations that how do we do something

350
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,310
about them so I've just showed two of

351
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,740
the most important examples here really

352
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,630
this concept of targeted therapies and

353
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,610
this is really a change round so at

354
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,910
early 2000s 2004 2004 really the

355
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,620
understanding that yes there are driver

356
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,780
mutations specifically in cancer but

357
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,670
also the idea that if we know there's a

358
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,470
pathway that's turned on abnormally

359
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,450
selecting a therapy that can then

360
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,760
inhibit or block activation of that

361
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,920
pathway so two examples here lung

362
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,980
adenocarcinoma with now essentially

363
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,200
standard of care activating mutations of

364
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,450
EGFR these mutations activate the

365
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,580
epidermal growth factor receptor pathway

366
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,800
the therapeutic strategy is pretty

367
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,260
obvious just block EGFR and block EGFR

368
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,630
signal signaling and this paper here

369
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,700
really showing very dramatic responses

370
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,730
to inhibited inhibition of EGFR but only

371
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,380
effective in patients with those

372
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,720
specific mutations same story here

373
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,210
missed at melanoma in this case is poor

374
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,060
patient really just filled with multiple

375
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,740
metastatic lesions and then very very

376
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,170
dramatic responses to BEMER and when

377
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,970
those tumors have b-raf

378
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,759
600d mutations the problem with this

379
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:41,100
approach have made it obvious there's a

380
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,629
lot of genomic complexity to these

381
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:47,639
tumors and this therapeutic strategy is

382
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:50,250
just saying one of potentially hundreds

383
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,740
of other other driver mutations or other

384
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,360
pathways active in these cells

385
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,389
so using these targeted therapies that

386
00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:00,720
the single mono therapy approach really

387
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,569
results inevitably in resistance there's

388
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:06,209
very very rarely that any of these M

389
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:08,459
single targeted agents result in cure

390
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,920
they certainly derive a very strong

391
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,870
survival benefit but really the paths

392
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,629
are made my opinion is that really the

393
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:17,610
need to identify multiple autogenic

394
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,620
pathways active at once and hit them

395
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,319
simultaneously or very close in time and

396
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:26,910
one piece of data that really support

397
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,720
that is this idea that tumors are almost

398
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,459
always or at least the majority of

399
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,680
tumors have mutations in multiple

400
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,139
targeted pathways so this is a big band

401
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,269
format it's exercise I'm published in

402
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:41,220
Nature Genetics going to read this plot

403
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,779
each column is a different cancer types

404
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,300
you'll get to know these little

405
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,470
four-letter codes or kind of the codes

406
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,589
that TCGA has used ethnic cancer kidney

407
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,589
cancer lung adenocarcinoma except etc so

408
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:54,420
that's how you read the columns each row

409
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,389
is a different driver driver mutation or

410
00:14:57,389 --> 00:14:59,250
tumor suppressor and the three main

411
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,680
points from this paper were the first

412
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,689
druggable alterations cut across cancer

413
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:05,970
types in this case fgfr3 mutations being

414
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,300
seen in multiple tumors b-raf mutations

415
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,430
are another good example they're often

416
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,319
actually the reason I like this figure

417
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:15,269
they've mapped all the genes to specific

418
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:17,250
oxygen at pathways so the second story

419
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,949
is it's very common within a cancer type

420
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:22,920
to have two or more pathways implicated

421
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,860
so in this case these two cancer types

422
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,019
first of all share mutations in two

423
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:30,269
pathways but also two pathways are also

424
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:32,250
being mutated in individual tumors and

425
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,649
point three at least half of tumors have

426
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:37,290
at least two disrupted immediately

427
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,350
actionable or immediately targetable Pat

428
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:45,630
druggable pathways the other challenge

429
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,130
and actually main reason for resistance

430
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,530
is I've talked so far about cancer

431
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,290
so there are tumors this is one

432
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,790
amorphous blob of cells and it's

433
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,260
definitely not that so tumors are

434
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,210
actually a colony or micro environment

435
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,220
of cells actually really well

436
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,590
illustrated here in this review showing

437
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,000
in this case you started with a single

438
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,210
cell but as those cells to buy new just

439
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:09,300
like we saw over time new occupations or

440
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,090
new alterations essentially occur in

441
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,620
daughter cells and then those daughter

442
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,780
cells give rise to additional sub clones

443
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,460
so in this cartoon there are actually

444
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,590
three sub clones active and this is

445
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,180
actually a major challenge for molecular

446
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,890
testing because you may have your driver

447
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,170
mutation EGFR BRF what have you over

448
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,360
here but it may be actually absent where

449
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,190
these cells may no longer be dependent

450
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,020
specifically on having those pathways

451
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,870
those pathways activated and this is

452
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,030
really where mono they'll one potential

453
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,070
model for Y mono therapies may not be

454
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,140
effective long term we may be effective

455
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,490
against a single clone here but

456
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,070
additional clones may actually expand in

457
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,810
some cases to actually fill the niche

458
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,940
that's been left back sub Club Y and we

459
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,890
know that was at the at the single cell

460
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,690
level because if you actually take a a

461
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,330
sweating probe and probe for large

462
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,910
deletions or copy number alterations you

463
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,010
can even see by eye specific cells some

464
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,570
have the gains some of them don't some

465
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,550
have deletions some of them don't and

466
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,810
this is really the challenge generally

467
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,880
in genomics had we met all the driver

468
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,130
mutations not just to tumors but also

469
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,900
just subclones and ultimately single

470
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,119
cells and technology is just now coming

471
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,760
online it's actually enabling this idea

472
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,410
of precision medicine that single-cell

473
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,650
resolution essentially looking at the

474
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,010
DNA of its out of cells individually so

475
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,660
I foresee probably a single-cell

476
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,220
genomics workshop if there isn't one

477
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,020
already I'm sort of being in the works

478
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,190
in the next couple of years

479
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,520
I here's sort of a conceptual diagram of

480
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,020
what that can look like over time so a

481
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,080
single cell here driven by driver

482
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,110
mutations and loss of tumor suppressors

483
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,850
relatively short list here the expansion

484
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,160
of that highly heterogeneous mass to

485
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,330
hear all the different sub clonal

486
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,700
populations some share mutations so this

487
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,830
clone actually has two yellow they arose

488
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,140
from a single clone then you have a sub

489
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,330
clone of a sub clone and so on in this

490
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,530
case patient treated with chemotherapy

491
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,750
did a very good job debunking the tumor

492
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,420
in general so completely killed off

493
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,940
purple subclone but unfortunately great

494
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,400
Orange surviving and really the idea

495
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,020
especially upon relapse what are the

496
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,610
remaining drivers one of the features of

497
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,800
the relapse disease and how can you hit

498
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,450
that with a second targeted or

499
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,580
combination therapy and in this case

500
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,400
here this patient ultimately relapse

501
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,380
multiple new driver mutations unique to

502
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,180
a totally new clone that actually was

503
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,180
not even apparent at diagnosis I just

504
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,400
illustrates a few reasons and are a few

505
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,060
concepts one the power of longitudinal

506
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,760
sampling of these tumors over time and

507
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,880
often the disconnect between the

508
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,140
diagnostic sample and what you actually

509
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,970
see it relapse or really the need to

510
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,700
have access to tumor material or in some

511
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,280
cases cell-free DNA as close to the time

512
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,630
of clinical decision as possible here's

513
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,690
another example Peter Campbell again

514
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,430
looking at multiple metastatic tumors

515
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,930
from the same patient and really showing

516
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,720
how essentially a tumor can move around

517
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,330
the body and as it metastasizes then

518
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,340
founding its own micro environment with

519
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,040
its own clonal sub or its own subclonal

520
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,290
structure so idea of the primary tumor

521
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,840
metastasis hopping out here additional

522
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,420
sub clones metastasis seeding additional

523
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,830
who metastases and actually some really

524
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,480
nice work from scratch ah where he

525
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,330
showed even these tertiary metastases

526
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,340
can go back and reseed the other mad at

527
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,490
man metastatic site so really some great

528
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,350
molecular complexity all of it measured

529
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,810
and potentially actionable depending on

530
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,160
the types of mutations that were

531
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,690
encountering within these sub clubs so

532
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,250
you sort the list why would we do

533
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,930
molecular testing for cancer I've talked

534
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,280
a lot about targeted therapies and

535
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,660
treatments understand the drivers

536
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,440
understand the pathways implicated

537
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,400
measuring of drug resistance especially

538
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,410
in the mono therapy case when do we see

539
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,120
resistance have you direct a patient

540
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,070
towards a different targeted therapeutic

541
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,960
strategy I'm not going to talk a lot

542
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,820
about this but certainly in the germline

543
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,890
space inherited cancer syndromes these

544
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,410
are patients who are born with a cancer

545
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,090
predisposition variant and out

546
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,830
essentially waiting for loss of that

547
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,500
remaining allele and prognosis here's

548
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,440
the cancer type is it high-risk or not

549
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,180
is it a cancer venom primary can

550
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,150
molecular testing help refine specific

551
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,230
cell of origin for unusual cancers

552
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,059
so let's sort the general overview does

553
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:18,649
anyone have any questions about the

554
00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:20,539
reasons for like you're testing genomics

555
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:24,679
in general okay seeing none so I'm gonna

556
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:36,200
really push into camera yeah so Romans

557
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,049
comment so as we can find mutations how

558
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:40,100
do we show that there's actually

559
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,539
interaction or I guess even interested

560
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:44,570
interdependence II this is really the

561
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,309
boom now it's really being able to link

562
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:48,110
a genomic readout to a functional

563
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,909
genomic readout because I would argue

564
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:52,010
certainly in clinical lab testing no

565
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,340
it's fine a mutation reported back this

566
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,929
is really where I think research has to

567
00:20:56,929 --> 00:20:58,309
happen now is how do you model

568
00:20:58,309 --> 00:20:59,960
especially multiple mutations or

569
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,059
multiple pathways active in single

570
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:03,799
tumors and then how do you come up with

571
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,690
therapeutic strategies against those I

572
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,460
mean I think there's a few bad from

573
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,309
Attucks algorithms that do that but to

574
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:12,080
me you essentially need a lab experiment

575
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,940
to show that yes these two axes are

576
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,250
critical one experiment we're doing with

577
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,990
Peter Dirk's now view sequence

578
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,570
cell lines in a dish define the clones

579
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,760
using single cell sequencing and then

580
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,679
predict drugs that will work on Multan

581
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:26,299
one clone but not the other

582
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:28,279
so we'll try a drug a will try to drug B

583
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:30,710
I'll try a plus B and see if it kills

584
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,049
everything that's still super research

585
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:34,730
isn't certainly not clinical grade but

586
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,450
it's one conceptual way to take

587
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,889
measurement of somatic mutation and

588
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:42,320
mapping that to function but yeah it's a

589
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:49,519
lab experiment yeah okay so I'm now

590
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:51,830
gonna move more from the fly over here

591
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,630
as the landscape of all cancers now to

592
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,610
the individual patient level so the

593
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,519
patient it really doesn't matter as I've

594
00:21:58,519 --> 00:21:59,659
showed in that neuroblastoma and

595
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:02,659
melanoma example it's great to know this

596
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:05,210
type of meat of cancer has high or low

597
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,850
mutation but really the question for an

598
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,019
individual patients is one of the

599
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:11,330
targets in my cancer is but this

600
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,340
specific end of one tumor high mutation

601
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,559
low the said mutations are the

602
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:18,019
predisposing polymorphisms what is the

603
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:19,940
copy number landscape for an individual

604
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,909
person our viruses or bacteria involved

605
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:24,860
and what can be done about them so

606
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,860
really the point is always make a list

607
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,710
but also in

608
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,360
for what that list actually means just

609
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,490
running the pipeline is really just not

610
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,760
is not the endpoint so I'm gonna talk a

611
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,720
little bit about next-generation

612
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,490
sequencing this is essentially the

613
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,250
machine that we use to measure cancer

614
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,279
genomes currently the workflow is I've

615
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,590
just broken into four steps take a tumor

616
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:49,620
you extract DNA and RNA make a library a

617
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,149
library is essentially DNA that's

618
00:22:51,149 --> 00:22:53,850
compatible to reading on a dmx device

619
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,380
which is the next-generation sequencer

620
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,299
so essentially you take the DNA or the

621
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:00,480
RNA put these little synthetic adapters

622
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,340
on that essentially makes them readable

623
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,620
by Illumina sequencing device and then

624
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,149
computational analysis which is

625
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:10,320
essentially tailored to either the

626
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,789
clinical or the scientific the

627
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:14,370
scientific question so I just showed

628
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,960
some data examples this is what comes

629
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,880
off an Illumina sequencer it's literally

630
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,029
just the text document you can open it

631
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:23,630
notepad if you want to every row is a

632
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:28,289
don't but you can each row is a is a

633
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:30,990
read a C's T's and G's I've just shown

634
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,529
25 here on a 2500 which is now a

635
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:36,539
increasingly obsolete machine one-lane

636
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:39,120
generates 600 million of these reads so

637
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,520
you get massive numbers of reads this is

638
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,740
not meant to be human readable of course

639
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,659
you need computational analysis to make

640
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:49,289
sense of just the raw reads so I'm sure

641
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:50,970
you've heard this concept of a pipeline

642
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,770
at essentially this idea that takes that

643
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,320
raw data and transforms it into a an

644
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,020
output with meaning the idea here at

645
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,640
least for us is to take that raw DNA

646
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,549
sequence in run it through a series of

647
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:04,620
pieces of software and really step one

648
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,770
is that list of variation pipelines

649
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,600
actually pretty good analogy all the

650
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,070
pieces have to fit together perfectly

651
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,279
without leaks they're relatively modular

652
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:16,590
so really the idea of taking reads

653
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,779
comparing them to the genome that may

654
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:21,240
result in a new data file that data file

655
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,679
can now be read by a variant caller

656
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,750
those variants can now be read by a

657
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,850
variant phil trader essentially this

658
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,770
idea of software being interoperable

659
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:31,200
really around file formats and data

660
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,929
standards the generic pipeline at least

661
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:36,899
for DNA genomics is alignment take you

662
00:24:36,899 --> 00:24:38,399
of the reads I just showed you compare

663
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:40,740
them to the human genome reference how

664
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,480
do you QC or how do you

665
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,820
rather tidy up that alignment we use

666
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,230
liners they're very fast and sometimes

667
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,150
they make very minor mistake so step two

668
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,490
fixes that somewhat step three how do

669
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,250
you essentially assess the quality of

670
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,290
those alignments is your sample any good

671
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,000
your druvan quit DNA in does it look

672
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,760
like RNA is it human if you put human in

673
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,470
keep see is very very important

674
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,780
calling variants I put these four in

675
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,370
black because they're more or less

676
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,220
automated they're here at OIC our last

677
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,140
two steps are really not they're really

678
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,850
sort of the enterprise of computational

679
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:14,010
biology and the act of very

680
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,169
interpretation these really still need

681
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:19,290
humans to go through read by rebuild by

682
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:21,240
read variant by variant to really make

683
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,480
sense of an individual case and we'll go

684
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,410
through all of these during right talk

685
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,240
I'm so by far the most famous and widely

686
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,730
used pipeline is the genome analysis

687
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,890
toolkit SATs is the piece software

688
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,110
actually analysis framework from the

689
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,419
Broad Institute essentially the idea of

690
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:42,650
moving from raw reads moving through

691
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:45,210
essentially AI alignment to a comparison

692
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,340
to the human genome reference that QC

693
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,720
step I talked about their sort of

694
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,120
realigning around hard to align regions

695
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,820
fixing some of the quality of the bases

696
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,100
that came off the the sequencer running

697
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,320
variants and essentially doing

698
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,120
interpretation at the end they only

699
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,890
change really to this slide is I've just

700
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,840
put up some of the the tools we use for

701
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,299
cancer so gatk was actually built more

702
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:08,250
for germline analysis and now of course

703
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,320
been used by the cancer community as

704
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,780
well the reason we need cancer specific

705
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,840
tools is because of the types of site of

706
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,850
genetic events that we know happening

707
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,130
cancer we can't guarantee that cancer

708
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,110
have two copies of every chromosome so I

709
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,130
just showed you at the beginning that

710
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,480
doesn't happen they've got all their

711
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,250
genomes all the time you get these

712
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,260
awkward like three ployed you double and

713
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,910
then you lose a chromosome we need

714
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,290
collars that know that that can happen

715
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,540
they have a challenge with tumors is

716
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,120
they're not 100% cancer cells are always

717
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,360
a mixture of cancer cells and stromal

718
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,700
blood vessels immune cells we need

719
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,290
colors that know whether that can happen

720
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,360
you can't assume that half of your reads

721
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,040
will always have a variant than half the

722
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,080
reads always won't unique cancer where

723
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,820
or algorithms and this is really where

724
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,130
cancer bioinformatics or diverges from

725
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,380
conventional I guess I'd call it

726
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,620
germline

727
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:06,720
so step one is to take that yes yes

728
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,660
especially as your camels increase in

729
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,280
size as you look at more and more genes

730
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,470
it's essentially mandatory so anything

731
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,780
excellent above I would say always a

732
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,500
paired normal even four panels to the

733
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,590
500 genes we always run into a variant

734
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,630
that looks interesting but if we

735
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,070
sequence the normal that happens to be

736
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,010
there so yeah it's really worth the cost

737
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,320
if only in everyone's salaries trying to

738
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,750
figure out weird and rare variants to

739
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,340
just sequence the normal and settle this

740
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,610
as a question maybe a five gene panel I

741
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,140
could probably buy informatica Lee go

742
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,630
through five genes manually but yes I

743
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,490
really definitely encourage to build

744
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,200
that into your grants and budgets

745
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,640
sequence the normal so here's what step

746
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,960
one looks like it's actually the same

747
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,790
data I showed on the earlier slide just

748
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,990
aligned to the human genome reference

749
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,300
this is a piece of software I use pretty

750
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,460
much every day to look at

751
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,290
next-generation sequencing reads so the

752
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,700
way to use it here's the chromosome

753
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,770
along the top here's the region I've

754
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,120
zoomed into so I've zoomed in

755
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,550
extraordinary extraordinarily close just

756
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,400
in 292 basis here's the coverage this is

757
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,620
a histogram of how many reads align to

758
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,450
the next track which is the human genome

759
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,940
reference you can literally just

760
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,760
download this off the internet I usually

761
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,740
go to the UCSC genome browser there's

762
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,750
literally a link download the reference

763
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,480
so many three or four gigs it's not too

764
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,050
large and in gray are all of my reads so

765
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,550
essentially the question for cancer

766
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,530
genomics is how do our reads differ from

767
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,600
the reference and how they DIF differ

768
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,850
from match normal I've intentionally

769
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,410
chose in this case because there

770
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,700
shouldn't be any variation in this

771
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,520
region I think there are one or two

772
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,960
sharp-eyed students found one years ago

773
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,820
it's almost always the sequencing

774
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,410
artifact especially in sort of a sea of

775
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,270
non variation but there's there are some

776
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:55,350
technical questions really around what

777
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,970
does the sequencing artifact versus what

778
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,040
is it extraordinarily rare point

779
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,170
mutation I'm not going to go into that

780
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:05,460
too much in this talk and the other the

781
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,950
other quirk is there are many many many

782
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,850
ways to make

783
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,009
this slide there's a whole Wikipedia

784
00:29:11,009 --> 00:29:12,419
article for short retold sequence

785
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,539
alignment on this slide we use bwa it's

786
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:17,429
like far the most widely used because

787
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:20,309
extraordinarily fast for its for the

788
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:22,019
quality of the alignment so there are

789
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:23,490
lots of other tools some of them pay for

790
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,559
you some of them not as it's probably

791
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,630
more than 50 now but there are lots of

792
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,009
ways to essentially transform your data

793
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:31,649
from raw which is past cue that's the

794
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:33,990
file format we use at least for data

795
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,840
coming off the Illumina sequencer and

796
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,070
transforming that into a BAM file which

797
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,639
is essentially a binary alignment file

798
00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:44,309
and the nice thing about this i GV

799
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:46,379
software is if you have an in BAM format

800
00:29:46,379 --> 00:29:48,389
essentially it will let you read and

801
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:53,370
look around at these at these reads this

802
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,720
is actually a cartoon of what I just

803
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,039
showed you so it's the same sort of

804
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,480
layout the reference genome is here

805
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,860
along the top so in this case to

806
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,750
reference chromosomes chromosome 1

807
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,059
chromosome 5 here all the reads I just

808
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:04,950
showed you this review is actually

809
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:07,320
really aged really well this is

810
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,759
basically the same types of cancer

811
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:11,129
genome variation that we still look at

812
00:30:11,129 --> 00:30:12,809
to this day in this case looking for

813
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:14,220
reads that have a difference so in this

814
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,750
case a bunch of C's where there should

815
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,000
be an A those are point mutations in

816
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,100
bills very very small stretches

817
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,379
I think the formal definition now is up

818
00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:24,059
to 50 base pair so a deletion or

819
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:26,820
insertion very very small a very very

820
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,129
small portion of DNA contrast at the

821
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:32,279
very very large deletion so sort of

822
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:33,779
things that you could have seen said in

823
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:35,490
genetically we actually infer that as

824
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,529
missing data so if you try to sequence a

825
00:30:37,529 --> 00:30:39,720
region and your cell just doesn't have

826
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,399
that DNA it's leads to lead to that

827
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:42,929
chromosome that actually comes through

828
00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:45,330
in the data as Lac in this case if you

829
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,039
have half as much data in that region as

830
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,990
you expect so sorry this is a to copy

831
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,029
deletion this is a one-of to copy

832
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:52,740
deletion so a single copy deletion you

833
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,480
have half as much data as you'd expect

834
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,159
if you have a copy number gain you have

835
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,139
more chromosomes than say a normal

836
00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:00,960
diploid cell we see that as additional

837
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,970
number of reads we infer that as a gain

838
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,919
and translocation break point this is

839
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:07,470
where one end of the DNA fragment is

840
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,389
aligned to one chromosome and if you

841
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:10,620
sequence the other end of that DNA

842
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,120
fragment it aligns to a totally

843
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,529
different problem so this is actually

844
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:15,210
where there's been a breakage of

845
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:17,279
chromosomes the cells tried to repair it

846
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,289
yeah incorrectly put two chromosomes

847
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:21,460
together this often put two

848
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,520
often drive often put a driver gene next

849
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,320
under the control of an inappropriate

850
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,240
regulatory element so it's very powerful

851
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,140
way to up regulate or turn on a driver

852
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,570
mutation and since its DNA if you're

853
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,220
doing agnostic sequencing you just brand

854
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,830
up cells and sequence them that DNA or

855
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,750
RNA actually comes through as well so if

856
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,400
your tumor happens to be associated with

857
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,430
a virus EBV HPV that DNA sequence of

858
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,260
course comes through you needed a

859
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,150
special algorithm to take those reads in

860
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,500
line not just against the human

861
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,420
reference but against other non-human

862
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:57,910
references as well and here's sort of

863
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,610
this is more for test purposes or I

864
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,020
don't think it's part of this workshop

865
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,400
has really here the different waves

866
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,460
we've thought about whole genome secret

867
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,620
in sequencing a whole genome sequencing

868
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,570
no selection at all just take all the

869
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,390
material from a cell sequence it whole

870
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,070
exome sequencing this is essentially a

871
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,260
laboratory protocol modification where

872
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,270
you just use hybrid selection lab

873
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,770
protocol to essentially pull out only

874
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,110
the protein coding genes these are only

875
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,490
one percent of the whole human genome

876
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,780
but they are the part of the human

877
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,820
genome that encode proteins and there's

878
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,680
certainly the most well-studied so in

879
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,720
terms of linking anything to action

880
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,520
almost everything can be captured by a

881
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,500
whole exome sequencing that's becoming

882
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,720
less true now as regulatory elements and

883
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,720
right back regulatory mutations are

884
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,000
being discovered but today right the

885
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,040
second whole exome sequencing captures a

886
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,330
lot of that actionability

887
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,340
targeted gene sequencing this is more

888
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,380
done for cost so really narrowing in

889
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,150
specifically on genes that get you onto

890
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,190
a clinical trial or are very high

891
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,800
frequency sites of mutation target

892
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,780
aberrant gene typing even more specific

893
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,280
so we're only looking at one single

894
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,140
mutation if you're really only cared

895
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,820
about one site there's no need to

896
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,140
sequence the whole genome just sequence

897
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,300
that one spot and epigenome

898
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,190
modifications is actually a type of

899
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,800
change to DNA mold same as this time at

900
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,420
the cytosines essentially that's

901
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,460
invisible to conventional sequencing so

902
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,290
you have to do a chemical treatment of

903
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:20,050
the DNA to essentially unmask or mark

904
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:22,740
specific regions that have this this

905
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,230
epigenomic modification RNA sequencing

906
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,880
it's conceptually the exact same thing

907
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,350
very similar pathway to what I just

908
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,600
showed instead of extracting DNA from

909
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,570
cells retract RNA instead and run it

910
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:34,770
through

911
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,660
very similar pipeline in that case we're

912
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,150
not as interested the we're not as

913
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,830
interested necessarily in mutations but

914
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,020
we are interested in Quantico

915
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,120
if a cell is expressing genes at very

916
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,040
very high level we get many many reads

917
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,230
we infer that is highly expressed same

918
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,310
sort of thing if a gene is not expressed

919
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:53,280
we shouldn't see any reads from from

920
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,200
from those genes I'm not going to talk

921
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,570
about at all protein this is really

922
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,280
going to be a more or less a DNA or RNA

923
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,770
talk but this sort of field is really

924
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,740
starting to rise certainly even in the

925
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,690
the clinical profiling world especially

926
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:09,389
as it intersects with you know DNA

927
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:12,330
sequencing and RNA sequencing so I'm

928
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,460
gonna focus mostly on DNA and RNA I want

929
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,350
to show you some real data this is the

930
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,540
same sample using three strategies whole

931
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,460
genome sequencing exome sequencing RNA

932
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,770
sequencing this is an IG be screen shot

933
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,270
just like I showed you earlier but this

934
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,070
time we're zoomed way out instead of 90

935
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,659
two base pairs we're looking at 49

936
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:29,668
thousand base pairs you can see a whole

937
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:30,899
genome sequencing we have coverage

938
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:32,610
across essentially this entire region

939
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,760
and this 49,000 base pairs essentially

940
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,949
corresponds to the single K rash genes

941
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:40,590
very famous cancer gene a lot of hot

942
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,840
spot meet a very well understood hotspot

943
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,969
mutation specifically in k rats in this

944
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:46,320
case you can see whole genome sequencing

945
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,960
nice relatively even coverage across the

946
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,570
entire gene exome sequencing there's

947
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,370
that laboratory modification so you only

948
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,530
get reads on exons so you can see down

949
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:57,030
here here the regions that encode

950
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,580
protein and you only get read so you're

951
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,380
completely blind to what's happening on

952
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,420
the intranet sequences may be

953
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,740
interesting regulatory element

954
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,380
structural changes all sorts of things

955
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,610
you're not going to see them by exome

956
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,530
sequencing and RNA sequencing you let

957
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,240
the cell do the work cells the ones

958
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,430
splicing out the introns so again you

959
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,230
don't actually get reads happening

960
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,720
within the intronic sequences wait you

961
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,250
do get are these relationships between

962
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,660
exons this is actually very powerful

963
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,220
because you can actually see where every

964
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,350
it starts in one exon and begins in

965
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,790
another so if the next one is not being

966
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,920
used or it's being used in the abnormal

967
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,870
way RNA sequencing will actually you

968
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:34,760
look at the structure of how that RNA is

969
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:39,000
I'm sure you've heard the term whole

970
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,970
genome and whole exome sequencing it's

971
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,490
not whole does not mean 100% this is

972
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,260
actually a figure from page five paper I

973
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,300
worked on this postdoc our

974
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,720
really - this is actually a set of two

975
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,420
hundred and forty odd neuroblastomas the

976
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,550
way to read this plot each tiny tiny

977
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,160
slice here is a sample the color is our

978
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,410
ability to find mutations so one means

979
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,650
great coverage we're very well powered

980
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,930
to find mutations but down in black or

981
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,090
achievement at 50% essentially the

982
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,070
coverage is relatively low or just ain't

983
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,590
able to confidently map reads to those

984
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,050
two specific regions of the genome so

985
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,730
you can see by far most of the xon

986
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,410
genome is white we're pretty good at

987
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,030
calling mutations but there's sort of

988
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,860
this band down here where that ability

989
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,930
to call mutation breaks down either due

990
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:27,390
to problems and mapping reads to the

991
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,970
whole genome most frequently actually in

992
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,590
this project there were large-scale

993
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,570
deletions so that's actually resulted in

994
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,790
no coverage in those regions therefore

995
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,590
had low coverage so it wasn't

996
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,030
necessarily a problem with whole genome

997
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,680
sequencing was actually a feature of the

998
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,720
cancer genome you can't sequence DNA

999
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,610
that's not necessarily there but there

1000
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,020
was through this band in black but

1001
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,370
basically we could never find mutations

1002
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,100
in any samples and why even using a

1003
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,530
relatively G deep genomes at the time we

1004
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,420
still had this inaccessible portion of

1005
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,120
the genome and these are still

1006
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,320
challenging to sequence with short read

1007
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,420
sequencing technologies today these are

1008
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,190
repetitive regions the telomeres

1009
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,460
centromeres regions of the genome that

1010
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,990
have been duplicated so we just can't

1011
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,180
tell whether read goes to the original

1012
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,950
copy or to a duplicated part of the

1013
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,380
genome there are long read technologies

1014
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,720
that that do allow you to access this

1015
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,130
region of the genome there's new phase

1016
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,550
link technologies but really hole does

1017
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:29,730
not mean not 2% frenzies yeah so exome

1018
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,710
is depending on the company you buy the

1019
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:35,280
baits from will change so yeah I try not

1020
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,320
to use a whole too often it sort of

1021
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,580
entered the lexicon

1022
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,760
but yeah hold is really not a hundred

1023
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,500
percent the definition of the exon will

1024
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,060
actually change depending on who

1025
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,700
designed the bait set is it one

1026
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,650
reference transcript is that every ISO

1027
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,360
firm we've ever seen associated with

1028
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,760
those genes is that the exome including

1029
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,310
utrs or not especially as Brown

1030
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,690
petitions this is extraordinarily

1031
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,460
important to know especially as you

1032
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,770
start to take data from multiple sources

1033
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:03,420
many of which will abuse different

1034
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,970
designs of the XL both over time so

1035
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,490
newer newer exo-m's will include jeans

1036
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,200
that may not have even been discovered

1037
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,500
from on the earlier bait sets and the

1038
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,340
exomes have also been overly annotated

1039
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,410
over time sir was there are some exons

1040
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:21,240
that are absolutely huge you make a

1041
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,800
basis and actually the later versions

1042
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,630
even from the same company I have now

1043
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,550
shrank down to seventy or sixth mega

1044
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,619
bases so it's really very important to

1045
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:30,900
understand especially when you get an

1046
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,840
exome data is how did they define the

1047
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,570
excel because they're not in general the

1048
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:37,860
genes are highly over laughing but

1049
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,270
they're not a hundred percent consistent

1050
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:42,590
and certainly not the same over time

1051
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,490
yeah so sorry yeah yeah so Bates in this

1052
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,740
case the way most excellent sequencing

1053
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,780
is done is essentially you have a

1054
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,880
synthetic piece of DNA based on human

1055
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,770
genome reference you tether it to

1056
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,350
magnetic bead and essentially use a

1057
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:01,170
magnet to only pull out DNA that that's

1058
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:04,830
tipped that bait and since it's

1059
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,090
synthetic you can design that to be

1060
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,740
whatever you want and that is the reason

1061
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,359
for the change in the design of the

1062
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,960
Excel yeah so you may hear a few terms

1063
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,109
our next some sequencing Bates probes

1064
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:17,550
targets they all essentially mean the

1065
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,630
same thing they're all different

1066
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,340
laboratory methods to pull out a

1067
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,869
specific region of interest

1068
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:26,130
I mentioned RNA sequencing in this case

1069
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,290
RNA of course the dynamic range is much

1070
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:30,720
different than DNA DNA should be one

1071
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,290
copy to copy to copy for and above RNA

1072
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:37,020
sequencing is much more continuous cells

1073
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,300
been turned on and off RNA to divide a

1074
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,310
variety of levels I try to make this

1075
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,080
plot for almost all the RNA seek data I

1076
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,060
looked at I just basically take all the

1077
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,770
genes or all the exons and I just sort

1078
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:49,740
them by how many reads match to them you

1079
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,090
should basically always get this S curve

1080
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:54,150
very very highly expressed off or very

1081
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,800
very low expression but actually a lot

1082
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,420
of the biological actions kind of in

1083
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,780
this middle sort of this middle region

1084
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,220
I just shown this example here we have

1085
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,200
this patient i pressing a patient a

1086
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,060
patient with breast cancer there's three

1087
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,980
very important genes for subtyping

1088
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,410
subtyping breast cancer and if you

1089
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,930
basically color all the exons that

1090
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,400
correspond to these genes you can see

1091
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:14,960
there also

1092
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,380
this kale trending to zero and then as a

1093
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,970
reference set here's two totally

1094
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,010
different patients one who's er positive

1095
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,840
one who's er negative and you can see

1096
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,610
the ER positive breast cancer is

1097
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,200
basically expressing ESR one at a

1098
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,300
relatively high level certainly compared

1099
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,980
to the negatives and the negative

1100
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,570
basically looks a lot more like this

1101
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,040
patients are really a very simple

1102
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,510
example of how you can use a reference

1103
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,850
set to put your gene or your gene

1104
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,070
expression level in context with other

1105
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,440
genes from similar tumors of the cell

1106
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,420
via of the same type the other data type

1107
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,330
not nearly as widely used as as exome

1108
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:53,900
genome RNA sequencing is is bisulfite

1109
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,240
sequencing or really what's being

1110
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,030
increasingly termed methyl seek so in

1111
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,680
this case you essentially treat your DNA

1112
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,740
with a chemical if your if your meth if

1113
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,720
your essentially your C base your

1114
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,090
cytosine base is protected by a chemical

1115
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,950
modification it doesn't get changed but

1116
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,780
if you don't have that modification this

1117
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,730
chemical has ability to then change that

1118
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:15,920
C to a T so here's what that data

1119
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,290
actually looks like otherwise exactly

1120
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:20,360
the same workflow is for whole genome

1121
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,650
sequencing you just do that chemical

1122
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,510
modification at the start in this case

1123
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:26,120
we're looking specifically at mlh1 so

1124
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,100
important DNA repair gene I talked about

1125
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,740
context of neuroblastoma here the here

1126
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,960
the exons here along the bottom in this

1127
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,370
case were very interested in this first

1128
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,300
exon because it has this little

1129
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,700
regulatory region and that regulatory

1130
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,970
region is under the control of of

1131
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,620
promoter methylation so essentially what

1132
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,900
we're looking for is if that stretch of

1133
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,750
DNA essentially is painted or of all the

1134
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,390
C's all have a methyl a methyl group it

1135
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,220
shuts down expression them.the of this

1136
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,320
and if those methyl groups are removed

1137
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,810
or are not present that then allows the

1138
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:59,030
gene to be transcribed sensitive it

1139
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,170
looks like a normal tissue it's

1140
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:02,360
unmethylated so all these C's don't have

1141
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,610
the have they protecting protecting

1142
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,860
methyl group essentially we know that

1143
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,540
this normal tissue normally expressed

1144
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,940
mlh1 so that normal healthy cell is able

1145
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,250
to repair its DNA compare that to

1146
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:16,340
endometrial cancer here all of the all

1147
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,500
of the C's is specifically in that

1148
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,960
region are completely methylated so all

1149
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,820
the C's stay FC they were protected from

1150
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,170
that chemical and essentially we can

1151
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:27,369
tell in this case this is actually a

1152
00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:28,960
agnostic test only focused on the

1153
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,150
promoter you can see even by eye though

1154
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,380
that really that promoter is not

1155
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,839
methylated and essentially mlh1 is not

1156
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:37,180
active specific than this tumor the

1157
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,619
reason you do this test in this tumor

1158
00:42:38,619 --> 00:42:40,119
this specific type is actually famous

1159
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:42,309
for frequently having loss of DNA

1160
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,619
mismatch repair and this is one

1161
00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:46,119
technology that allows you to look not

1162
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:47,920
just that that one gene but a whole

1163
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,660
cassette of genes associated with with

1164
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:55,180
MMR this is also often serve a handy

1165
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,829
checklist suspicious you're thinking of

1166
00:42:56,829 --> 00:42:58,119
how do you design a scientific

1167
00:42:58,119 --> 00:42:59,920
experiment here all the different types

1168
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,690
of genome assays I've just talked about

1169
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:03,400
and here all the ways that the cancer

1170
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,380
genome can go wrong and I'm just gonna

1171
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,849
spend a little bit of brief time just

1172
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:08,890
showing data examples of what does a

1173
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,180
mutation look like what does a copy

1174
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:13,210
number variant look like in specific

1175
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,880
types of data other than you start

1176
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,349
questions up to this point just since we

1177
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:20,410
got to calling before we go into detail

1178
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:24,579
on each of these variant types okay

1179
00:43:24,579 --> 00:43:27,519
great okay so I just want to start with

1180
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:29,619
somatic mutations I really encourage you

1181
00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:32,019
not to just trust the output of your

1182
00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:33,009
callers it's actually pretty

1183
00:43:33,009 --> 00:43:34,420
straightforward especially after this

1184
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:37,569
workshop to get raw reads align them I

1185
00:43:37,569 --> 00:43:39,880
call mutations but really absolutely

1186
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,069
must go that extra mile to actually look

1187
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:43,569
at the underlying reads that support

1188
00:43:43,569 --> 00:43:45,460
those variant calls especially if

1189
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,619
there's something biologically out of

1190
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:49,269
place so it's very unusual for example

1191
00:43:49,269 --> 00:43:51,339
to get three mutations in the same gene

1192
00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:52,660
unless you're looking at all these

1193
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,749
subclonal these subclonal variants so

1194
00:43:55,749 --> 00:43:57,130
option if i especially if I see three

1195
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:59,140
mutations side by side I always just

1196
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,880
open up the reads right away and ask the

1197
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,640
quick question are those mutations next

1198
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,079
to each other are they all on the same

1199
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:06,880
read should they actually have been

1200
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,099
treated as one very complex mutation

1201
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:10,420
it's very hard to write a little script

1202
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,309
that can go out and do this for you for

1203
00:44:12,309 --> 00:44:14,049
every single edge case from mutation

1204
00:44:14,049 --> 00:44:16,119
caller very powerful just to open up

1205
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:19,420
reads and look at the man that GP so

1206
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,859
here's what the real mutation or real

1207
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:22,599
variant looks like so same sort of thing

1208
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:26,079
coverage along the top here reads re

1209
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,059
sort of a read stack and we're looking

1210
00:44:28,059 --> 00:44:29,650
for positions that look like this in

1211
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:32,529
this case half the reads have a C have

1212
00:44:32,529 --> 00:44:34,299
two reads have a T in this case the

1213
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:36,160
allele balance you actually hear a few

1214
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,529
words that refer to leo balanced parent

1215
00:44:38,529 --> 00:44:40,850
allele frequency bath

1216
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,890
mutation frequency is another one

1217
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:44,750
mutation allele fractions these all mean

1218
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,940
the same thing what fraction of your

1219
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:50,420
reads have a non reference base so in

1220
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,520
this case the Leo balance or BAFF I

1221
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,620
would probably normally say is 0.47 or

1222
00:44:54,620 --> 00:45:02,060
47% there are a few I guess aspects of

1223
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,220
cancer tissue that can cause that valve

1224
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,560
to drift away from from 50% so the

1225
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,470
reason this is so close to 50% is if you

1226
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,720
have a perfectly pure cancer cell

1227
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,250
population you have two copies of each

1228
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,620
allele one of them is mutant one of them

1229
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,630
it's not there for half of your DNA

1230
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:19,910
should have a mutation so in theory and

1231
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,620
a sort of a perfect sample certainly in

1232
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:24,770
a germline variant where all the copies

1233
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:25,820
of all the chromosomes are two

1234
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,320
essentially you should have allele

1235
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,110
balance very very very close to 50% just

1236
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:31,970
by sampling error you can get up to you

1237
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:35,930
know 60 maybe 65% or down to 40 maybe

1238
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:38,600
35% but in general all of the your

1239
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,170
variants in a totally pure hat like

1240
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:46,010
diploid cell should be 50% this almost

1241
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,690
never happens with a cancer sample for

1242
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:49,220
all those other reasons double the

1243
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,990
genome you have copy number changes you

1244
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:53,420
have non cancerous cells the DNA

1245
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,700
certainly we get in clinical labs are

1246
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:59,090
very poor so the priority certainly in

1247
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,710
pathology departments is to protect us

1248
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:04,550
to collect and preserve tissue for

1249
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:06,550
histology over everything else

1250
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:08,450
obviously appropriate that's how you

1251
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:10,790
actually get the cancer diagnosis so

1252
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:14,380
essentially you get a tumor sample it's

1253
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,700
essentially preserved in formalin and

1254
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,620
embedded in a wax block this has the

1255
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,210
benefit that you actually store these

1256
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,100
tissues at room temperature you can then

1257
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,810
take thin sections and look at from the

1258
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:25,700
hardware microscope unfortunately as you

1259
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,860
can see on this slide it results in

1260
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:31,220
short on damaged DNA so in this case

1261
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:33,200
this is a DNA ladder so this is high

1262
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,660
molecular weight DNA that's more or less

1263
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,870
intact this is highly fragmented

1264
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:40,070
essentially from one of my first papers

1265
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:42,410
ever but the lesson still has still held

1266
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:43,940
even from formalin-fixed

1267
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,590
paraffin-embedded tissues you can in

1268
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:46,910
general get still get high molecular

1269
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:49,250
weight DNA but I ordered these samples

1270
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:50,920
essentially from good to bad

1271
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,910
in fact in Maine twelve here this was a

1272
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:56,950
metastases to bone and that that tissue

1273
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,109
is essentially decalcified that Keith

1274
00:46:59,109 --> 00:47:01,059
decalcification process completely

1275
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:02,650
destroyed the DNA so that one's pretty

1276
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:04,900
much unusable but in general genomic

1277
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:05,980
techniques have actually gotten better

1278
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,540
and better at starting to use these

1279
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,030
highly fragmented low-quality but still

1280
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:13,390
pretty usable sources of DNA but this is

1281
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:14,950
really a bit sort of number one question

1282
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,809
is so should I get a sample I've never

1283
00:47:16,809 --> 00:47:19,119
seen before or the quality control is

1284
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,339
not as good or I'm not finding mutations

1285
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,200
it's always very helpful to go back to

1286
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,000
understand what is the history of that

1287
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:38,619
tissue prior to sequencing it's yeah so

1288
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:41,109
Roma's question was really around is it

1289
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:42,760
improvements in the lab processing of

1290
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,410
the tissue and I guess maybe the

1291
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:46,030
library's processing as well or the

1292
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,250
analysis it's probably all of those but

1293
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,839
I think the library construction is what

1294
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:51,700
has improved the most how do you take

1295
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,319
DNA like this and make a high-quality

1296
00:47:53,319 --> 00:47:55,630
library that represents all the DNA

1297
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:57,520
fragments that were in the original

1298
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,079
sample I think that's the layer that's

1299
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:01,390
approved the most by our formatic

1300
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:02,680
techniques certainly for quality control

1301
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,240
have gotten better knowing that this is

1302
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,270
an issue but still I mean the number one

1303
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:10,150
thing I'm looking for in a new kit that

1304
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:12,099
makes that library so that second step

1305
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:14,020
and that workflow is how do you

1306
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,819
effectively put those adapters onto

1307
00:48:15,819 --> 00:48:17,589
every piece of DNA because it's very

1308
00:48:17,589 --> 00:48:19,180
hard to capture especially this DNA

1309
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,700
that's highly fragmented down here so if

1310
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,809
anyone wants to make millions of dollars

1311
00:48:22,809 --> 00:48:25,210
a better ligates to put adapters on or

1312
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,309
some well turns into that it's still a

1313
00:48:27,309 --> 00:48:29,099
big unsolved problem so we're still

1314
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:31,660
you're doing very very well if half of

1315
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,819
your DNA that you extract actually make

1316
00:48:33,819 --> 00:48:35,380
it into your next-generation sequencing

1317
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,819
library it's still a very challenging

1318
00:48:36,819 --> 00:48:41,099
lab problem the other challenge is

1319
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:43,750
tuners are not 100 percent cancer cells

1320
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:44,950
so you notice I always try to

1321
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:46,900
distinguish between tumors and cancer

1322
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,319
tumors to me are all the cells in a mass

1323
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,990
and cancer cells are the specific cells

1324
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:55,270
that are cancer within the tumor

1325
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:56,980
microenvironment so I'm just showing

1326
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:00,520
here this is actually a planning diagram

1327
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,380
for a laser capture microdissection this

1328
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,339
is actually a lung adenocarcinoma

1329
00:49:03,339 --> 00:49:04,310
Matassa

1330
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:06,410
sighs to a lymph node on this case that

1331
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:07,670
have gone through circled out all the

1332
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:09,560
tumors but you can see all the

1333
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,120
intervening stroma and other types of

1334
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,280
cells that are in here as well and in

1335
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,470
this case essentially for every read of

1336
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:17,960
cancer drive DNA we sequence there's a

1337
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,240
second read corresponding to one of the

1338
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,130
normal DNA and this is really why we

1339
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,450
have to have very very deep sequencing

1340
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:26,840
we need 100 I'm prompt in many cases

1341
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,850
more than 100x coverage just because

1342
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:30,740
half of those reads are just not going

1343
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,570
to have any chance of having any somatic

1344
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:37,040
mutations at all the other way to

1345
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,720
distort of too

1346
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,280
buzz words to describe this concept

1347
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,620
tumor purity or to more content both of

1348
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,540
these mean the same thing what fraction

1349
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:47,000
of your tumor of your tumor cells are

1350
00:49:47,000 --> 00:50:00,980
truly cancer versus not the answers or

1351
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:05,030
from a slide like this yeah I mean so

1352
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,950
from histology essentially this is what

1353
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:08,840
pathologists do you can look and

1354
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,540
classify cells you can't really do it

1355
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:13,460
using DNA sequencing video you know

1356
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,170
they're all diploid in general they all

1357
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:18,470
look they all look very similar to the

1358
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,660
match normal so it's very hard using DNA

1359
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,970
sequencing RNA sequencing has a

1360
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:24,620
challenge so if you just take a sample

1361
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,150
like this and grind it up you're now

1362
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:27,860
looking at a mixture of gene expression

1363
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,230
profiles cancer and lung cancer they're

1364
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,850
actually whole algorithms now that rely

1365
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:33,890
on that fact because you can look

1366
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:36,650
specifically at transcripts from from

1367
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:38,180
knowing immune cells and infer the

1368
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,510
presence of immune cells the real the

1369
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:43,820
only path as far as I know to actually

1370
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,590
do this is to get down to single-cell

1371
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:47,990
RNA sequencing to essentially digest the

1372
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:49,460
tissue like this into free-floating

1373
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,290
single cells and sequence them one by

1374
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:51,610
one

1375
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:54,050
Jim genomically that's really the only

1376
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,690
true way to really pinpoint exactly the

1377
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:57,830
cellular composition

1378
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:59,510
flow cytometry is actually another good

1379
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,850
way and so there are ways to do it but

1380
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,470
just using conventional genomics which

1381
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:04,840
is cotton extract

1382
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,950
very very difficult so we talked about

1383
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:12,730
tumor purity and tumor content the other

1384
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:16,330
yeah I'm sure

1385
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:20,280
so read-depth is just how many reads do

1386
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,930
you have at the position so the read

1387
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:24,420
depth here is 19 X so in this case this

1388
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,130
variance very easy to find because half

1389
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:28,470
of the 19 are gonna have a seat after

1390
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:30,930
gonna have a tea roughly the challenge

1391
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:32,730
actually have a slide on this later will

1392
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:34,920
be what if only half of yourselves a

1393
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,839
tumor so now we're looking at not at 10

1394
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:39,569
sees we're actually looking at 5 sees of

1395
00:51:39,569 --> 00:51:42,059
5 out of 20 so if this was actually only

1396
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:43,890
10x coverage now instead of 5 we're

1397
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:45,420
looking at 2 so as your coverage goes

1398
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,890
down it gets harder and harder to find

1399
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:49,230
these rare variants I have a slide on

1400
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:50,549
this a little bit later but yeah

1401
00:51:50,549 --> 00:51:52,500
coverage read that both of these mean

1402
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,329
the same thing how tall is you reads

1403
00:51:54,329 --> 00:51:56,400
that at a given position and actually

1404
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,369
you can see in the whole genome there is

1405
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:01,470
some fluctuation to it so at each

1406
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:02,910
position that's why we always report

1407
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:04,980
read depth for coverages on average or

1408
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,960
median because the stand deviation can

1409
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,819
actually be pretty wide actually great

1410
00:52:08,819 --> 00:52:10,770
example here in the excel these two

1411
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:12,599
exons are right next to each other this

1412
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:14,460
guy probably has twice as many reasons

1413
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:15,900
yeah they're purely for technical

1414
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:21,720
reasons in the lab the other confounder

1415
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,250
I showed the slide earlier is this idea

1416
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,289
appointee or tumor copies so in this

1417
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:26,670
case if you're looking for a mutation on

1418
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:29,520
chromosome 7 if it's only on one of the

1419
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,289
five chromosomes this is gonna be a very

1420
00:52:31,289 --> 00:52:33,000
challenging defying mutation because

1421
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,299
first of all not all tumor cells or

1422
00:52:36,299 --> 00:52:38,069
cancer cells and even within the cancer

1423
00:52:38,069 --> 00:52:40,319
you're looking at one copy inside so

1424
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,640
really this is we're finding these

1425
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,260
extraordinarily rare mutations

1426
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,049
especially if they're on an individual

1427
00:52:46,049 --> 00:52:48,150
chromosome that's been amplified are

1428
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:51,470
very difficult very difficult to uncover

1429
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,849
on the other hand if you had a mutation

1430
00:52:53,849 --> 00:52:55,529
on chromosome 7 before it was amplified

1431
00:52:55,529 --> 00:52:57,180
those mutations are very easy to find

1432
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,339
because one tumor cells putting in five

1433
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:01,740
copies of that of that needle so it sort

1434
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,510
of has a bit of a double-edged

1435
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:04,859
short-sword depending on the type of

1436
00:53:04,859 --> 00:53:07,700
variation that you're looking to find

1437
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,170
looking just to your point here here's

1438
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:12,510
that sort of that idea of coverage this

1439
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:14,069
is actually the same sample sequence two

1440
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:16,230
different ways at the time conventional

1441
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:17,609
whole genome sequencing so I've zoomed

1442
00:53:17,609 --> 00:53:19,319
way out so all the reads look very small

1443
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:22,140
in this case 15 X coverage no hint

1444
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,450
whatsoever of a mutation contrast that

1445
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,010
to the same sample using exome

1446
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,690
sequencing this is important cancer gene

1447
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:29,940
and we actually found six of the 100

1448
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,339
39 reads actually did have the mutation

1449
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:34,050
and this is purely sampling just

1450
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,300
sequencing this 15 times is not enough

1451
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,380
to essentially find even one read or to

1452
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,960
have a chance to find even one read in

1453
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,599
the very action in this case it was sort

1454
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,420
of the combination of the worst possible

1455
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:51,569
so a perfect storm of low tumor content

1456
00:53:51,569 --> 00:53:53,069
and there was a copy number game that's

1457
00:53:53,069 --> 00:53:54,960
not muted to this position so very very

1458
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,030
difficult mutations defined hence the

1459
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:01,260
read for increased read depth the other

1460
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:14,430
benefit of whole genome yeah yeah

1461
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:16,680
exactly so reads equals dollars so

1462
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,849
essentially the question especially

1463
00:54:17,849 --> 00:54:19,680
designing experiment is where do you

1464
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,690
want to spend your budget is it going

1465
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:23,760
extraordinarily deep and relatively few

1466
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,859
regions this is why clinical labs really

1467
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:27,750
use the targeted panels because they're

1468
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:29,940
using these clinical samples they just

1469
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,920
put for the same budget go very very

1470
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:38,220
deep on relatively few targets yeah and

1471
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,619
this is where I'm a big proponent of

1472
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:42,839
comprehensive testing as part of

1473
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:44,099
clinical care because that actually

1474
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:46,560
amplifies research as well and I'm

1475
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,380
hoping the the case reports really gets

1476
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,750
at this point as well there's also the

1477
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,520
problem of what is the clinical

1478
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,220
significance of it extraordinarily rare

1479
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:59,579
you know three and or six and 139 Reed

1480
00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:01,800
sub-clause depends on the tissue

1481
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,550
altogether yes

1482
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,880
it really depends on your question so

1483
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:15,680
usually if the experimental design needs

1484
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,910
detection of variants of one and a

1485
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:20,460
hundred then I would back calculate from

1486
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,410
there so if I really need to have so a

1487
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:24,630
good example of cell free DNA if I want

1488
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:27,089
to find a piece of DNA of tumor DNA

1489
00:55:27,089 --> 00:55:29,310
that's circulating in blood let's say

1490
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:31,619
for the experiment I need it down to one

1491
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:35,280
percent sensitivity down to one percent

1492
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,619
and then you can back calculate okay I

1493
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:39,630
need one percent therefore I need this

1494
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:42,030
depth to have a chance to even find one

1495
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:42,570
in 100

1496
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:44,960
because you actually have to sequence

1497
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,980
right on 100 there's sort of a

1498
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,600
statistical model we can sequence a

1499
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,620
little bit more a little bit less

1500
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:52,310
depending on your thyroid sensitivity

1501
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:55,440
and then what genes do you need that

1502
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,210
sensitivity is it literally just in one

1503
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:00,060
spot is it a big panel do you need the

1504
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,980
entire genome sensitivity down to 1%

1505
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:05,040
extraordinarily expensive so there's

1506
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,780
really no rule there's sort of

1507
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,370
benchmarks that have been used so for

1508
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:10,800
the Cancer Genome Atlas the target of a

1509
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,010
hundred x median coverage across the

1510
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:17,160
exome most genome studies the POG

1511
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,780
program and in Vancouver where they're

1512
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:20,850
clinically acting on genome sequence

1513
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:22,890
they require 80 X coverage across the

1514
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:24,630
whole genome gives them a certain

1515
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:27,660
sensitivity nothing is ever perfect you

1516
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,070
don't have infinite budget that it

1517
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:31,290
there's really no lot really has to be

1518
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:33,750
tied to science question first and then

1519
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:40,470
back calculate it this is one example of

1520
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:41,880
what can be done with whole exome

1521
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,040
sequencing so in this case this is a 250

1522
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,680
X exome sequencing experiment we did to

1523
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:50,250
infer the tumor content of employee and

1524
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:52,470
them to look at some subclonal

1525
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:54,930
number variant or subclonal point

1526
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:56,850
mutations as well so here's a tool here

1527
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:58,740
it's called sequenza each little dot

1528
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,540
here is a point in the genome that had a

1529
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,270
germline snips we wanted to say is there

1530
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:05,160
an are there differences in copy number

1531
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,610
across the the entire genome so you just

1532
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:09,900
focus here here's the coverage

1533
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,850
normalized to a reference so if this was

1534
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:13,890
just a normal blood cell all of these

1535
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:15,570
tracks would perfectly line up at one

1536
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:16,950
you can see they obviously don't

1537
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:18,930
it's a copy number game here there's a

1538
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:21,570
deletion here big huge copy of all of

1539
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:25,700
chromosome 12 this tool essentially

1540
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:28,500
infers from this data what the likely

1541
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,690
tumor content and what the likely ploidy

1542
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:32,250
is so when basically using this

1543
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:34,200
algorithm and using this pattern of copy

1544
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,840
number changes and losses it says it's

1545
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:41,130
likely that 61% of your of your DNA come

1546
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:42,860
from tumor cells and those tumor cells

1547
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,840
have more gains than losses so a tumor

1548
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,900
purity of two means they are no gains or

1549
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,030
losses in this case there is a good

1550
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:52,770
portion of the genome that is gained

1551
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:54,300
it's not a complete genome double that

1552
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,329
will give you a

1553
00:57:55,329 --> 00:57:58,059
boy these four in this case it's likely

1554
00:57:58,059 --> 00:57:59,709
just a diploid and then these very large

1555
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:01,959
gains of chromosomes likely brought that

1556
00:58:01,959 --> 00:58:04,419
average up you can see there's actually

1557
00:58:04,419 --> 00:58:06,339
multiple solutions from this algorithm

1558
00:58:06,339 --> 00:58:07,929
so I've just shown the most likely one

1559
00:58:07,929 --> 00:58:09,219
here but this is really other it's very

1560
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:12,249
important to work with especially the

1561
00:58:12,249 --> 00:58:13,659
pathology team that's working with the

1562
00:58:13,659 --> 00:58:14,859
tissue to really give you insight into

1563
00:58:14,859 --> 00:58:17,679
the tumor type what is the likely ploidy

1564
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:19,599
do these genomes always double

1565
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:21,069
themselves because maybe then you want

1566
00:58:21,069 --> 00:58:24,189
to change your your model for tumor

1567
00:58:24,189 --> 00:58:26,229
content tumor purity and also just

1568
00:58:26,229 --> 00:58:28,899
looking at the slide it says 61% but

1569
00:58:28,899 --> 00:58:32,109
there's 10% tumor cells or the whole

1570
00:58:32,109 --> 00:58:34,089
thing is just in the face lymph node

1571
00:58:34,089 --> 00:58:36,849
it's 100% tumor cells that really has to

1572
00:58:36,849 --> 00:58:38,859
go into the interpretation of this

1573
00:58:38,859 --> 00:58:41,589
mathematics result a second tool here

1574
00:58:41,589 --> 00:58:43,299
called PI clone in this case each little

1575
00:58:43,299 --> 00:58:44,859
stripe here is an individual mutation

1576
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:47,079
this is the calibrated cellular

1577
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:48,789
frequency so all these mutations here

1578
00:58:48,789 --> 00:58:50,559
essentially are in a hundred percent of

1579
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,630
the tumor cells with the assumption that

1580
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:55,089
the tumor content is 61 percent so

1581
00:58:55,089 --> 00:58:57,130
there's sort of some calibration of that

1582
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:58,989
allele balance variant allele frequency

1583
00:58:58,989 --> 00:59:00,729
whatever you want to call it and

1584
00:59:00,729 --> 00:59:02,319
essentially this algorithm bins them

1585
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,359
into clonal mutations using mutations

1586
00:59:04,359 --> 00:59:07,149
that are in every cancer cell sub-clonal

1587
00:59:07,149 --> 00:59:09,099
mutations and then actually extrude the

1588
00:59:09,099 --> 00:59:10,989
only reason we saw these extremely rare

1589
00:59:10,989 --> 00:59:13,119
mutations it's cuz we sequence these two

1590
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,949
very high def so we actually have the

1591
00:59:14,949 --> 00:59:16,869
likelihood to pick up these variants

1592
00:59:16,869 --> 00:59:19,209
that are only have real fractions around

1593
00:59:19,209 --> 00:59:37,419
20% yeah so you know I'm sure you've

1594
00:59:37,419 --> 00:59:38,979
seen these beautiful like phylogenetic

1595
00:59:38,979 --> 00:59:41,499
trees they assume that all the copy

1596
00:59:41,499 --> 00:59:43,359
number variants or mutations at the same

1597
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:45,759
allele frequency belong to the same cell

1598
00:59:45,759 --> 00:59:47,499
or population but you don't actually

1599
00:59:47,499 --> 00:59:48,369
know that

1600
00:59:48,369 --> 00:59:49,869
so the assumption here is all these

1601
00:59:49,869 --> 00:59:53,409
mutations have the same bath they at

1602
00:59:53,409 --> 00:59:55,119
least as published they belong on the

1603
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,309
same cell of the same population you

1604
00:59:57,309 --> 00:59:58,659
can't actually know that without

1605
00:59:58,659 --> 01:00:00,699
sequencing individual cell and almost

1606
01:00:00,699 --> 01:00:02,499
definitely there may be you know

1607
01:00:02,499 --> 01:00:03,669
especially towards the end here these

1608
01:00:03,669 --> 01:00:05,169
are sort of starting to tail off there

1609
01:00:05,169 --> 01:00:06,579
might actually be an additional clone

1610
01:00:06,579 --> 01:00:07,510
here so

1611
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:12,250
is really very challenging these axonal

1612
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:14,140
pilo Janee or her

1613
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:17,230
yeah these como had clonal phylogeny

1614
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:19,570
reconstruction methods and actually

1615
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:21,820
publish Osen Quaid Morris wrote a really

1616
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:23,320
great talk where they essentially or

1617
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,530
great paper where they essentially

1618
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:27,730
compared all these different

1619
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:29,110
reconstruction methods and they often

1620
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:30,970
gave quite different in some cases

1621
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:33,610
diverging results so it's really not a

1622
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:35,050
solved problem certainly from the bulk

1623
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:37,300
data and this is rather divided become

1624
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,340
such a fan of single sale sequencing

1625
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,570
approaches because you can really be

1626
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:43,240
very quantitative around what subclones

1627
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,270
are where and present at what frequency

1628
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:48,370
because this is purely imprints of

1629
01:00:48,370 --> 01:00:50,530
statistical inference based on allele

1630
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:52,770
fractions

1631
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:07,180
yeah you really need some gold standards

1632
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:08,830
and it actually turns out those

1633
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:11,350
algorithms are very good in the author's

1634
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:16,000
area of disease expertise so often you

1635
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,890
really want to work in myeloma for

1636
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:21,430
example with a group that knows how what

1637
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:23,200
driver mutations are relevant most

1638
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,670
frequently in that disease what are the

1639
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:26,890
true clonal founder mutations because

1640
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:27,970
they're not always the same across

1641
01:01:27,970 --> 01:01:30,460
cancer types and ultimately doing

1642
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:32,230
experiment yourself taking two cell

1643
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,750
lines putting them together or two cell

1644
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:36,970
lines are two samples from the same

1645
01:01:36,970 --> 01:01:38,560
patient over time look at how those

1646
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,780
phylogenetic trees over time those

1647
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:43,870
change between the two time points you

1648
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:45,700
really need some gold reference

1649
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:48,700
standards it's just very hard to show up

1650
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:51,340
and just run these tools on your own

1651
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,990
data they really take a lot of care

1652
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:55,690
stand them disease specific knowledge

1653
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:58,240
around how complex should that clonal

1654
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:02,470
heterogeneity be yeah it's not sort of a

1655
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:06,360
plug and chug kind of tool

1656
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:09,700
I've talked exclusively about Illumina

1657
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,410
sequencing I'm going to continue to do

1658
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:12,700
that but I did want to talk about some

1659
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:15,640
other some other technologies one being

1660
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:18,550
a bio sequencing this system actually

1661
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:19,880
has the huge benefit

1662
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:23,420
a little tiny 50 to 150 base pair reads

1663
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:26,180
this can generate at ten or ten thousand

1664
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:28,130
plus base pairs so I talked earlier

1665
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:30,259
about that challenge of the unreadable

1666
01:02:30,259 --> 01:02:32,900
portion of the genome the PacBio and

1667
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,150
nanopores actually several technologies

1668
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:36,859
that could essentially allow your

1669
01:02:36,859 --> 01:02:39,710
sequence huge chunks of DNA with the

1670
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:41,509
downside that they result they have a

1671
01:02:41,509 --> 01:02:44,059
very high artifact weight so you can see

1672
01:02:44,059 --> 01:02:46,220
just by eye there's a lot going on in

1673
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,109
these reads the mutation of interest is

1674
01:02:48,109 --> 01:02:49,730
right here here's the Illumina

1675
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:52,309
sequencing nice and clean very very low

1676
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:53,839
error rate very obvious where the

1677
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:55,400
mutations are both in point mutations

1678
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,619
and in in Dells but don't discount these

1679
01:02:57,619 --> 01:02:59,150
technologies I mean obviously real

1680
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,799
variants are coming through and

1681
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:01,940
essentially bad formatting techniques

1682
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:04,910
are needed to essentially normalize out

1683
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:06,799
the background sequence or error from

1684
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:08,750
other next-generation sequencing

1685
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:11,420
technologies and very powerful certainly

1686
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:16,099
as a cross-validation these longley

1687
01:03:16,099 --> 01:03:17,720
technology is especially powerful

1688
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,490
certainly for pathogen sequencing

1689
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:22,339
sequencing complete bacterial genomes

1690
01:03:22,339 --> 01:03:24,890
complete viral genomes the challenge

1691
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:26,720
with them with clinical samples is you

1692
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,430
saw a on that slide all the DNA comes

1693
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:31,009
pre fragmented so it's really impossible

1694
01:03:31,009 --> 01:03:33,230
like you're never you don't even have a

1695
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:35,720
fragment to even sequence to tens of

1696
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,970
thousands of the sequence tens with

1697
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:39,950
thousands of base pairs so it's been

1698
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:41,539
really very challenging to applying

1699
01:03:41,539 --> 01:03:44,809
these long read sequencers to two

1700
01:03:44,809 --> 01:03:46,400
clinical samples this is really where

1701
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,900
you want to think about where your

1702
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,460
samples coming from what do you know

1703
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:51,680
about them is the DNA even long enough

1704
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,569
for the type of downstream experiment

1705
01:03:53,569 --> 01:03:57,140
that you're gonna do I'm gonna need you

1706
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:58,730
talking a little bit about depth as well

1707
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:01,940
so I just sort of double down on that

1708
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,470
mutation detection sensitivity is

1709
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:05,420
dictated by your depth or your coverage

1710
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:07,430
and it's limited by your sequencer and

1711
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:09,019
your background sequence or air so this

1712
01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:11,089
is essentially a plot from a paper we

1713
01:04:11,089 --> 01:04:13,190
published a couple years ago essentially

1714
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:15,410
looking at the allele fraction

1715
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:17,750
detectable and then your total overall

1716
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:20,000
coverage so exilim sequencing TCGA we

1717
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,220
usually sequenced 200x coverage I guess

1718
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:24,289
pretty good detection down to a certain

1719
01:04:24,289 --> 01:04:25,069
probability

1720
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:27,890
around 10% maybe a little bit lower to

1721
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:30,019
be very confident in a clinical ably

1722
01:04:30,019 --> 01:04:32,599
about 555 gene panel that sequence to a

1723
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:33,119
thousand

1724
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,799
coverage gives you a pretty robust

1725
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:37,680
mutation calling down 1% but certainly

1726
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,240
if you want to get to highly complex

1727
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,980
mixtures like circulating tumor DNA

1728
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,839
you're really looking at 10,000 to

1729
01:04:42,839 --> 01:04:44,759
25,000 x coverage and this is sort of

1730
01:04:44,759 --> 01:04:45,990
the rationale at least for this study

1731
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:48,269
does sequence to a very very high depth

1732
01:04:48,269 --> 01:04:49,829
because we wanted to detect these very

1733
01:04:49,829 --> 01:04:52,549
very low allele fraction variants

1734
01:04:52,549 --> 01:04:55,380
essentially diluted by normal DNA in the

1735
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:59,160
blood stream so essentially the concept

1736
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:02,249
is exactly the same so cell free DNA is

1737
01:05:02,249 --> 01:05:02,940
very attractive

1738
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,609
essentially a 2's tumor cells die they

1739
01:05:05,609 --> 01:05:07,859
shed their DNA into the blood stream we

1740
01:05:07,859 --> 01:05:09,210
can use all the concepts i've just

1741
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:10,619
talked about to find those very very

1742
01:05:10,619 --> 01:05:15,299
rare mutations in this basically in DNA

1743
01:05:15,299 --> 01:05:17,009
extracted from the liquid portion of

1744
01:05:17,009 --> 01:05:18,390
blood so i'm not going to talk very much

1745
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:20,430
about circulating tumor cells but

1746
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:22,289
specifically the application here at DNA

1747
01:05:22,289 --> 01:05:24,569
that's been shed and diluted into that

1748
01:05:24,569 --> 01:05:26,759
liquid portion we showed them all to

1749
01:05:26,759 --> 01:05:28,109
myeloma this actually worked very well

1750
01:05:28,109 --> 01:05:29,970
in fact almost better than bone marrow

1751
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:31,589
aspirates we're able to find not just

1752
01:05:31,589 --> 01:05:34,289
mutations from the primary tumor itself

1753
01:05:34,289 --> 01:05:36,079
but also additional mutations from other

1754
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:39,690
masses present within that patient the

1755
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:40,829
other benefit of blood of course you can

1756
01:05:40,829 --> 01:05:42,029
take it much more frequently than you

1757
01:05:42,029 --> 01:05:45,680
can a solid tumor a solid tumor biopsy

1758
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,609
this is what the data look like they're

1759
01:05:47,609 --> 01:05:49,410
actually two big methods out there one

1760
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:51,210
is PCR based so you put a primer on

1761
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:53,099
either side of your exon of interest in

1762
01:05:53,099 --> 01:05:55,859
this case and sequence them the method

1763
01:05:55,859 --> 01:05:57,329
we use and I talked about on the

1764
01:05:57,329 --> 01:05:59,369
previous slide was based on this cat

1765
01:05:59,369 --> 01:06:01,079
seed paper of Scott Bratton section out

1766
01:06:01,079 --> 01:06:03,900
here in Toronto a hybrid capture panel

1767
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,910
basically pulls down DNA sitting on your

1768
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:08,099
exons the downside with having captures

1769
01:06:08,099 --> 01:06:12,180
you actually also pull down all the DNA

1770
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,130
sequences immediately adjacent so while

1771
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:15,690
most your coverage is right on top of

1772
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:17,730
your exon of interest you do have this

1773
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:20,369
sort of off target problem reads our

1774
01:06:20,369 --> 01:06:22,289
dollars so this is slightly more it's

1775
01:06:22,289 --> 01:06:24,809
more expensive to get coverage

1776
01:06:24,809 --> 01:06:26,460
specifically on your target of interest

1777
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:28,140
but essentially the data look the same

1778
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:29,519
you're looking for mutations you're

1779
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:31,079
looking for a very low allele fraction

1780
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:33,869
reads amongst the whole pile of normal

1781
01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:35,359
reads

1782
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:37,710
Scott well he was a postdoc at Stanford

1783
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:38,960
showed very nice correlation between

1784
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,789
size of tumor and amount of cell free

1785
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,980
DNA circulating in blood still very hard

1786
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:45,930
to find very early stage disease at that

1787
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:46,799
point

1788
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:48,359
certainly a tumor burden grew you had a

1789
01:06:48,359 --> 01:06:51,209
good a good ability to find tumor

1790
01:06:51,209 --> 01:06:54,089
derived DNA and as tumors grow and

1791
01:06:54,089 --> 01:06:55,769
shrink during clinical trial very tight

1792
01:06:55,769 --> 01:06:57,479
correlation between cell-free DNA and

1793
01:06:57,479 --> 01:06:59,299
red and tumor volume measured

1794
01:06:59,299 --> 01:07:01,349
radiographically so this tumor shrank

1795
01:07:01,349 --> 01:07:03,269
you got less cell free DNA and so on and

1796
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,009
so forth really the ability to do some

1797
01:07:05,009 --> 01:07:06,839
pretty innovative monitoring and

1798
01:07:06,839 --> 01:07:09,329
tracking of patients as homer total

1799
01:07:09,329 --> 01:07:10,920
tumor burden that cells turning over

1800
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,420
dump their DNA into blood and be

1801
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:17,849
contracted you don't so this is the

1802
01:07:17,849 --> 01:07:19,049
other big challenge at least of

1803
01:07:19,049 --> 01:07:20,999
mutations in this case you have a single

1804
01:07:20,999 --> 01:07:23,640
mass that's coming and going certainly

1805
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:24,959
had that problem in Multan myeloma we

1806
01:07:24,959 --> 01:07:26,729
had one aspirin and we saw the same

1807
01:07:26,729 --> 01:07:28,559
mutation over and over we could not find

1808
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:31,319
it in that iliac crest aspirant but

1809
01:07:31,319 --> 01:07:32,789
there must have been another mat

1810
01:07:32,789 --> 01:07:34,049
somewhere else in the body that was

1811
01:07:34,049 --> 01:07:36,329
putting that DNA but there's starting to

1812
01:07:36,329 --> 01:07:38,400
change a little bit with a new antibody

1813
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,739
based method so when fans of Carvalho's

1814
01:07:40,739 --> 01:07:42,599
lab has invented an antibody against

1815
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:44,400
5-methylcytosine it pulls down all

1816
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,979
methylated DNA from blood very powerful

1817
01:07:46,979 --> 01:07:49,709
to look at cell of origin but you can't

1818
01:07:49,709 --> 01:07:50,880
really tell the difference between a

1819
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,829
metastatic site where a primary site

1820
01:07:52,829 --> 01:07:55,380
yeah because the same cell of origins

1821
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:56,969
just move to different part of the body

1822
01:07:56,969 --> 01:08:01,799
just a few brief comments on somatic

1823
01:08:01,799 --> 01:08:03,359
copy number alterations we've talked

1824
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:05,400
about this a lot this is actually a

1825
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,709
relatively old technology called Skye

1826
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:09,029
where essentially you have a probe

1827
01:08:09,029 --> 01:08:11,099
against each different region of the

1828
01:08:11,099 --> 01:08:12,869
genome gives you different color but you

1829
01:08:12,869 --> 01:08:14,670
can see really how complicated some of

1830
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:16,439
these cancer derived chromosomes can be

1831
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:19,049
as they rearrange and essentially stick

1832
01:08:19,049 --> 01:08:22,049
them cell or become rearranged or and

1833
01:08:22,049 --> 01:08:23,670
have increased copy or essentially stick

1834
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:25,710
themselves together in that and

1835
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:29,158
different combinations essentially the

1836
01:08:29,158 --> 01:08:31,078
whole way to find copy number variation

1837
01:08:31,078 --> 01:08:33,719
is by coverage so as you have more reads

1838
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:35,368
that corresponds to a copy number gain

1839
01:08:35,368 --> 01:08:36,899
and the point of this slide really

1840
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:38,279
showing the same results from old

1841
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:39,500
microarray technology

1842
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,368
exome sequencing and whole genome

1843
01:08:41,368 --> 01:08:42,839
sequencing they're actually really

1844
01:08:42,839 --> 01:08:44,460
robust copy number profiles available

1845
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:47,488
even from targeted methods

1846
01:08:47,488 --> 01:08:49,229
here's an example from a clinical

1847
01:08:49,229 --> 01:08:51,960
clinical panel in this case not that

1848
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,179
many exons baited in EGFR but all of

1849
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:55,889
them have extraordinarily high coverage

1850
01:08:55,889 --> 01:08:57,479
so even from a targeted panel

1851
01:08:57,479 --> 01:09:00,060
actually abstract relatively robust copy

1852
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:01,859
number profiles purely by looking at the

1853
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:03,930
number of reads aligned to individual

1854
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:06,660
genes in this case p10 totally deleted

1855
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,520
even on the small panel p10 it's much

1856
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,950
sorry much larger than this but they

1857
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:13,319
only baited five of the exons no reads

1858
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:15,000
whatsoever from all five of them and for

1859
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,580
that as a copy never change and on the

1860
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:19,500
larger panels basically just fill in

1861
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,149
more dots so as you move from a targeted

1862
01:09:21,149 --> 01:09:23,130
panel to excel mark or genome

1863
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:25,470
essentially get more data to support the

1864
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:27,689
evidence of the game or a copy number

1865
01:09:27,689 --> 01:09:32,220
loss or amplification fusions

1866
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:33,569
essentially look like this so in this

1867
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:34,920
case when you have a breakpoint your

1868
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,689
reads hits the breakpoint but instead of

1869
01:09:36,689 --> 01:09:38,130
continuing on like it would in normal

1870
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:40,140
DNA essentially jumps the breakpoints

1871
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:42,689
you get this sort of read that has a

1872
01:09:42,689 --> 01:09:45,870
very unusual mapping structure in this

1873
01:09:45,870 --> 01:09:48,630
case all the deletions were different

1874
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:50,279
had different breakpoints in these

1875
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:51,689
tumors but they always stuck out the

1876
01:09:51,689 --> 01:09:54,299
exact same the exact same exons are the

1877
01:09:54,299 --> 01:09:56,700
C term all DNA so really what we saw by

1878
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,080
looking at large numbers of tumors

1879
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,850
essentially you have all these sort of

1880
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:01,350
raggedy breakpoints but you always took

1881
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:03,000
up the same functional units and that

1882
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,330
was really a key to discovering

1883
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:07,550
essentially the importance of deletions

1884
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:09,750
specifically in the C terminal region of

1885
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:12,930
EGFR as is what real data looks like so

1886
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:15,060
you have reads that very nicely aligned

1887
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:16,560
to the reference and then they look

1888
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,910
totally different the reason they look

1889
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:19,290
totally different because they belong to

1890
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:21,780
the partner gene in the fusion so

1891
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:23,670
essentially they're numerous algorithms

1892
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:24,930
now that go through and look for these

1893
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:27,510
translocation breakpoints unfortunately

1894
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:28,920
the false positive rate is very high

1895
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,450
with these algorithms because really

1896
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:32,250
additional needs to validate these

1897
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:36,860
algorithms but also to to essentially

1898
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:39,750
cross validates often what we'll do my

1899
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:41,940
lab will run to fusion callers and look

1900
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:44,420
at the overlap between the two methods

1901
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:46,890
these gonna be extraordinarily complex

1902
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:48,330
so Mike Berger when he wrote this

1903
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:50,460
prostate cancer paper essentially on a

1904
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:53,040
huge white board mapped out all the ways

1905
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,660
that these genes all linked to each

1906
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,790
other so he was able to show by hand

1907
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:59,220
tempera surgeon but also tempera Stu

1908
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:01,200
this middle-of-nowhere region that was

1909
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,880
fused tooth rat 3 and that was fused

1910
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,950
back there there is no bio from Attucks

1911
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:06,360
algorithm in the world that knew that

1912
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,659
this could happen

1913
01:11:07,659 --> 01:11:10,239
walk through all these breakpoints so at

1914
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:11,889
some point it is pen and paper work

1915
01:11:11,889 --> 01:11:13,449
knowing this now of course people have

1916
01:11:13,449 --> 01:11:15,040
now written algorithms like this but

1917
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,639
cancer does bizarre and crazy things and

1918
01:11:18,639 --> 01:11:20,290
it's obsession in this case to really

1919
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:22,480
just go after a pretty simple fusion

1920
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,070
which is just as temperature bridge of

1921
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:25,540
fusion very important in prostate cancer

1922
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:27,340
but there was this whole constellation

1923
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,260
of other changes happening around this

1924
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:30,790
one oncogenic advantages

1925
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:33,070
just like mutations you can have very

1926
01:11:33,070 --> 01:11:34,810
quiet very arrangement genomes

1927
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:37,449
extraordinarily rearranged genomes and

1928
01:11:37,449 --> 01:11:39,190
sort of everywhere in between this is a

1929
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:40,360
very interesting case from there

1930
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,820
blastoma nothing going on except for

1931
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:45,070
this shattering of chromosome 5 so this

1932
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:46,320
is an event called chromothripsis

1933
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,489
essentially chromosome 5 blew itself

1934
01:11:48,489 --> 01:11:49,630
apart and then was stitched back

1935
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:52,090
together resulting in the hyper

1936
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:54,010
rearrangement only of that single

1937
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:56,530
chromosome very important in prostate

1938
01:11:56,530 --> 01:11:58,840
cancer hasn't been seen very much since

1939
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:00,400
in pediatric cancer but if it could

1940
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,920
happen in one cancer type it can happen

1941
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:06,310
in another I see him I think I've failed

1942
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:11,610
10:30 is that right Michelle oh good ok

1943
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:16,570
I thought I was unusually behind ok so

1944
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:19,780
that sort of the DNA spatial answer

1945
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:21,670
questions on copy number changes

1946
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:24,280
rearrangements fusions things that

1947
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:27,820
happen in DNA in general ok so the run

1948
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:29,560
out to the talk is really in sort of the

1949
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,719
RNA and sort of functional space I

1950
01:12:31,719 --> 01:12:33,940
talked earlier about really the power of

1951
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:36,370
RNA to find relationships or linkages

1952
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:40,469
between exons so in this case this is a

1953
01:12:40,469 --> 01:12:42,400
published paper basically looking at

1954
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,679
this gene that's important to resistance

1955
01:12:44,679 --> 01:12:47,500
the 5-fluorouracil and what they did

1956
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,300
basically had this cell line called myth

1957
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:52,090
101 and then they treated that myth cell

1958
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:53,800
line with 5-fluorouracil and the

1959
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,780
question was what happens to this gene

1960
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:57,580
at the transcriptional level they knew

1961
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:58,870
from being a sequencing it wasn't

1962
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:00,130
mutated there wasn't a copy number

1963
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:01,420
change there was no structural

1964
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:05,469
alteration but this gene has really been

1965
01:13:05,469 --> 01:13:08,380
linked to resistance 5 3 or 5 floor of

1966
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:10,780
your cell what on earth is going on so

1967
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:13,000
what they did here was they did hold

1968
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,310
whole transcriptome sequencing looked at

1969
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:16,719
the reads that map dumps and basically

1970
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:20,149
counted the number of reads that map to

1971
01:13:20,149 --> 01:13:23,899
exon but also each exon exon boundary so

1972
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,550
focus on the blue line first so

1973
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:28,399
essentially read the line 2x on one you

1974
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:30,590
should have reads from on the junction

1975
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:33,499
from one to two like they did X on one

1976
01:13:33,499 --> 01:13:35,179
two three is unusual you shouldn't be

1977
01:13:35,179 --> 01:13:37,010
skipping from one to three whoops and

1978
01:13:37,010 --> 01:13:39,649
that does not happen and nor with a

1979
01:13:39,649 --> 01:13:41,899
normal cell line normal number of exon

1980
01:13:41,899 --> 01:13:44,389
to the two three junctions intact three

1981
01:13:44,389 --> 01:13:46,189
three four junctions attacked all the

1982
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:48,469
pieces make sense in untreated dumps

1983
01:13:48,469 --> 01:13:50,119
totally different when you treat it with

1984
01:13:50,119 --> 01:13:52,010
five per year so basically what happens

1985
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:55,309
is it starts to use this unusual exon

1986
01:13:55,309 --> 01:13:57,530
one exon three so essentially it's

1987
01:13:57,530 --> 01:14:00,079
completely skipping exon two here and

1988
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:01,729
you can see essentially the levels you

1989
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:03,409
know downstream on the gene are pretty

1990
01:14:03,409 --> 01:14:04,939
much the same really the only change

1991
01:14:04,939 --> 01:14:07,369
upon five four years so treatment is

1992
01:14:07,369 --> 01:14:10,159
this use of X out of this exon one to

1993
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:12,499
exxon three and a slight depletion of

1994
01:14:12,499 --> 01:14:14,269
the use of exon 2 like you'd expect

1995
01:14:14,269 --> 01:14:16,519
consistent with that with that skipping

1996
01:14:16,519 --> 01:14:18,649
event totally invisible using DNA

1997
01:14:18,649 --> 01:14:20,090
sequencing something you really could

1998
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:22,099
only see looking at the functional video

1999
01:14:22,099 --> 01:14:25,820
to the cell using RNA sequencing other

2000
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:28,309
than more conventional use of RNA

2001
01:14:28,309 --> 01:14:29,989
sequencing is gene expression profiling

2002
01:14:29,989 --> 01:14:32,479
I think there's a whole session on this

2003
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:34,879
essentially the idea of taking a huge

2004
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:39,129
met matrix of genes by samples and

2005
01:14:39,129 --> 01:14:42,289
comparing them looking for basically

2006
01:14:42,289 --> 01:14:44,479
differences in gene usage between two

2007
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:47,689
states the states can be pre true post

2008
01:14:47,689 --> 01:14:50,389
treatment tumor a tumor be there however

2009
01:14:50,389 --> 01:14:52,369
you want to dream up a way to compare

2010
01:14:52,369 --> 01:14:53,869
samples so you can do that using RNA

2011
01:14:53,869 --> 01:14:56,090
sequencing the other challenge is how

2012
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:57,619
many genes are you looking at to be

2013
01:14:57,619 --> 01:14:59,599
different between two states is it 100

2014
01:14:59,599 --> 01:15:02,050
is a five thousand is a two thousand

2015
01:15:02,050 --> 01:15:05,030
essentially that's a power question and

2016
01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:07,969
there's a statistical design question I

2017
01:15:07,969 --> 01:15:10,070
think you're gonna be covering that in

2018
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:15,469
additional workshop as well the other

2019
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:18,559
use at least if I used as I've used RNA

2020
01:15:18,559 --> 01:15:20,300
sequencing is trying to get a tissue of

2021
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:21,860
origin so in this case we looked at this

2022
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:24,320
very unusual pediatric lung cancer

2023
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,360
almost never happens in kids we really

2024
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,889
want to know actually only a cure some

2025
01:15:27,889 --> 01:15:30,619
women a very strange feature so we

2026
01:15:30,619 --> 01:15:32,179
really wanted to know where are these

2027
01:15:32,179 --> 01:15:33,050
cells coming from

2028
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:34,579
is to Trulia lung cancer it's coming

2029
01:15:34,579 --> 01:15:36,650
from somewhere else we took RNA

2030
01:15:36,650 --> 01:15:38,510
sequencing data from the that tumor and

2031
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:41,059
compared it to a whole host of healthy

2032
01:15:41,059 --> 01:15:44,599
normals so this is a this is um how the

2033
01:15:44,599 --> 01:15:46,429
color data here are all individual

2034
01:15:46,429 --> 01:15:49,460
tissue sequence by a gene tech gtex the

2035
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:51,260
gene do you know tight tissue expression

2036
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:53,630
project and their entire project was

2037
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:55,219
just grind at normal tissues and

2038
01:15:55,219 --> 01:15:58,579
sequence them not for cancer necessarily

2039
01:15:58,579 --> 01:16:00,320
but it turned out to be a great

2040
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,659
reference resource for us so here all

2041
01:16:02,659 --> 01:16:04,130
different parts of the brain from

2042
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:06,380
multiple donors they all clustered

2043
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:08,239
together like you'd expect same with

2044
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:10,460
lungs skin heart everything heart and

2045
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:12,860
muscle heart just bulk muscle are

2046
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:14,869
clustering nearer each other than brain

2047
01:16:14,869 --> 01:16:16,849
you know all the biology kind of makes

2048
01:16:16,849 --> 01:16:18,800
sense as well and then surprising to us

2049
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,420
these lung tumors actually all clustered

2050
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:22,849
specifically with muscles notice I've

2051
01:16:22,849 --> 01:16:25,159
been very smooth muscles specifically

2052
01:16:25,159 --> 01:16:27,590
and actually turns out that the tumor of

2053
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:30,139
origin for these or the cell board term

2054
01:16:30,139 --> 01:16:32,030
for these is actually the endometrial

2055
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:34,460
lining during development explains the

2056
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:37,219
female only source of these tumors and

2057
01:16:37,219 --> 01:16:39,290
essentially they leave the endometrium

2058
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:40,699
and they populate the lung and they

2059
01:16:40,699 --> 01:16:42,800
become this very unusual long sarcoma so

2060
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,159
extraordinary rare totally new high our

2061
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:48,290
hypothesis or explanation for potential

2062
01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:50,119
cell of origin and kicked off a whole

2063
01:16:50,119 --> 01:16:52,280
nother series hypothesis comes Ella's

2064
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,139
experiment and kicked off a whole nother

2065
01:16:54,139 --> 01:16:56,119
series of lab experiments to validate

2066
01:16:56,119 --> 01:16:59,630
that that finding but really shows the

2067
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:01,820
power of using public RNA sequencing

2068
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:03,199
data to augment your own research

2069
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:05,090
because really we only had you know five

2070
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:07,070
of her own of our own locally generated

2071
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:10,909
data they're augmented by probably

2072
01:17:10,909 --> 01:17:13,699
10,000 plus normal reference tissues now

2073
01:17:13,699 --> 01:17:20,110
scroogie text yes it's called gtex GTEs

2074
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:25,010
so the website is GTE export elorg it's

2075
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:27,559
grown much more since I this project you

2076
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:29,449
can essentially search for any tissue

2077
01:17:29,449 --> 01:17:30,110
type

2078
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:33,409
you can also subset by age and it's also

2079
01:17:33,409 --> 01:17:37,449
very interactive portals for you help I

2080
01:17:37,449 --> 01:17:40,550
talked a bit about nonhuman sequences

2081
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:42,409
earlier in this case taking all the

2082
01:17:42,409 --> 01:17:44,000
reads from an RNA sequencing experiment

2083
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,350
and we align them against

2084
01:17:46,350 --> 01:17:49,430
a base of basically all known pathogens

2085
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:52,770
curated by NCBI NCBI and this case

2086
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:54,060
you're actually able to totally

2087
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:55,650
unexpected this is a lung adenocarcinoma

2088
01:17:55,650 --> 01:17:58,140
project we're able to reconstruct the

2089
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:00,570
entire EBV genome epstein-barr virus

2090
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:02,730
very unusual and lung cancer especially

2091
01:18:02,730 --> 01:18:05,250
for our lung adenocarcinoma diagnosis

2092
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:07,800
that spurred a validation experiment

2093
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,930
where we had in sexual hybridization of

2094
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:12,930
EB V transcripts there are truly only

2095
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:14,490
tumor specifics all the normal

2096
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:17,910
surrounding cells were were negative for

2097
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:19,830
EBV and this actually turns out to be

2098
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:21,930
this very unusual lympho epithelial

2099
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:24,540
alike lung cancer essentially the lung

2100
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:25,920
adenocarcinoma was not the correct

2101
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,840
diagnosis was actually this more rare

2102
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,450
entity something that just you know flew

2103
01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:32,130
through in the RNA sequencing experiment

2104
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:33,780
not something that's nice oh yeah

2105
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:38,010
obviously I I did talk a little bit

2106
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:41,340
about RNA sequencing and the many

2107
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:44,310
technologies to do this get a limiting

2108
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:47,090
dilution put one one droplet per cell

2109
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:49,890
one well per cell all the concepts we've

2110
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:51,540
just talked about completely cold at the

2111
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:54,120
single cell level depth matters RNA

2112
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,680
sequencing is basically counting number

2113
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:58,110
of reads aligning each gene so really

2114
01:18:58,110 --> 01:19:00,240
there are many technological ways to get

2115
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,910
to genomics at single-cell resolution

2116
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:04,980
but all the ideas we've just talked

2117
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:09,120
about are basically exactly the same all

2118
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,820
those concepts genome doubling subclones

2119
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:14,100
coming going all that is now directly

2120
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:15,420
measurable with single cell sequencing

2121
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:19,260
this is one technology ten economics in

2122
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:20,700
this case there's basically a

2123
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:23,550
microfluidic chip in this case you have

2124
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,350
beads that contain here you have your

2125
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:27,450
cells you have beads that contain

2126
01:19:27,450 --> 01:19:29,490
reagents those both get encapsulated in

2127
01:19:29,490 --> 01:19:31,740
the oil droplet you then burst the cell

2128
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:33,690
and then you deliver those cells

2129
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:35,970
specific barcodes to the RNA for that

2130
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:38,400
for the individual cell so that gives

2131
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,580
you bar coded CT DNA and each of those

2132
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:42,900
barcodes is different so you can

2133
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:44,850
actually tell each cell differently from

2134
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:46,770
one another you then burst all the oil

2135
01:19:46,770 --> 01:19:48,510
droplets and sequence all the molecules

2136
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:50,940
in your in your mixture but now you have

2137
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:52,290
the benefit and that you can look at all

2138
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:53,790
those much your barcodes and map the

2139
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:56,700
Tartan a back to the individual cells

2140
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:58,440
you can still analyze this like

2141
01:19:58,440 --> 01:19:59,700
conventional RNA sequencing

2142
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:01,170
day-day just ignore the barcodes and

2143
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:02,910
treated as a bulk they have the

2144
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:04,200
additional ability to go much deeper

2145
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,120
into individual cells or individual

2146
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,970
populations I this is what the data look

2147
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:11,580
like so each dot is an RNA sequencing

2148
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:13,470
experiment so it's a single cell and

2149
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:16,520
essentially just like I showed on that

2150
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,810
star that heat map plot you can now

2151
01:20:18,810 --> 01:20:21,090
start to cluster these by by the

2152
01:20:21,090 --> 01:20:23,520
transcriptional similarity and then the

2153
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,350
biology essentially rather than looking

2154
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:27,900
at the bulk of the entire population you

2155
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:29,280
can start to drill into individual

2156
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,170
populations so if you circle out this

2157
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:33,840
population here topmost expressed genes

2158
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,880
are all related to the t-cell receptor

2159
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:38,070
complex only expressed by T cells

2160
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:40,020
essentially we infer that these are the

2161
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:42,480
T cell populations in this case a

2162
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,070
neutrophil population macrophage

2163
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:46,080
population you can essentially mark

2164
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,260
march through each of these populations

2165
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,540
essentially using marker genes from

2166
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:52,770
essentially previously published RNA

2167
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:54,510
seek data sets just like I showed with

2168
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:57,300
gtex earlier but now the the challenge

2169
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:59,640
of gtex is its bulk tissue and now we

2170
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:01,500
have a need for single cell reference

2171
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:04,170
sets as well you can do this in cancer

2172
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:06,000
so this is actually the same data just

2173
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,200
color it a different way so this is

2174
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,940
colored by its transcriptional identity

2175
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:11,280
this is colored by who donated the data

2176
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,990
so in this case this is a patient with

2177
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:15,390
multiple myeloma two huge clusters that

2178
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:17,550
are not in the normals and the two

2179
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:18,810
healthy's actually can see all the

2180
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:20,040
single cells are actually really nicely

2181
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:23,430
intermingling but none of the neither of

2182
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:25,650
those on those healthy donors have any

2183
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:27,630
of these two populations from the cancer

2184
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:29,580
patient so of course the punchline here

2185
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:30,870
is these are actually two very large

2186
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:32,520
cancer clones that are essentially

2187
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,500
present transcription indistinct in the

2188
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:37,650
same patient and the science question

2189
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:38,760
here was actually what happens these

2190
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:41,070
populations over time while they're on

2191
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:44,340
the clinical trial the caller ID the

2192
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:46,170
caller a question was what not just

2193
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:48,090
happens to the tumor cell populations

2194
01:21:48,090 --> 01:21:50,430
but also what happens to the healthy

2195
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:52,230
normal cells as well yes

2196
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:56,640
oh so tis knee is essentially a

2197
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:01,380
graphical representation of essentially

2198
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:03,120
relatedness between gene expression

2199
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:05,790
profiles so essentially the it's not

2200
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:07,230
perfect but sort of at the spatial

2201
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:11,640
representation of describe this it's

2202
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:11,960
just

2203
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,580
showing the relatedness between

2204
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:15,410
different gene expression profiles

2205
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:16,640
because if you think of all the

2206
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,950
different combinations use a huge table

2207
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:22,370
of 20,000 genes by however many cells be

2208
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:25,250
sequenced so a heat map is virtually

2209
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:26,600
unreadable because in all the

2210
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,100
relationships of all those cells and all

2211
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:30,050
those genes this is this a method to

2212
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:32,120
compress all that data into a 2d

2213
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:34,190
representation and there's actually new

2214
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:36,940
methods now that replaced Disney plots

2215
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:39,560
actually the method we used in that more

2216
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:41,410
now is called you map which is

2217
01:22:41,410 --> 01:22:43,460
essentially the distance between two

2218
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:46,150
dots is actually a measure of similarity

2219
01:22:46,150 --> 01:22:48,050
essentially it's a data visualization

2220
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:51,890
technique for similarity between two

2221
01:22:51,890 --> 01:22:53,840
cells I really think we need a whole

2222
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,489
workshop on single-cell michelle's

2223
01:22:55,489 --> 01:22:57,110
around there's probably I got an entire

2224
01:22:57,110 --> 01:22:58,940
week you can spend on the informatics of

2225
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:01,340
single cell analysis are you yes oh good

2226
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:06,650
Francis here yeah I definitely did not

2227
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:10,520
do the Disney plot justice but we'll all

2228
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,140
have to be ultra experts in this very

2229
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:14,989
soon and the other sort of call out to a

2230
01:23:14,989 --> 01:23:17,930
reference set in terms of single cell

2231
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:20,030
single cell reference the human cell

2232
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:22,130
atlas is a large international

2233
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:25,700
consortium to just like GTX capture all

2234
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:27,500
single cell data from around the world

2235
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,360
and put it for free on the internet

2236
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:31,310
without a password this actually has had

2237
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:33,140
some interesting patient consent issues

2238
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:34,940
how do you consent a patient to put all

2239
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:36,890
their single-cell data online but also

2240
01:23:36,890 --> 01:23:38,660
enormous Lee enabling because now you

2241
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:41,420
can do a tumor experiment or a tumor

2242
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:42,830
sequencing experiment and then compare

2243
01:23:42,830 --> 01:23:45,410
all the all those cells to a large Bank

2244
01:23:45,410 --> 01:23:47,960
of a healthy reference healthy reference

2245
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:50,420
cells as well this is also a great

2246
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:52,570
source of funding so founder of Facebook

2247
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:54,469
Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla

2248
01:23:54,469 --> 01:23:57,380
Chan are busily funding pilot projects

2249
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:59,960
in unusual cell types was cancer pilot

2250
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:02,300
that were active in really starting to

2251
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:03,410
build a lot of the infrastructure and

2252
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:05,420
reference sets needed to do single cell

2253
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:07,370
sequencing and I suspect within five

2254
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:08,900
years we'll start to see maybe even

2255
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:11,300
sooner some of the first clinical single

2256
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:12,890
cell readouts just because you really

2257
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:15,260
get this amazing view like we did here

2258
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:17,960
of to cancer clones directly and the

2259
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,520
ability to start mapping to be used to

2260
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:23,020
potential treatments as well

2261
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:25,280
okay so I'm getting in the last 30

2262
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,350
minutes I'll just give a quick overview

2263
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:29,480
of everything they talked about in

2264
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:31,880
genetics so far or in cancer genomics so

2265
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:34,130
far is influenced by the germline as

2266
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:36,500
well so going back to that same Thompson

2267
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:40,060
Thompson textbook really this idea of

2268
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:42,560
needing two hits and a tumor suppressor

2269
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,240
so essentially these are the breaks that

2270
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,760
essentially stop cells from cycling

2271
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:48,530
there's actually a large portion of

2272
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:50,510
cancer patients actually upwards of 10%

2273
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:52,970
or into some papers where patients are

2274
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:56,330
actually born with a loss of one of two

2275
01:24:56,330 --> 01:24:58,910
copies of the tumor suppressor gene and

2276
01:24:58,910 --> 01:25:00,560
what we found we sequencers tumors is

2277
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,300
there's almost always a second hit

2278
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:04,610
roughly half of those tumors have a

2279
01:25:04,610 --> 01:25:06,170
second hit and DNA

2280
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:08,000
I suspect we don't have data yet that

2281
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,530
the other half are likely epigenetic

2282
01:25:09,530 --> 01:25:12,080
modifications or structural changes but

2283
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,820
what's been really striking is the

2284
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:15,590
manner of that second hit is different

2285
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:16,070
every time

2286
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:18,020
sometimes it's mutation sometimes it's

2287
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:19,640
deletions sometimes rearrangement

2288
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:21,590
sometimes methylation and really the

2289
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:23,270
need specially in that ready for cancer

2290
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:24,770
space for techniques that look at

2291
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:28,760
multiple hits around multiple second

2292
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,470
hits especially when you know patients

2293
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:32,840
are already predisposed by one inherited

2294
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:35,930
variant and here's actually a good

2295
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:38,120
example from a pediatric cancer study in

2296
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:39,830
this case here's their normal sequencing

2297
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:41,090
reads this is just from a blood sample

2298
01:25:41,090 --> 01:25:44,090
you consider see by I hear every roughly

2299
01:25:44,090 --> 01:25:46,010
half the reads have this deletion and

2300
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:48,080
the other half are all intact so there's

2301
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,000
cell the normal cells are normal they

2302
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,970
still have one copy which allows normal

2303
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:54,710
cell development when you sequence the

2304
01:25:54,710 --> 01:25:57,740
tumor first of all we saw huge deletion

2305
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:59,630
all of chromosome ten so they basically

2306
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:01,400
used to have two copies and the antenna

2307
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:04,940
not they deleted the unmuting copy and

2308
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:06,800
then when you sequence the tumor every

2309
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,720
single read apart from maybe a few

2310
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,760
contaminating normal cells have that

2311
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,770
mutations really be able to compare both

2312
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:14,930
the germline state and the tumor state

2313
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:16,580
but also actually using the germline to

2314
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:18,410
sort of guide interpretation of the of

2315
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:22,160
the tumor genome so just to get us into

2316
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:26,120
the the case report I've talked a lot

2317
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:28,190
about finding stuff making lists of

2318
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:29,990
variants but the real challenging

2319
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:31,850
certainly least automated part is still

2320
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:33,980
that active genome interpretation so

2321
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:36,120
it's one thing to call all these parts

2322
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:38,010
but this is still the area where we need

2323
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:41,970
certainly better software better access

2324
01:26:41,970 --> 01:26:44,070
to reference sets start helping us

2325
01:26:44,070 --> 01:26:46,650
interpret specifically what a mutation

2326
01:26:46,650 --> 01:26:47,880
that we've never seen before

2327
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:50,370
maybe maybe doing within those cells and

2328
01:26:50,370 --> 01:26:52,200
that's really this act of how do you

2329
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,700
annotate a variant how do you interpret

2330
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:55,560
a variant then ultimately how do you

2331
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:57,860
report it out to guide patient care

2332
01:26:57,860 --> 01:26:59,850
there many ways to do it

2333
01:26:59,850 --> 01:27:02,010
their whole guidelines American College

2334
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:04,050
of medical genetics the College of

2335
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:05,940
American Pathologists their many

2336
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:07,500
guidelines for how to insure for the

2337
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:10,800
variants they work for a good fraction

2338
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,360
of them but there's really no one

2339
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:13,980
hotshot piece of software as you can

2340
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:15,720
tell from this this long list that

2341
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:18,540
essentially will be in a mutation as a

2342
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:23,220
driver or not a driver there are a few

2343
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:24,750
tools to do it there's one tool called

2344
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:26,400
angka Tator which will promote a huge

2345
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,710
list of all the variants of all the

2346
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:30,210
annotations or things that are nolan

2347
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:32,280
about that variant we also use variant

2348
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:34,440
effect predictor this is actually one I

2349
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:37,200
use more often now there's desktop

2350
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:38,610
software that basically put all that

2351
01:27:38,610 --> 01:27:39,930
data into context of all the other

2352
01:27:39,930 --> 01:27:42,810
mutations around it this is really still

2353
01:27:42,810 --> 01:27:44,760
a pretty manual process basically going

2354
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,500
through coming up with a hypothesis

2355
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,390
sometimes additional experiment around

2356
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:50,570
what we think an additional of what the

2357
01:27:50,570 --> 01:27:52,980
somatic mutation cuff never change or

2358
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:55,590
fusion is actually doing here's like to

2359
01:27:55,590 --> 01:27:57,480
one of the guidelines so here's ACMG and

2360
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,270
basically their goal is to bin in our

2361
01:28:00,270 --> 01:28:02,340
case a German variant as benign or

2362
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:04,680
pathogenic and what's the strength of

2363
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,300
the evidence for pathogenic so this is

2364
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:08,340
they're really great paper just to read

2365
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:09,800
through how people are thinking about

2366
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,940
interpretation of error of the variant

2367
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:14,970
and all the many different aspects of of

2368
01:28:14,970 --> 01:28:17,010
what is known but a variant to try to

2369
01:28:17,010 --> 01:28:19,260
link essentially to give that variant

2370
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:23,640
meaning the other challenge okay let's

2371
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:25,530
say we've figured out what we think a

2372
01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:27,030
mutation is this is actually a real

2373
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:28,920
clinical report from Princess Margaret

2374
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:31,590
in this case this mutations not overly

2375
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:33,480
convincing it's sort of what we often

2376
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:35,280
call aberrant about knowing significance

2377
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,530
it hasn't been seen very often sort of a

2378
01:28:37,530 --> 01:28:39,720
big piece of text that describes what we

2379
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:41,910
think we know about the variant the

2380
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:43,410
downside here this really does not scale

2381
01:28:43,410 --> 01:28:44,820
very well so she do whole exome

2382
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:46,890
sequencing you've got 40 of these things

2383
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:48,690
you're gonna write them all up probably

2384
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:50,180
not

2385
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:53,100
it's also a communication problem no one

2386
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:55,560
especially conditions running a clinic

2387
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:57,210
wants to just get a book of all your

2388
01:28:57,210 --> 01:28:59,400
very interpretations really we need more

2389
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,200
dynamic and much clearer ways to

2390
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:03,480
communicate scientific meaning for

2391
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:05,580
specific variants that we've uncovered I

2392
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:07,710
wanted her to do this as a see our

2393
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:09,360
project genie so essentially it's

2394
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:10,830
encouraging clinical labs from around

2395
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:12,780
the world put their molecular results

2396
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:14,580
but also the variant interpretation and

2397
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:17,220
clinical data all into one place just so

2398
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:18,780
we're not interpreting the same variants

2399
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:20,430
over and over but also coming up with

2400
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:22,290
practices for how to interpret and share

2401
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:26,130
variants either tool I'm very keen on as

2402
01:29:26,130 --> 01:29:28,410
this Cibao portals is a tool that was

2403
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:30,090
built for the Cancer Genome Atlas just

2404
01:29:30,090 --> 01:29:32,310
house all of the data but it's actually

2405
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:34,410
become very powerful now as we start to

2406
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:37,290
interpret individual cases so in this

2407
01:29:37,290 --> 01:29:38,820
case is in sort of the dashboards for a

2408
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:41,580
single patient from diagnosis all of

2409
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:43,290
their treatments subsequent tumors

2410
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:45,150
looking at the copy number changes the

2411
01:29:45,150 --> 01:29:47,220
mutations and then all the specific

2412
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:49,140
details welcome use mutations including

2413
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:50,940
the allele frequency over time it's

2414
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:52,590
really putting a huge wealth of data

2415
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:54,750
really into an interactive website so

2416
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:55,800
you can really start to look at these

2417
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,150
data and really go through that

2418
01:29:57,150 --> 01:29:59,600
interpretive process for a single case

2419
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,500
okay and that's what we're gonna do now

2420
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:04,140
is essentially go through how a single

2421
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:06,990
case was managed now almost I almost ten

2422
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:08,760
years ago now published if you want to

2423
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:11,160
read it great detail any questions on

2424
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:12,810
the background before we go into this

2425
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:18,930
case here okay so initial present so

2426
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:20,640
this is all just a single patient so

2427
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:21,930
everything we've talked about is basic

2428
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:23,610
context for interpreting this single

2429
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:27,030
case so 78 year-old man fit and active

2430
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:31,200
no real reason to have cancer no family

2431
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:34,620
history pretty large basically started

2432
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:36,410
off with throat discomfort came in

2433
01:30:36,410 --> 01:30:38,010
examination actually found a pretty

2434
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:39,690
large mass of basic attack so this is

2435
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:43,100
pretty big for head neck cancer

2436
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:47,370
nonsmoker no non drinker no real reason

2437
01:30:47,370 --> 01:30:50,160
for him to have this tumor but this is

2438
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:53,640
sort of how he arrived step one is a PET

2439
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:56,460
CT scan and a biopsy so they're always

2440
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:58,200
starting with the tissue first just to

2441
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,640
get a diagnosis and some understanding

2442
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:02,190
of what we're looking at here in this

2443
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:03,260
case

2444
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:05,880
positive the pet was positive for the

2445
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:08,190
lung mass itself also positive for the

2446
01:31:08,190 --> 01:31:09,480
draining lymph nodes as well so

2447
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:11,280
essentially this is already poor

2448
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,200
prognosis tumors now actually already

2449
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:14,850
started to metastasize or at least move

2450
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:18,150
to to nearby nodes this is usually a

2451
01:31:18,150 --> 01:31:19,710
test for the pathologist this is a very

2452
01:31:19,710 --> 01:31:22,290
rare a salivary gland tumor

2453
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:27,180
so using this AB no carcinoma very rare

2454
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:30,660
tumor no obvious clinical course or

2455
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:32,630
obvious treatment necessarily for these

2456
01:31:32,630 --> 01:31:34,980
beyond surgery so in his case he had

2457
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:36,960
surgery so ladies by section of both the

2458
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,960
tumor and the draining nodes primary as

2459
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:43,290
I said this micro papillary or ethnic

2460
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:44,520
arsenal of micro papillary mucinous

2461
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:46,800
features three of twenty one of the

2462
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,420
notes I took out multiple notes three of

2463
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,830
them are positive so this tumor is

2464
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:53,460
mobile head neck very common to have

2465
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:55,290
surgery and radiation so I got directed

2466
01:31:55,290 --> 01:31:57,060
therapy completed in February pretty

2467
01:31:57,060 --> 01:31:59,220
good quality of life for four months but

2468
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:01,350
then most concern me for him you know

2469
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:02,910
there's already hint that tumors mobile

2470
01:32:02,910 --> 01:32:05,370
he returned with numerous small on the

2471
01:32:05,370 --> 01:32:07,170
past Aziz in both lines so this is very

2472
01:32:07,170 --> 01:32:09,900
serious really trying to think of you

2473
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:11,670
can't do surgery Pinklon pick out each

2474
01:32:11,670 --> 01:32:13,260
of these nodes individually what

2475
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:15,480
systemic therapy might be appropriate

2476
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:18,240
for him so they're thinking clinical

2477
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:20,220
trial at that point metastatic disease

2478
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:23,100
both lungs are involved in this case

2479
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:24,540
they're looking for a clinical trial

2480
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:26,940
this is the age where EGFR had EGFR

2481
01:32:26,940 --> 01:32:29,730
mutations have just been described there

2482
01:32:29,730 --> 01:32:31,560
each of our clinical trial each of our

2483
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:33,120
inhibitors rather at the BC Cancer

2484
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,220
Agency available so I want to ask the

2485
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:38,100
question is EGFR expressed and it was

2486
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:39,810
kind of so we're looking for here our

2487
01:32:39,810 --> 01:32:42,600
brown spots so there's some tumor cells

2488
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:46,680
or expressing EGFR so what treatments

2489
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:48,960
are possible target EGFR therapy is

2490
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:51,870
maybe maybe warranted there wasn't sort

2491
01:32:51,870 --> 01:32:54,000
of a EGFR mutation service at that time

2492
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,530
so really just going purely on

2493
01:32:55,530 --> 01:32:57,720
expression he was put on an EGFR

2494
01:32:57,720 --> 01:32:59,460
inhibitor so in this case or a lot nib

2495
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:01,080
Tarceva

2496
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:03,270
and it really didn't work at all so each

2497
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:04,830
if our expression alone was not enough

2498
01:33:04,830 --> 01:33:06,600
to respond to this so in this case all

2499
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:09,000
the lung Mets grew while on the tumor

2500
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,220
the largest lesion really grew this is

2501
01:33:11,220 --> 01:33:13,890
really looking pretty serious they got

2502
01:33:13,890 --> 01:33:15,469
them off that drug right away there's

2503
01:33:15,469 --> 01:33:18,530
reason for it not to work but now

2504
01:33:18,530 --> 01:33:19,789
they're really thinking palliative care

2505
01:33:19,789 --> 01:33:22,610
what next like this really rare tumor

2506
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:27,289
there's no obvious molecular like test

2507
01:33:27,289 --> 01:33:30,349
to order for these tumors so here's sort

2508
01:33:30,349 --> 01:33:31,729
of his timeline down here

2509
01:33:31,729 --> 01:33:33,229
sort of really thinking or a lot and it

2510
01:33:33,229 --> 01:33:35,869
was failed what do we do next so this

2511
01:33:35,869 --> 01:33:37,909
goes back to that other slide it's great

2512
01:33:37,909 --> 01:33:39,349
to have the landscape of tumors what are

2513
01:33:39,349 --> 01:33:41,090
the targets in an individual case

2514
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:43,309
so exhaustion standard of care turned to

2515
01:33:43,309 --> 01:33:45,289
the GSC for new leads they had a special

2516
01:33:45,289 --> 01:33:48,199
re B and this is really something I do

2517
01:33:48,199 --> 01:33:50,030
for every single project is specialist

2518
01:33:50,030 --> 01:33:52,130
come bring samples what has the patients

2519
01:33:52,130 --> 01:33:54,349
have the patient's consented to can they

2520
01:33:54,349 --> 01:33:56,210
be shared can they be analyzed in a

2521
01:33:56,210 --> 01:33:58,670
specific way in this case they had a an

2522
01:33:58,670 --> 01:34:01,460
N of 1 re B meeting will do X on when I

2523
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:03,769
our whole genome and RNA sequencing with

2524
01:34:03,769 --> 01:34:06,199
the goal to nominate essentially

2525
01:34:06,199 --> 01:34:07,639
potential treatments so it's not a

2526
01:34:07,639 --> 01:34:10,219
diagnostic test but really make sure the

2527
01:34:10,219 --> 01:34:11,780
re B and the patient is really on board

2528
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:13,969
and the patient consented the for

2529
01:34:13,969 --> 01:34:15,380
genomic sequencing really convened it

2530
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:18,920
came to him that it's not a diagnostic

2531
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:20,210
test essentially this is an animal on

2532
01:34:20,210 --> 01:34:24,920
research project I mean Vancouver has

2533
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:27,079
done nearly a thousand cases this is

2534
01:34:27,079 --> 01:34:29,059
essentially pod zero so the very first

2535
01:34:29,059 --> 01:34:31,639
case that they ever did I don't know if

2536
01:34:31,639 --> 01:34:34,099
it's scalable in its current form that

2537
01:34:34,099 --> 01:34:36,489
interpretive process really needs to be

2538
01:34:36,489 --> 01:34:38,989
quasi on made it or just needs a big

2539
01:34:38,989 --> 01:34:40,820
skilled team to work and in a

2540
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:42,559
coordinated way around so I think

2541
01:34:42,559 --> 01:34:45,800
actually it is it's just gotta be big

2542
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:53,749
big scale for it to be real uh I think

2543
01:34:53,749 --> 01:34:55,820
that every patient is not especially in

2544
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:57,229
today's landscape is not something you

2545
01:34:57,229 --> 01:34:59,179
would do I think now there are many

2546
01:34:59,179 --> 01:35:01,010
molecular profiling programs like this

2547
01:35:01,010 --> 01:35:02,869
that sequence thousands of patients and

2548
01:35:02,869 --> 01:35:04,460
now they're just like a protocols to do

2549
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:06,710
this so I think now you know that was

2550
01:35:06,710 --> 01:35:08,690
almost ten years ago I'm not sure

2551
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:11,420
profiling the whole culture and

2552
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:12,829
landscape has really changed

2553
01:35:12,829 --> 01:35:15,829
so really a central re be to do large

2554
01:35:15,829 --> 01:35:17,210
high-throughput profiling an

2555
01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:19,820
interpretation is it's it's being done

2556
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:22,329
already

2557
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:28,270
I think it's still a challenge for

2558
01:35:28,270 --> 01:35:30,160
communicator the patient your data will

2559
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:34,000
be shared and how so it's opened up all

2560
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,950
these new interesting nuances not so

2561
01:35:35,950 --> 01:35:38,320
much for the individual patient but for

2562
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:43,330
Sir data sharing more broadly yeah that

2563
01:35:43,330 --> 01:35:46,900
would be great okay so we also took that

2564
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:49,590
so her latinum had failed

2565
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:53,410
let's try comprehensive profiling so in

2566
01:35:53,410 --> 01:35:55,270
this case a fresh frozen biopsy was

2567
01:35:55,270 --> 01:35:57,160
taken specifically for RNA sequencing

2568
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:58,360
and the whole genome sequencing so

2569
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:00,600
here's the CT scan a pretty big mass

2570
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:03,070
pathology review again very high tumor

2571
01:36:03,070 --> 01:36:04,750
content so pathologist reviewed all the

2572
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:07,780
cells 80% tumor content great so we know

2573
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:09,610
the vast or the the gene expression

2574
01:36:09,610 --> 01:36:11,560
profiles will be highly enriched for

2575
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:13,960
cancer cells good news and we also had

2576
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:15,130
this formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded

2577
01:36:15,130 --> 01:36:17,170
DNA for the whole genome sequencing

2578
01:36:17,170 --> 01:36:19,660
works so here's what the whole genome

2579
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:22,300
sequencing analysis found p53 very

2580
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:24,760
famous tumor suppressor mutated in half

2581
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:28,660
of all tumors that surprising RB loss of

2582
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:30,100
function mutation very interesting in

2583
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:32,080
this patients case because loss of RB

2584
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:35,230
results in EGFR inhibitor resistance so

2585
01:36:35,230 --> 01:36:36,970
had we known this mutation was there

2586
01:36:36,970 --> 01:36:39,490
previously he would have never gone on

2587
01:36:39,490 --> 01:36:40,840
that erlotinib trial and this is now

2588
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:42,670
actually an excluder for patients to go

2589
01:36:42,670 --> 01:36:44,590
on those trials it's really the need to

2590
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:46,930
get profiling early and of course like

2591
01:36:46,930 --> 01:36:48,760
you're always gonna get with broad

2592
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:51,100
profiling mutations in two genes I've

2593
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:52,720
never seen before I know if I've seen

2594
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,400
them since variants of unknown

2595
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:57,310
significance very helpful as you start

2596
01:36:57,310 --> 01:36:58,960
to pile up thousands of these patients

2597
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:00,460
because you can ask the question do we

2598
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:02,470
see these mutations mutated and preach

2599
01:37:02,470 --> 01:37:04,630
or these genes mutated in appreciable

2600
01:37:04,630 --> 01:37:07,450
frequency or not not overly relevant to

2601
01:37:07,450 --> 01:37:09,870
drugs at least at that point in time and

2602
01:37:09,870 --> 01:37:12,520
and both essentially all four of these

2603
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:14,320
mutations were confirmed by a different

2604
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:15,820
sequencing method I showed PacBio

2605
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:18,570
earlier Sanger sequencing for this study

2606
01:37:18,570 --> 01:37:20,800
essentially showing that these mutations

2607
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:24,210
who are truly there in the DNA so

2608
01:37:24,210 --> 01:37:26,260
essentially not a lot they're

2609
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:28,390
therapeutically beyond explaining the

2610
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:31,050
treatment failure

2611
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:34,440
so it's a mutation that introduces an

2612
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:36,900
artificial stop codon so essentially it

2613
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:40,200
tells the transcript or the essentially

2614
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:43,470
a the transcript tells the protein

2615
01:37:43,470 --> 01:37:45,090
basically not to continue beyond that

2616
01:37:45,090 --> 01:37:47,280
that site so essentially it stops at

2617
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,140
2:34 it should be much much longer for

2618
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:51,930
IV and we infer that as loss of function

2619
01:37:51,930 --> 01:37:54,090
because you've lost power for some large

2620
01:37:54,090 --> 01:37:59,190
chunk of the protein just like before

2621
01:37:59,190 --> 01:38:02,190
here's circo's your the the chromosomes

2622
01:38:02,190 --> 01:38:04,620
around the outside in this case the this

2623
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:06,270
little track here colors copy number

2624
01:38:06,270 --> 01:38:08,040
changes so greens are lost Reds are

2625
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:10,260
gained so you can see EGFR amplification

2626
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:12,360
perhaps linked to the over expression

2627
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:14,520
they saw by IHC so it's over expressed

2628
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:16,890
but also had this undermining RB

2629
01:38:16,890 --> 01:38:20,040
mutation loss of p10 also associated

2630
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:22,080
with resistance to EGFR inhibitors so

2631
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,040
you have this double whammy

2632
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:25,530
EGFR was not ever gonna work very

2633
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:27,270
interesting amplification of ret

2634
01:38:27,270 --> 01:38:28,860
actually highly how you focal very hard

2635
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:31,620
to see here but full complications very

2636
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:32,910
interesting because the thinking is

2637
01:38:32,910 --> 01:38:35,130
they're focused on and relatively few

2638
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:37,020
genes read also interesting druggable

2639
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:39,860
target map case that pathways likely

2640
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:43,890
likely over expressed loss of p53 so in

2641
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:45,540
this case is a mutation and the deletion

2642
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:47,850
of p53 helpful for understanding a

2643
01:38:47,850 --> 01:38:49,230
biology but it's not really a direct

2644
01:38:49,230 --> 01:38:52,440
clinical path at least at that point for

2645
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:57,780
p53 mutant tumors there's no I'm just

2646
01:38:57,780 --> 01:38:59,820
like permutation using fish to confirm

2647
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:02,010
those copy number changes so lhasa p10

2648
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:04,470
that focal rat amplification many many

2649
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:07,350
copies of ret in these cells really

2650
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:08,490
showing the genomics being cross

2651
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:10,790
validated by a cell based method and

2652
01:39:10,790 --> 01:39:12,990
then the gene expression how do we

2653
01:39:12,990 --> 01:39:14,850
compare RNA sequencing especially at

2654
01:39:14,850 --> 01:39:16,440
that time we didn't have gtex there

2655
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:18,300
weren't a lot of reference sets so

2656
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:19,890
essentially the GSC they just took a

2657
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:21,900
mixed bag of fifty tumors and they

2658
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:23,190
actually I happen to have a blood sample

2659
01:39:23,190 --> 01:39:25,500
and they just said what is unusual in

2660
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:28,110
this RNA sequencing profile are their

2661
01:39:28,110 --> 01:39:29,940
genes that are abnormally expressed to

2662
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:32,370
an extraordinarily high level that could

2663
01:39:32,370 --> 01:39:34,320
be after the pond or could be could be

2664
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,450
inhibited therapeutically

2665
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:38,130
so in this case they saw a deletion of

2666
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:41,250
CeMAT for totally consistent with under

2667
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:42,900
expression specifically of that gene

2668
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:43,920
sense

2669
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,270
rat had that

2670
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:47,460
amplification and it was enormous Lehigh

2671
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:49,770
so cross that entire compendium of

2672
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:52,200
tumors it was 34 times higher than the

2673
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:54,510
next highest the next highest specimen

2674
01:39:54,510 --> 01:39:56,580
and was the most highly expressed uncle

2675
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:58,170
gene very interesting in this case

2676
01:39:58,170 --> 01:39:59,730
because this is something that could

2677
01:39:59,730 --> 01:40:01,950
potentially be acted upon and p10 was

2678
01:40:01,950 --> 01:40:03,690
deleted and it was one of the lowest

2679
01:40:03,690 --> 01:40:05,370
across the entire compendium so really

2680
01:40:05,370 --> 01:40:06,570
they're very powerful having that

2681
01:40:06,570 --> 01:40:08,790
reference set and mapping the individual

2682
01:40:08,790 --> 01:40:12,260
patients profile to that reference

2683
01:40:12,710 --> 01:40:15,420
GSU's now become famous for mapping or

2684
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:17,100
basically communicating biology using

2685
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:18,780
these these pathway diagrams so

2686
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:20,550
essentially here's the rat pathway

2687
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:22,500
annotated with copy number changes and

2688
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:24,690
gene expression changes rat both

2689
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:27,360
amplified and overexpressed resulting in

2690
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:29,489
over expression of the downstream

2691
01:40:29,489 --> 01:40:31,680
pathway and as you'd expect and then not

2692
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:33,090
a lot of action necessarily here in this

2693
01:40:33,090 --> 01:40:35,460
in this parallel path way beyond loss

2694
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:37,560
and down regulation of p10 so P dens a

2695
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:39,690
negative regulator of this pathway so

2696
01:40:39,690 --> 01:40:41,580
clearly this pathway is very important

2697
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:44,070
to the specific tumor really only

2698
01:40:44,070 --> 01:40:46,050
evident because you've measured both

2699
01:40:46,050 --> 01:40:48,780
mutation copy number and expression for

2700
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:50,610
every every member in this pathway so

2701
01:40:50,610 --> 01:40:51,840
you're not just dependent on a single

2702
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,280
gene test you're able to see the whole

2703
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,190
constellation of things that are

2704
01:40:55,190 --> 01:40:57,120
essentially converging on this one

2705
01:40:57,120 --> 01:41:00,150
pathway so here's the list so here's

2706
01:41:00,150 --> 01:41:01,950
sort of biology over here upregulation

2707
01:41:01,950 --> 01:41:04,230
map k rat is important so on and so

2708
01:41:04,230 --> 01:41:07,050
forth and what drugs are these map to in

2709
01:41:07,050 --> 01:41:08,600
this case actually came up with four

2710
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:12,360
potential for potential drugs its total

2711
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:15,090
hypothesis hypothesis being at K and

2712
01:41:15,090 --> 01:41:17,489
ranch are the drivers of this tumor to

2713
01:41:17,489 --> 01:41:19,590
test it there's basically four potential

2714
01:41:19,590 --> 01:41:21,360
treatments and really it was up to the

2715
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:23,460
oncologist here it's really provide

2716
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:25,380
using genomics as a tool to help guide

2717
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:28,170
clinical care and ultimately was up to

2718
01:41:28,170 --> 01:41:33,540
her to to choose so genome sequencing

2719
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:34,860
and RNA sequencing still doesn't happen

2720
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:36,660
overnight this took a whole month so

2721
01:41:36,660 --> 01:41:39,180
here's basically the day the biopsy was

2722
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:41,460
taken two not two masses pretty large

2723
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:45,390
took a whole month tumor continued to

2724
01:41:45,390 --> 01:41:49,680
grow from 22 to 27 24 28 from that list

2725
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:51,719
the oncologist essentially chose Sinitta

2726
01:41:51,719 --> 01:41:54,510
nib mostly because the the side effects

2727
01:41:54,510 --> 01:41:55,500
were at least the worst side effect

2728
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:57,160
reported first met in a mess

2729
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:59,020
with just the skin rash sort of felt

2730
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:01,000
that was tolerable in the context of a

2731
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,550
research protocol so started on October

2732
01:42:03,550 --> 01:42:05,770
29th and actually worked dramatically

2733
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:07,930
well so four weeks later significant

2734
01:42:07,930 --> 01:42:10,570
shrinkage of this tumor actually above

2735
01:42:10,570 --> 01:42:15,180
both legions 27 to 22 and 28 down to 21

2736
01:42:15,180 --> 01:42:17,740
and it's actually stabilized for seven

2737
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:19,510
months there was a relatively robust

2738
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:22,300
response there was some side-effects I

2739
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:24,540
reduced the dose continued to have

2740
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:26,500
stabilization of disease most

2741
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:28,390
importantly no new nodules and the

2742
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:30,010
nodules aren't growing at least during

2743
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:32,530
those seven months but as I foreshadowed

2744
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:34,000
on one of the first slides of the entire

2745
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,070
talk monotherapy works for only a short

2746
01:42:36,070 --> 01:42:37,960
period of time there's really the

2747
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:40,420
likelihood for resistance exactly the

2748
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:41,740
same story here you sorta kept the

2749
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:42,970
stabilization you're beating back the

2750
01:42:42,970 --> 01:42:45,940
tumour but then these Mets again begin

2751
01:42:45,940 --> 01:42:49,720
to grow either due to us a sub clonal

2752
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:52,390
selection some ships specifically in the

2753
01:42:52,390 --> 01:42:55,570
existing clones many possible molecular

2754
01:42:55,570 --> 01:42:58,810
ways that this could have happened but

2755
01:42:58,810 --> 01:43:00,190
since but they did have other options

2756
01:43:00,190 --> 01:43:01,690
they didn't switch to the combination of

2757
01:43:01,690 --> 01:43:03,370
two of the other drugs at wrong on that

2758
01:43:03,370 --> 01:43:05,590
list and again the Z stabilized now

2759
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:07,150
fitting that those pathways from a

2760
01:43:07,150 --> 01:43:09,130
different angle resulted in disease

2761
01:43:09,130 --> 01:43:10,720
stabilization and again another

2762
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:14,110
continuation for three months like you

2763
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:17,020
know the punchline really cancers are

2764
01:43:17,020 --> 01:43:18,970
dynamic and changing over time the exact

2765
01:43:18,970 --> 01:43:21,130
same story here recurrent disease again

2766
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:23,080
after those seven months and most

2767
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:25,840
currently most concerning the recurrent

2768
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,940
disease at the yep evasive tongue so

2769
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:29,700
essentially that primary has come back

2770
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:31,780
potentially either and that metastatic

2771
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:33,520
disease have traveled back to that a

2772
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:36,010
permissive microbiome mental niche or

2773
01:43:36,010 --> 01:43:37,480
potentially just residual disease

2774
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:40,060
remaining after surgery potentially more

2775
01:43:40,060 --> 01:43:42,760
likely especially now that the tumor has

2776
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:46,450
now grown at the tongue a new meso skin

2777
01:43:46,450 --> 01:43:48,550
nodule is now growing progressive and

2778
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:51,040
new metastases in life so really by

2779
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,240
forcing these tumors through the

2780
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:54,640
bottleneck they've essentially become

2781
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:57,550
resistance to treatment against this the

2782
01:43:57,550 --> 01:44:00,040
red pathway quality of life is getting

2783
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:01,510
worse of course the question is what

2784
01:44:01,510 --> 01:44:03,070
changed and again what can you do about

2785
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:03,780
it

2786
01:44:03,780 --> 01:44:06,640
so there's large neck mass this is now a

2787
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:09,130
chance to very easily accesible disease

2788
01:44:09,130 --> 01:44:10,770
you know essentially

2789
01:44:10,770 --> 01:44:12,870
to that site you can see many more

2790
01:44:12,870 --> 01:44:14,550
mutations and we saw the first time so

2791
01:44:14,550 --> 01:44:15,630
you saw all the mutations you saw

2792
01:44:15,630 --> 01:44:16,440
previously

2793
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:18,840
but these additional mutations none of

2794
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:21,810
which really are hotshot clinical trial

2795
01:44:21,810 --> 01:44:23,640
is not really a kinase that you could

2796
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:25,470
really go after I've never seen these

2797
01:44:25,470 --> 01:44:27,510
mutations before none of these are

2798
01:44:27,510 --> 01:44:29,520
evidence in the pretreatment biopsy the

2799
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:31,380
by tree treatment was a sequence - of

2800
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:33,660
gigantic depth but really not even one

2801
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:35,190
reads supporting the presence of these

2802
01:44:35,190 --> 01:44:39,420
mutations doing the exact same analysis

2803
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:40,620
I just showed earlier you can see

2804
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:42,810
there's a lot more red on this slide so

2805
01:44:42,810 --> 01:44:45,210
essentially the tumors way to to

2806
01:44:45,210 --> 01:44:47,190
overcome this treatment was just to amp

2807
01:44:47,190 --> 01:44:49,980
up ret signaling and to turn up this

2808
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:53,040
this parallel pathway as well so p10

2809
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:54,180
still lost but you can see over

2810
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:56,160
expression of additional pathway members

2811
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:58,610
but also this parallel pathway also

2812
01:44:58,610 --> 01:45:01,290
responding by due to increased copy

2813
01:45:01,290 --> 01:45:02,820
number state but also increased gene

2814
01:45:02,820 --> 01:45:06,090
expression level as well and this is

2815
01:45:06,090 --> 01:45:09,140
really where it gets extraordinarily

2816
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:12,000
experimental is it now cocktail drugs

2817
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,680
against all these pathway members the

2818
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:16,500
disease is very advanced of course at a

2819
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:18,390
major risk of adverse side effects you

2820
01:45:18,390 --> 01:45:20,000
can't just go grabbing three or four

2821
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,070
drugs and deliver them to patients could

2822
01:45:23,070 --> 01:45:24,300
we have found these resistance

2823
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:26,310
mechanisms pretreatment perhaps in

2824
01:45:26,310 --> 01:45:28,530
today's environment could cell free DNA

2825
01:45:28,530 --> 01:45:30,480
have been used to detect resistance

2826
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:33,480
earlier than it was and could we have

2827
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:35,040
actually modeled and monitored these

2828
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:37,820
over time so especially to get long

2829
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:40,680
additional longitudinal data there's a

2830
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:41,910
real potential now to start learning

2831
01:45:41,910 --> 01:45:43,830
from metastatic disease and then go back

2832
01:45:43,830 --> 01:45:45,120
to the primaries unless four mechanisms

2833
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:48,120
of resistance early on and unfortunately

2834
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:50,190
yeah he actually passed away soon after

2835
01:45:50,190 --> 01:45:53,700
that just all the alike continue to to

2836
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:55,950
decline here sort of his entire timeline

2837
01:45:55,950 --> 01:45:58,770
so essentially buying him just over an

2838
01:45:58,770 --> 01:46:01,110
additional year of good quality of life

2839
01:46:01,110 --> 01:46:03,240
but really that that problem that still

2840
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:04,980
stands today is very challenging to

2841
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:07,250
interpret deliver and act upon the

2842
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:16,230
clinical genome and RNA seek yeah I mean

2843
01:46:16,230 --> 01:46:17,790
this is one certain path I'm very

2844
01:46:17,790 --> 01:46:18,780
interested in this area from the

2845
01:46:18,780 --> 01:46:20,490
single-cell approach as well doing some

2846
01:46:20,490 --> 01:46:22,290
of that pre post treatment modeling both

2847
01:46:22,290 --> 01:46:22,820
of my

2848
01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:24,710
I earn mint tumor clones I think this is

2849
01:46:24,710 --> 01:46:26,630
sort of the next big data boom

2850
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:29,020
especially is ranked comprehensive data

2851
01:46:29,020 --> 01:46:31,430
become available on more and more tumors

2852
01:46:31,430 --> 01:46:33,590
but yeah when I say modeling there are

2853
01:46:33,590 --> 01:46:34,760
many ways there's patient-derived

2854
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:36,680
xenograft there's cell lines whose brain

2855
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:38,510
tumor stem cells

2856
01:46:38,510 --> 01:46:40,880
I think certainly infrastructure is much

2857
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,680
better now getting serial samples like

2858
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:44,690
this and this now really are those

2859
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:46,820
experiments that can be done using real

2860
01:46:46,820 --> 01:46:57,260
patient-derived yeah I mean there's been

2861
01:46:57,260 --> 01:46:58,880
a lot of that work I haven't seen like a

2862
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:00,860
prospective clinical trial that's shown

2863
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:03,620
this beautiful can't-miss kind of test

2864
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:05,390
but it's certainly an area of intense

2865
01:47:05,390 --> 01:47:09,320
research for sure and that's pretty much

2866
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:12,130
the end of my talk so I'm
