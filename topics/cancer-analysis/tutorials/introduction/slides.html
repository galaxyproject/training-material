# Cancer cells accumulate somatic alterations over time

![](images/CAN_Module1_Lecture-10_1.jpg)

- Mutation frequency depends on cancer type
- External forces (e.g. drug treatment) can select for specific
clones (e.g. cells with resistance mutations)

# Reasons for molecular testing for cancer

<br/><br/>

## Treatment

treatment susceptibility, predict adverse side-effects, watch-and-wait versus aggressive treatment


## Drug resistance and metabolism

pre-existing resistance mutations, drug dosage


## Inherited cancer syndromes

additional primary tumors, at-risk family members


## Prognosis

molecular subtyping, benign vs. malignant,
determine unknown primary, predict metastatic potential

---

# What are the targets in *my* cancer…

<br/><br/>

- Sequence**:  Mutations, polymorphisms

- **Structure:** Copy number variation, translocation, loss-of-heterozygosity

- **Function:** Expression, exon-usage

- **External:** Viruses, bacteria

BRAF is recurrently mutated in ovarian cancers, but is rarely mutated in high grade serous carcinoma (mycancergenome.org). The most common variant found in ovarian tumours is p.V600E (mycancergenome.org). Currently, the impact of this mutation on patient prognosis or treatment in this tumour site is unknown.
