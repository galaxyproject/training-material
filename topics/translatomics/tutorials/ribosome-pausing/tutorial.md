# Introduction

<!-- This is a comment. -->

Ribosome profiling is an extremely creative extention for next-generation sequencing technology, in which we should not only obtain the information of gene expression at the translational level. Hence, more valuable information about gene regulation waiting to be explored by us. Even the disadvantages existed in the ribosome profiling can be used to infer gene regulation. For example, the short read length and heterogeneity of read distribution seem as unavoidable shortcomings in ribosome profiling. However, it is these characteristics that allow us to infer the position of the ribosome pausing during translation, and then make reasonable predictions and explanations of gene regulation and physiological phenomena with a higher level of resolution. 

Then, what are the causes of ribosome pausing or even stalling? 

Previous studies have shown that the reasons for this phenomenon can be explained in two main aspects: first, the secondary structure of mRNA hinders the sliding of ribosomes; second, the inventory of cognate tRNA for certain codons is scarcity, leading to ribosome pausing.

# Conclusion

{:.no_toc}

There is plenty of information hidden in the translatomics data waiting for us to mine, in which we can infer the landscape of gene expression more accurately, thereby explaining the regulatory mechanisms more reasonablely.
