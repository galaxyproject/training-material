### Advantages & Limitations

1. Advantages
	- Precise positional information (sub-codon level)
	- Snap-shot of translation

2. Limitations
	- The step for inhibiting translation is sensitive and complicated.
	- It is difficult to align reads in the repetitive or highly similar regions.

### Applications

1. Identifying the translational start site

2. Estimating the rate of protein synthesis

3. Identifying open reading frames

4. Calculating translational efficiency

5. Examining ribosome pausing
