                <p>Advances in sequencing technologies over the last few decades have revolutionized the field of genomics, allowing for a reduction in both the time and resources required to perform <em>de novo</em> genome assembly. Until recently, second-generation sequencing technologies (also known as next generation sequencing (NGS)) produced highly accurate but short (up to 800bp) reads. These read lengths were not long enough to cope with the difficulties associated with repetitive regions. Today, so-called third-generation sequencing (TGS) technologies, also known as single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, have become dominant in <em>de novo</em> assembly of large genomes. TGS can use native DNA without amplification, reducing sequencing error and bias (<span class="citation"><a href="#Hon2020">Hon <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#Giani2020">Giani <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>). In 2020, PacBio introduced high fidelity (HiFi) sequencing, which produces reads 10-25 kbp in length with a minimum accuracy of 99% (Q20). In this tutorial, you will use HiFi reads in combination with data from additional sequencing technologies to generate a high-quality genome assembly.</p>

<p>Deciphering the structural organization of complex vertebrate genomes is currently one of the largest challenges in genomics (<span class="citation"><a href="#Frenkel2012">Frenkel <i>et al.</i> 2012</a></span>). Despite the significant progress made in recent years, a key question remains: what combination of data and tools can produce the highest quality assembly? In order to adequately answer this question, it is necessary to analyse two of the main factors that determine the difficulty of genome assembly processes: repetitive content and heterozygosity.</p>

<p>Repetitive elements can be grouped into two categories: interspersed repeats, such as transposable elements (TE) that occur at multiple loci throughout the genome, and tandem repeats (TR) that occur at a single locus (<span class="citation"><a href="#Trresen2019">Tørresen <i>et al.</i> 2019</a></span>). Repetitive elements are an important component of eukaryotic genomes, constituting over a third of the genome in the case of mammals (<span class="citation"><a href="#SoteroCaio2017">Sotero-Caio <i>et al.</i> 2017</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#Chalopin2015">Chalopin <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>). In the case of tandem repeats, various estimates suggest that they are present in at least one third of human protein sequences (<span class="citation"><a href="#Marcotte1999">Marcotte <i>et al.</i> 1999</a></span>). <abbr title="transposable elements">TE</abbr> content is among the main factors contributing to the lack of continuity in the reconstruction of genomes, especially in the case of large ones, as TE content is highly correlated with genome size (<span class="citation"><a href="#SoteroCaio2017">Sotero-Caio <i>et al.</i> 2017</a></span>). On the other hand, <abbr title="tandem repeats">TR</abbr> usually lead to local genome assembly collapse, especially when their length is close to that of the reads (<span class="citation"><a href="#Trresen2019">Tørresen <i>et al.</i> 2019</a></span>).</p>

<p>Heterozygosity is also an important factor impacting genome assembly. Haplotype phasing, the identification of alleles that are co-located on the same chromosome, has become a fundamental problem in heterozygous and polyploid genome assemblies (<span class="citation"><a href="#Zhang2020">Zhang <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>). When no reference sequence is available, the state-of-the-art strategy consists of constructing a string graph with vertices representing reads and edges representing consistent overlaps. In this kind of graph, after transitive reduction, heterozygous alleles in the string graph are represented by bubbles. When combined with all-versus-all chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) data, this approach allows complete diploid reconstruction (<span class="citation"><a href="#DominguezDelAngel2018">Angel <i>et al.</i> 2018</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#Zhang2020">Zhang <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#Dida2021">Dida and Yi 2021</a></span>).</p>

<p>The Genome 10K consortium (G10K) launched the Vertebrate Genome Project (Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP)), whose goal is generating high-quality, near-error-free, gap-free, chromosome-level, haplotype-phased, annotated reference genome assemblies for every vertebrate species (<span class="citation"><a href="#Rhie2021">Rhie <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>). This tutorial will guide you step by step to assemble a high-quality genome using the VGP assembly pipeline, including multiple Quality Control (QC) evaluations.</p>

<h1 id="important-terms-to-know">Important terms to know</h1>

<p>Before getting into the thick of things, let’s go over some terms you will often hear when learning about genome assembly. These concepts will be used often throughout this tutorial as well, so please refer to this section as necessary to help your understanding.</p>

<p><strong>Pseudohaplotype assembly</strong>: A genome assembly that consists of long-phased haplotype blocks separated by regions where the haplotype cannot be distinguished (often homozygous regions). This can result in “switch errors”, when the parental haplotypes alternate along the same sequence. These types of assemblies are usually represented by a <em>primary assembly</em> and an <em>alternate assembly</em>. (This definition is largely taken from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/model/#asmb_def">NCBI’s Genome Assembly Model</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>Primary assembly</strong>: The primary assembly is traditionally the more complete representation of an individual’s genome and consists of homozygous regions and one set of loci for heterozygous regions. Because the primary assembly contains both homo- and heterozygous regions, it is more complete than the <em>alternate assambly</em> which often reports only the other allele for heterozygous regions. Thus, the primary assembly is usually what one would use for downstream analyses.</p>

<p><strong>Alternate assembly</strong>: The alternate assembly consists of the alternate alleles not represented in the <em>primary assembly</em> (heterozygous loci from the other haplotype). These types of sequences are often referred to as haplotigs. Traditionally, the alternate assembly is less complete compared to the primary assembly since homozygous regions are not represented.</p>

<p><strong>Phasing</strong>: Phasing aims to partition the contigs for an individual according to the haplotype they are derived from. When parental data is available, this is done by identifying parental alleles using read data from the parents. Locally, this is achieved using linkage information in long read datasets. Recent approaches have managed to phase using long-range <abbr title="all-versus-all chromatin conformation capture">Hi-C</abbr> linkage information from the same individual (<span class="citation"><a href="#Cheng2021">Cheng <i>et al.</i> 2021</a></span>).</p>

<p><strong>Assembly graph</strong>: A representation of the genome inferred from sequencing reads. Sequencing captures the genome as many fragmented pieces, instead of whole entire chromosomes at once (we eagerly await the day when this statement will be outdated!). The start of the assembly process pieces together these genome fragments to generate an assembly graph, which is a representation of the sequences and their overlaps. Visualizing assembly graphs can show where homozygous regions branch off into alternate paths on different haplotypes.</p>

<p><strong>Unitig</strong>: Usually the smallest unit of an assembly graph, consistent with all the available sequencing data. A unitig is often constructed from an unambiguous path in the assembly graph where all the vertices have exactly one incoming and one outgoing edge, except the first vertex can have any number of incoming edges, while the last vertex can have any number of outgoing edges (<span class="citation"><a href="#Rahman2022">Rahman and Medvedev 2022</a></span>). In other words, the internal vertices in the unitig path can only be walked one way, so unitigs represent a path of confident sequence. In the assembly graph, unitig nodes can then have overlap edges with other unitigs.</p>

<p><strong>Contig</strong>: A contiguous (<em>i.e.</em>, gapless) sequence in an assembly, usually inferred algorithmically from the unitig graph.</p>

<p><strong>False duplications</strong>: Assembly errors that result in one region of the genome being represented twice in the same assembly as two separate regions. Not to be confused with optical or technical duplicates from PCR from short-read sequencing. False duplications can further be classified as either <em>haplotypic duplications</em> or <em>overlaps</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Haplotypic duplication</strong> can happen when a region that is heterozygous in the individual has the two haplotypes showing enough divergence that the assembler fails to interpret them as homologous. For example, say an individual is heterozygous in the region Chr1[1:100] and has Haplotype A from their mother and Haplotype B from their father; a false duplication can arise when the haplotypes are not recognized as being from the same region, and the assembler ends up placing both haplotypes in the same assembly, resulting in Chr1[1:100] being represented twice in one assembly. Ideally, a properly phased assembly would have Haplotype A in one assembly, <em>e.g.</em>, the primary, while Haplotype B is in the alternate.</p>

<p>False duplications via <strong>overlaps</strong> result from unresolved overlaps in the assembly graph. In this case, two different contigs end up representing the same sequence, effectively duplicating it. Overlaps happen when a branching point in an assembly graph is resolved such that the contig before the vertex and a contig after the vertex share the same overlapping sequence.</p>

<figure id="figure-1" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/vgp_assembly/falseduplications.png" alt="Types of false duplication." width="750" height="369" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/vgp_assembly/falseduplications.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> Schematic of types of false duplication.

<p><strong>Purging</strong>: Purging aims to remove false duplications, collapsed repeats, and very low support/coverage regions from an assembly. When performed on a primary assembly, the haplotigs are removed from the primary and typically placed in the alternate assembly.</p>

<p><strong>Scaffold</strong>: A scaffold refers to one or more contigs separated by gap (unknown) sequence. Scaffolds are usually generated with the aid of additional information, such as Bionano optical maps, linked reads, Hi-C chromatin information, etc. The regions between contigs are usually of unknown sequence, thus they are represented by sequences of <em>N</em>’s. Gap length in the sequence can be sized or arbitrary, depending on the technology used for scaffolding (<em>e.g.</em>, optical maps can introduce sized gaps, while scaffolding software using <abbr title="all-versus-all chromatin conformation capture">Hi-C</abbr> information usually uses an arbitrary number of N’s, such as 500 or 200).</p>

<p>For more about the specific scaffolding technologies used in the VGP pipeline (currently Bionano optical maps and Hi-C chromatin conformation data), please refer to those specific sections within this tutorial.</p>

<p><strong>HiFi reads</strong>: PacBio <abbr title="high fidelity">HiFi</abbr> reads are the focus of this tutorial. First described in 2019, they have revolutionized genome assembly by combining long (about 10-20 kbp) read lengths with high accuracy (&gt;Q20) typically associated with short-read sequencing (<span class="citation"><a href="#Wenger2019">Wenger <i>et al.</i> 2019</a></span>). These higher read lengths enable HiFi reads to traverse some repeat regions that are problematic to assemble with short reads.</p>

<p><strong>Ultra-long reads</strong>: Ultra-long reads are typically defined as reads of over 100 kbp, and are usually generated using Oxford Nanopore Technology. Read quality is often lower than HiFi or Illumina (<em>i.e.</em>, have a higher error rate), but they are often significantly longer than any other current sequencing technology, and can help assembly algorithms walk complex repeat regions in the assembly graphs.</p>

<p><strong>Manual curation</strong>: This term refers to manually evaluating and manipulating an assembly based on the raw supporting evidence (<em>e.g.</em>, using Hi-C contact map information). The user takes into account the original sequencing data to resolve potential <em>misassemblies</em> and <em>missed joins</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Misassembly</strong>: Misassemblies are a type of assembly error that usually refers to any structural error in the genome reconstruction, <em>e.g.</em>, sequences that are not adjacent in the genome being placed next to each other in the sequence. Misassemblies can be potentially identified and remedied by manual curation.</p>

<p><strong>Missed join</strong>: A missed join happens when two sequences are adjacent to each other in the genome but are not represented contiguously in the final sequence. Missed joins can be identified and remedied in manual curation with Hi-C data.</p>

<p><strong>Telomere-to-telomere assembly</strong>: Often abbreviated as “T2T”, this term refers to an assembly where each chromosome is completely gapless from telomere to telomere. The term usually refers to the recently completed CHM13 human genome (<span class="citation"><a href="#Nurk2022">Nurk <i>et al.</i> 2022</a></span>), though there is an increasing number of efforts to generate T2T genomes for other species.</p>

<h1 id="vgp-assembly-pipeline-overview">VGP assembly pipeline overview</h1>

<p>The <abbr title="Vertebrate Genomes Project">VGP</abbr> assembly pipeline has a modular organization, consisting of ten workflows (Fig. 1). It can used with the following types of input data:</p>

<table>

<p>In this table, <em>HiFi</em> and <em>Hi-C</em> refer to HiFi and Hi-C data derived from the individual whose genome is being assembled. <strong>This tutorial assumes you are assembling the genome of one individual; there are special considerations necessary for pooled data that are not covered in this tutorial.</strong> (Note: you can use Hi-C data from another individual of the same species to scaffold, but you <em>cannot</em> use that data to phase the contigs in hifiasm.) <em>Parental data</em> is high-coverage whole genome resequencing data derived from the parents of the individual being assembled, and is the key component of trio-based genome assembly. Each combination of input datasets is demonstrated in Fig. 2 by an <em>analysis trajectory</em>: a combination of workflows designed for generating the best assembly given a particular combination of inputs. These trajectories are listed in the table above and shown in the figure below.</p>

<figure id="figure-2" style="max-width: 90%;"><div style="overflow-x: auto"><object data="../../images/vgp_assembly/VGP_workflow_modules.svg" type="image/svg+xml" alt="The nine workflows of Galaxy assembly pipeline.

A decision on whether or not to invoke Workflow 6 is based on the analysis of QC output of workflows 3, 4, or 5. Thicker lines connecting Workflows 7, 8, and 9 represent the fact that these workflows are invoked separately for each phased assembly (once for maternal and once for paternal).</figcaption></figure>

<p>The stages of genome assembly in the VGP-Galaxy pipeline are generally:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>K</em>-mer profiling</strong>: the generation of <em>k</em>-mer profiles of the raw reads to estimate genome size, heterozygosity, repetitiveness, and error rate. This is useful for getting an idea of the genome that lies within your reads, and is also useful for necessary for parameterizing downstream workflows. The generation of <em>k</em>-mer counts can be done from HiFi data only (Workflow 1), or include data from parental reads for trio-based phasing (Workflow 2), if one wants to generate <em>k</em>-mer spectra for the individual’s parents, as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Contig assembly</strong>: In addition to using only <abbr title="high fidelity">HiFi</abbr> reads (Workflow 3), the contig building (contiging) step can leverage <abbr title="all-versus-all chromatin conformation capture">Hi-C</abbr> (Workflow 4) or parental read data (Workflow 5) to produce fully-phased haplotypes (hap1/hap2 or parental/maternal assigned haplotypes), using <a href="https://github.com/chhylp123/hifiasm"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hifiasm</code></a>. The contiging workflows also produce a number of critical quality control (QC) metrics such as <em>k</em>-mer multiplicity profiles. Inspection of these profiles provides information to decide whether the third stage—purging of false duplication—is required.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(<em>Optional</em>) <strong>Purging</strong>: Purging duplicates (Workflow 6) using <a href="https://github.com/dfguan/purge_dups"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">purge_dups</code></a> identifies and resolves haplotype-specific assembly segments incorrectly labeled as primary contigs, as well as heterozygous contig overlaps. This increases contiguity and the quality of the final assembly. The purging stage is generally unnecessary for trio data, as haplotype resolution is attained using set operations done on parental <em>k</em>-mers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Scaffolding</strong>: Scaffolding produces chromosome-level scaffolds using information provided by Bionano (Workflow 7, with <a href="https://bionano.com/software-downloads/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bionano Solve</code></a> (optional)) and Hi-C (Workflow 8, with <a href="https://github.com/c-zhou/yahsscaffolding"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YaHS</code></a> algorithms).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Decontamination</strong>: A final step of decontamination (Workflow 9) removes non-target sequences (e.g., contamination as well as mitochondrial sequences) from the scaffolded assembly. A separate workflow (WF0) is used for mitochondrial assembly.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This training has been organized into four main sections: genome profile analysis, assembly of <abbr title="high fidelity">HiFi</abbr> reads with hifiasm, scaffolding with Bionano optical maps, and scaffolding with <abbr title="all-versus-all chromatin conformation capture">Hi-C</abbr> data. Additionally, the <strong>assembly with hifiasm</strong> section has two possible paths in this tutorial: solo contiging or solo w/HiC contiging.</p>

<p>Throughout this tutorial, there will be <strong>detail boxes</strong> with additional background information on the science behind the sequencing technologies and software we use in the pipeline. These boxes are minimized by default, but please expand them to learn more about the data we utilize in this pipeline.</p>

<h1 id="get-data">Get data</h1>

<p>In order to reduce computation time, we will assemble samples from the yeast <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> S288C, a widely used laboratory strain isolated in the 1950s by Robert Mortimer. Using <em>S. cerevisae</em>, one of the most intensively studied eukaryotic model organisms, has the additional advantage of allowing us to evaluate the final result of our assembly with great precision. For this tutorial, we generated a set of synthetic HiFi reads corresponding to a theoretical diploid genome.</p>

<blockquote class="details">

  <p>The synthetic HiFi reads were generated by using the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/15?genome_assembly_id=22535">S288C assembly</a> as reference genome. With this objective we used <a href="https://github.com/thegenemyers/HI.SIM">HIsim</a>, a HiFi shotgun simulator. The commands used are detailed below:</p>

</code></pre></div>  </div>
  <p>The selected mutation rate was 2%. Note that HIsim generates the synthetic reads in FASTA format. This is perfectly fine for illustrating the workflow, but you should be aware that usually you will work with HiFi reads in FASTQ format.</p>

<h1 id="hifi-reads-preprocessing-with-cutadapt">HiFi reads preprocessing with <strong>cutadapt</strong></h1>

<p>Adapter trimming usually means trimming the adapter sequence off the ends of reads, which is where the adapter sequence is usually located in <abbr title="next generation sequencing">NGS</abbr> reads. However, due to the nature of <abbr title="single-molecule real-time">SMRT</abbr> sequencing technology, adapters do not have a specific, predictable location in  <abbr title="high fidelity">HiFi</abbr> reads. Additionally, the reads containing adapter sequences could be of generally lower quality compared to the rest of the reads. Thus, we will use <strong>cutadapt</strong> not to trim, but to remove the entire read if a read is found to have an adapter inside of it.</p>

<h1 id="genome-profile-analysis">Genome profile analysis</h1>

<p>Before starting a <em>de novo</em> genome assembly project, it is useful to collect metrics on the properties of the genome under consideration, such as the expected genome size, so that you know what to expect from your assembly. Traditionally, DNA flow cytometry was considered the golden standard for estimating the genome size. Nowadays, experimental methods have been replaced by computational approaches (<span class="citation"><a href="#wang2020estimation">Wang <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>). One widely used genome profiling methods is based on the analysis of <em>k</em>-mer frequencies. It allows one to provide information not only about the genomic complexity, such as the genome size and levels of heterozygosity and repeat content, but also about the data quality.</p>

<blockquote class="details">
  <div class="box-title details-title" id="details-i-k-i-mer-size-sequencing-coverage-and-genome-size"><button class="gtn-boxify-button details" type="button" aria-controls="details-i-k-i-mer-size-sequencing-coverage-and-genome-size" aria-expanded="true"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Details: <i>K</i>-mer size, sequencing coverage and genome size</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p><em>K</em>-mers are unique substrings of length <em>k</em> contained within a DNA sequence. For example, the DNA sequence <em>TCGATCACA</em> can be decomposed into five unique <em>k</em>-mers that have five bases long: <em>TCGAT</em>, <em>CGATC</em>, <em>GATCA</em>, <em>ATCAC</em> and <em>TCACA</em>. A sequence of length L will have  L-k+1 <em>k</em>-mers. On the other hand, the number of possible <em>k</em>-mers can be calculated as  n<sup>k</sup>, where n is the number of possible monomers and k is the <em>k</em>-mer size.</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Bases</th>
        <th><em>k</em>-mer size</th>
        <th>Total possible <em>k</em>-mers</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>4</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>16</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>64</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>…</td>
        <td>…</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>1.048.576</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Thus, the <em>k</em>-mer size is a key parameter, which must be large enough to map uniquely to the genome, but not too large, since it can lead to wasting computational resources. In the case of the human genome, <em>k</em>-mers of 31 bases in length lead to 96.96% of unique <em>k</em>-mers.</p>

  <p>Each unique <em>k</em>-mer can be assigned a value for coverage based on the number of times it occurs in a sequence, whose distribution will approximate a Poisson distribution, with the peak corresponding to the average genome sequencing depth. From the genome coverage, the genome size can be easily computed.</p>

<h2 id="generation-of-k-mer-spectra-with-meryl">Generation of <em>k</em>-mer spectra with <strong>Meryl</strong></h2>

<p>Meryl will allow us to generate the <em>k</em>-mer profile by decomposing the sequencing data into <em>k</em>-length substrings, counting the occurrence of each <em>k</em>-mer and determining its frequency. The original version of Meryl was developed for the Celera Assembler. The current Meryl version comprises three main modules: one for generating <em>k</em>-mer databases, one for filtering and combining databases, and one for searching databases. <em>K</em>-mers are stored in lexicographical order in the database, similar to words in a dictionary (<span class="citation"><a href="#Rhie2020">Rhie <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>).</p>

  <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-i-k-i-mer-size-estimation"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment: <i>k</i>-mer size estimation</div>

  <p>Given an estimated genome size (<em>G</em>) and a tolerable collision rate (<em>p</em>), an appropriate <em>k</em> can be computed as \(k = \log\_4\left(\frac{G(1-p)}{p}\right)\) .</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In order to identify some key characteristics of the genome, we do genome profile analysis. To do this, we start by generating a histogram of the <em>k</em>-mer distribution in the raw reads (the <em>k</em>-mer spectrum). Then, GenomeScope creates a model fitting the spectrum that allows for estimation of genome characteristics. We work in parallel on each set of raw reads, creating a database of each file’s <em>k</em>-mer counts, and then merge the databases of counts in order to build the histogram.</p>

<figure id="figure-6" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/vgp_assembly/genomescope_plot.png" alt="Genomescope plot. " width="2000" height="2000" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/vgp_assembly/genomescope_plot.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 6</strong>:</span> GenomeScope2 31-mer profile. The first peak located at coverage 25✕ corresponds to the heterozygous peak. The second peak at coverage 50✕, corresponds to the homozygous peak. Estimate of the heterozygous portion is 0.576%. The plot also includes information about the inferred total genome length (len), genome unique length percent ('uniq'), overall heterozygosity rate ('ab'), mean *k*-mer coverage for heterozygous bases ('kcov'), read error rate ('err'), and average rate of read duplications ('dup'). It also reports the user-given parameters of *k*-mer size ('k') and ploidy ('p').</figcaption></figure>

<p>This distribution is the result of the Poisson process underlying the generation of sequencing reads. As we can see, the <em>k</em>-mer profile follows a bimodal distribution, indicative of a diploid genome. The distribution is consistent with the theoretical diploid model (model fit &gt; 93%). Low frequency <em>k</em>-mers are the result of sequencing errors. GenomeScope2 estimated a haploid genome size is around 11.7 Mb, a value reasonably close to <em>Saccharomyces</em> genome size. Additionally, it revealed that the variation across the genomic sequences is 0.576%. Some of these parameters can be used later on to parameterize running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">purge_dups</code>. This is covered in the <a href="#solo_hic_switch"><strong>solo</strong> contiging section</a> section of the tutorial.</p>

<h1 id="assembly-with-hifiasm">Assembly with <strong>hifiasm</strong></h1>

<p>Once we have finished the genome profiling stage, we can start the genome assembly with hifiasm,  a fast open-source <em>de novo</em> assembler specifically developed for PacBio HiFi reads. One of the key advantages of hifiasm is that it allows us to resolve near-identical, but not exactly identical, sequences, such as repeats and segmental duplications (<span class="citation"><a href="#Cheng2021">Cheng <i>et al.</i> 2021</a></span>).</p>

<blockquote class="details">
  <div class="box-title details-title" id="details-hifiasm-algorithm-details"><button class="gtn-boxify-button details" type="button" aria-controls="details-hifiasm-algorithm-details" aria-expanded="true"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Details: Hifiasm algorithm details</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p>By default hifiasm performs three rounds of haplotype-aware error correction to correct sequence errors but keeping heterozygous alleles. A position on the target read to be corrected is considered informative if there are two different nucleotides at that position in the alignment, and each allele is supported by at least three reads.</p>

  <figure id="figure-7" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/vgp_assembly/hifiasm_algorithm.png" alt="Hifiasm algorithm overview. " width="999" height="753" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/vgp_assembly/hifiasm_algorithm.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 7</strong>:</span> Hifiasm algorithm overview. Orange and blue bars represent the reads with heterozygous alleles carrying local phasing information, while green bars come from the homozygous regions without any heterozygous alleles.</figcaption></figure>

  <p>Then, hifiasm builds a phased assembly string graph with local phasing information from the corrected reads. Only the reads coming from the same haplotype are connected in the phased assembly graph. After transitive reduction, a pair of heterozygous alleles is represented by a <em>bubble</em> in the string graph. If there is no additional data, hifiasm arbitrarily selects one side of each bubble and outputs a primary assembly. In the case of a heterozygous genome, the primary assembly generated at this step may still retain haplotigs from the alternate allele.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The output of hifiasm will be <a href="https://github.com/GFA-spec/GFA-spec">GFA</a> files. These differ from FASTA files in that they are a representation of the assembly graph instead of just linear sequences, so the Graphical Fragment Assembly (GFA) contains information about sequences, nodes, and edges (<em>i.e.</em>, overlaps). This output preserves the most information about how the reads assemble in graph space, and is useful to visualize in tools such as Bandage; however, our QV tools will expect FASTA files, so we will cover the GFA to FASTA conversion step later.</p>

<h2 id="hifiasm-assembly-modes"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hifiasm</code> assembly modes</h2>

<p>Hifiasm can be run in multiple modes depending on data availability</p>

The purged primary contigs are then carried through scaffolding with Bionano and/or Hi-C data, resulting in one final draft primary assembly to be sent to manual curation.</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="hi-c-phased-mode"><strong>Hi-C</strong> phased mode</h3>

<p><strong>Hi-C-phased</strong>: generates a hap1 assembly and a hap2 assembly, which are phased using the <abbr title="all-versus-all chromatin conformation capture">Hi-C</abbr> reads from the same individual.</p>

<p>No matter which way you run hifiasm, you will have to evaluate the assemblies’ <abbr title="Quality Control">QC</abbr> to ensure your genome is in good shape. The VGP pipeline features several reference-free ways of evaluating assembly quality, all of which are automatically generated with our workflows; however, we will run them manually in this tutorial so we can familiarize ourselves with how each QC metric captures a different aspect of assembly quality. If you are interested in running the workflows with automatic QC generation, please see our <a href="/training-material/topics/assembly/tutorials/vgp_workflow_training/tutorial.html">corresponding workflow tutorial</a> .</p>

<h2 id="assembly-evaluation">Assembly evaluation</h2>

<p>We use several tools for assessing various aspects of assembly quality:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>gfastats</strong>: manipulation &amp; evaluation of assembly graphs and FASTA files, particularly used for summary statistics (<em>e.g.</em>, contig count, N50, NG50, etc.) (<span class="citation"><a href="#Formenti2022">Formenti <i>et al.</i> 2022</a></span>).</li>
</ul>
<figure id="figure-11" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/vgp_assembly/n50schematic.jpg" alt="Schematic of N50 calculation." width="699" height="141" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/vgp_assembly/n50schematic.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 11</strong>:</span> <b>N50</b> is a commonly reported statistic used to represent genome contiguity. N50 is calculated by sorting contigs according to their lengths, and then taking the halfway point of the total genome length. The size of the contig at that halfway point is the N50 value. In the pictured example, the total genome length is 400 bp, so the N50 value is 60 because the contig at the halfway point is 60 bp long. N50 can be interpreted as the value where &gt;50% of an assembly's contigs are at that value or higher. Image adapted from <a href="https://www.molecularecologist.com/2017/03/29/whats-n50/">Elin Videvall at The Molecular Ecologist</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO)</strong>: assesses completeness of a genome from an evolutionarily informed functional point of view. BUSCO genes are genes that are expected to be present at single-copy in one haplotype for a certain clade, so their presence, absence, or duplication can inform scientists about if an assembly is likely missing important regions, or if it has multiple copies of them, which can indicate a need for purging (<span class="citation"><a href="#Simo2015">Simão <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>).</li>
  <li><strong>Merqury</strong>: reference-free assessment of assembly completeness and phasing based on <em>k</em>-mers. Merqury compares <em>k</em>-mers in the reads to the <em>k</em>-mers found in the assemblies, as well as the copy number (CN) of each <em>k</em>-mer in the assemblies (<span class="citation"><a href="#Rhie_merqury">Rhie <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>).</li>

  <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-how-do-i-pick-which-assembly-trajectory-to-use"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment: How do I pick which assembly trajectory to use?</div>
  <p>The ideal scenario would be a trio assembly, where you can use parental data as a ground truth for phasing the haplotypes in the child. Unfortunately, attaining parental samples is difficult and often impossible when studying wild-caught organisms. When parental data is absent, the VGP recommends assembling using <abbr title="all-versus-all chromatin conformation capture">Hi-C</abbr> phasing, if possible. This requires the Hi-C data to be derived from the same individual as the HiFi data. If this is not possible, then you cannot use the Hi-C data to phase the contigs, but you can still use it for scaffolding the primary assembly. Refer to the following decision tree for a visual representation of this logic.</p>

  <figure id="figure-12" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/vgp_assembly/WF3vsWF4_decisiontree.png" alt="Decision tree for picking workflow trajectory when one does not have parental data." width="3136" height="1412" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/vgp_assembly/WF3vsWF4_decisiontree.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 12</strong>:</span> If the HiFi and Hi-C data *do not* come from the same individual, then you can use WF3. After that, if you need to purge the primary, then run WF6 and then scaffolding. If the primary does not need purging, you can continue straight to scaffolding the primary. If the HiFi and Hi-C data *do* come from the same individual, then you can use WF4 to obtain hap1 and hap2 assemblies. If either of the assemblies need to be purged, then you can use WF6B to purge an individual haplotype. Then you can scaffold the assemblies separately. Accordingly, if neither need to be purged, then you can proceed to just scaffolding them separately.</figcaption></figure>

  <p>Next, we will use <abbr title="Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs">BUSCO</abbr>, which will provide a qualitative assessment of the completeness of a genome assembly in terms of expected gene content.

  <p>Despite BUSCO being robust for species that have been widely studied, it can be inaccurate when the newly assembled genome belongs to a taxonomic group that is not well represented in <a href="https://www.orthodb.org/">OrthoDB</a>. Merqury provides a complementary approach for assessing genome assembly quality metrics in a reference-free manner via <em>k</em>-mer copy number analysis.

  <p>By default, Merqury generates three collections as output: stats, plots and consensus accuracy quality value (QV) stats. The “stats” collection contains the completeness statistics, while the “QV stats” collection contains the quality value statistics. Let’s have a look at the assembly <abbr title="copy number">CN</abbr> spectrum plot, known as the <em>spectra-cn.ln</em> plot:</p>

  <figure id="figure-14" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/vgp_assembly/merqury_cn_plot.png" alt="Merqury spectra-cn plot for the hap1/hap2 assemblies." width="1800" height="1500" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/vgp_assembly/merqury_cn_plot.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 14</strong>:</span> Merqury CN plot. This plot tracks the multiplicity of each <i>k</i>-mer found in the HiFi read set and colors it by the number of times it is found in a given assembly. Merqury connects the midpoint of each histogram bin with a line, giving the illusion of a smooth curve.</figcaption></figure>

  <p>The grey region in the left side corresponds to <em>k</em>-mers found only in the read set; it is usually indicative of sequencing error in the read set, although it can also be a result of missing sequences in the assembly. The red area represents one-copy <em>k</em>-mers in the genome, while the blue area represents two-copy <em>k</em>-mers originating from homozygous sequences or haplotype-specific duplications. From this figure, we can state that the diploid sequencing coverage is around 50✕, which we also know from the GenomeScope2 plot we looked at <a href="#figure-5">earlier</a>.</p>

  <p>To get an idea of how the <em>k</em>-mers have been distributed between our hap1 and hap2 assemblies, we should look at the <em>spectra-asm.fl</em> output of Merqury.</p>

  <figure id="figure-15" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/vgp_assembly/merqury_hap1hap2_asm.png" alt="Merqury spectra-asm plot for the hap1/hap2 assemblies." width="1268" height="988" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/vgp_assembly/merqury_hap1hap2_asm.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 15</strong>:</span> Merqury ASM plot. This plot tracks the multiplicity of each <i>k</i>-mer found in the HiFi read set and colors it according to which assemblies contain those <i>k</i>-mers. This can tell you which <i>k</i>-mers are found in only one assembly or shared between them.</figcaption></figure>

  <p>The large green peak is centered at 50✕ coverage (remember that’s our diploid coverage!), indicating that <em>k</em>-mers suggested by the reads to be from diploid regions are in fact shared between the two assemblies, as they should be if they are from homozygous regions. The haploid coverage <em>k</em>-mers (around ~25✕ coverage) are split between hap1 and hap2 assemblies, somewhat unevenly but still not as bad as it would be in an assembly without phasing data.</p>

  <h2 id="pseudohaplotype-assembly-with-hifiasm">Pseudohaplotype assembly with <strong>hifiasm</strong></h2>

  <p>When hifiasm is run without any additional phasing data, it will do its best to generate a pseudohaplotype primary/alternate set of assemblies. These assemblies will typically contain more contigs that switch between parental blocks. Because of this, the primary assembly generated with this method can have a higher \(N50\) value than an assembly generated with haplotype-phasing, but the contigs will contain more switch errors.</p>

  <p>Take a look at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gfastats on Pri and Alt contigs</code> output — it has three columns:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Name of statistic</li>
    <li>Value for haplotype 1 (Pri)</li>
    <li>Value for haplotype 2 (Alt)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The report makes it clear that the two assemblies are markedly uneven: the primary assembly has 25 contigs totalling ~18.5 Mbp, while the alternate assembly has 8 contigs totalling only about 4.95 Mbp. If you’ll remember that our estimated genome size is ~11.7 Mbp, then you’ll see that the primary assembly has almost 2/3 more sequence than expected for a haploid representation of the genome! This is because a lot of heterozygous regions have had <em>both</em> copies of those loci placed into the primary assembly, as a result of incomplete purging. The presence of false duplications can be confirmed by looking at <abbr title="Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs">BUSCO</abbr> and Merqury results.</p>

  <p>By default, Merqury generates three collections as output: stats, plots and <abbr title="consensus accuracy quality value">QV</abbr> stats. The “stats” collection contains the completeness statistics, while the “QV stats” collection contains the quality value statistics. Let’s have a look at the assembly <abbr title="copy number">CN</abbr> spectrum plot, known as the <em>spectra-cn</em> plot:</p>

  <figure id="figure-17" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/vgp_assembly/merqury_cn_plot.png" alt="Merqury spectra-cn plot for the pri/alt assemblies." width="1800" height="1500" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/vgp_assembly/merqury_cn_plot.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 17</strong>:</span> Merqury CN plot. This plot tracks the multiplicity of each <i>k</i>-mer found in the Hi-Fi read set and colors it by the number of times it is found in a given assembly. Merqury connects the midpoint of each histogram bin with a line, giving the illusion of a smooth curve.</figcaption></figure>

  <p>The black region in the left side corresponds to <em>k</em>-mers found only in the read set; it is usually indicative of sequencing error in the read set, although it can also be indicative of missing sequences in the assembly. The red area represents one-copy <em>k</em>-mers in the genome, while the blue area represents two-copy <em>k</em>-mers originating from homozygous sequences or haplotype-specific duplications. From this figure, we can state that the diploid sequencing coverage is around 50✕, which we also know from the GenomeScope2 plot we looked at earlier.</p>

  <p>To get an idea of how the <em>k</em>-mers have been distributed between our Primary and Alternate assemblies, we should look at the <em>spectra-asm</em> output of Merqury.</p>

  <figure id="figure-18" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/vgp_assembly/merqury_prialt_asm_prepurge.png" alt="Merqury spectra-asm plot for the hap1/hap2 assemblies." width="1800" height="1500" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/vgp_assembly/merqury_prialt_asm_prepurge.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 18</strong>:</span> Merqury ASM plot. This plot tracks the multiplicity of each <i>k</i>-mer found in the HiFi read set and colors it according to which assemblies contain those <i>k</i>-mers. This can tell you which <i>k</i>-mers are found in only one assembly or shared between them.</figcaption></figure>

  <p>For an idea of what a properly phased spectra-asm plot would look like, <strong>please <a href="#solo_hic_switch">go over</a> to the Hi-C phasing version of this tutorial</strong>. A properly phased spectra-asm plot for a diploid individual should have a large green peak centered around the point of diploid coverage (here ~50✕), and the two assembly-specific peaks should be centered around the point of haploid coverage (here ~25✕) and resembling each other in size.</p>

  <p>The spectra-asm plot we have for our primary &amp; alternate assemblies here does not resemble one that is properly phased. There is a peak of green (shared) <em>k</em>-mers around diploid coverage, indicating that some homozygous regions have been properly split between the primary and alternate assemblies; however, there is still a large red peak of primary-assembly-only <em>k</em>-mers at that coverage value, too, which means that some homozygous regions are being represented twice in the primary assembly, instead of once in the primary and once in the alternate. Additionally, for the haploid peaks, the primary-only peak (in red) is much larger than the alternate-only peak (in blue), indicating that a lot of heterozygous regions might have both their alternate alleles represented in the primary assembly, which is false duplication.</p>

  <p>For further confirmation, we can also look at the individual, assembly-specific <abbr title="copy number">CN</abbr> plots. In the Merqury outputs, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">output_merqury.assembly_01.spectra-cn.fl</code> is a <abbr title="copy number">CN</abbr> spectra with <em>k</em>-mers colored according to their copy number in the primary assembly:</p>

  <figure id="figure-19" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/vgp_assembly/merqury_prialt_priCN_prepurge.png" alt="Merqury spectra-cn plot for the pri assembly only." width="1800" height="1500" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/vgp_assembly/merqury_prialt_priCN_prepurge.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 19</strong>:</span> Merqury CN plot <i>for the primary assembly only</i>. This plot colors <i>k</i>-mers according to their copy number in the primary assembly. <i>k</i>-mers that are present in the reads but not the primary assembly are labelled 'read-only'.</figcaption></figure>

  <p>In the primary-only <abbr title="copy number">CN</abbr> plot, we observe a large 2-copy (colored blue) peak at diploid coverage. Ideally, this would not be here, because these diploid regions would be <em>1-copy in both assemblies</em>. Purging this assembly should reconcile this by removing one copy of false duplicates, making these 2-copy <em>k</em>-mers 1-copy. You might notice the ‘read-only’ peak at haploid coverage — this is actually expected, because ‘read-only’ here just means that the <em>k</em>-mer in question is not seen in this specific assembly while it was in the original readset. <strong>Often, these ‘read-only’ <em>k</em>-mers are actually present as alternate loci in the other assembly.</strong></p>

  <p>Now that we have looked at our primary assembly with multiple <abbr title="Quality Control">QC</abbr> metrics, we know that it should undergo purging. The VGP pipeline uses <strong>purge_dups</strong> to remove false duplications from the primary assembly and put them in the alternate assembly to reconcile the haplotypes. Additionally, purge_dups can also find collapsed repeats and regions of suspiciously low coverage.</p>

  <h2 id="purging-the-primary-and-alternate-assemblies">Purging the primary and alternate assemblies</h2>

  <p>Before proceeding to purging, we need to carry out some text manipulation operations on the output generated by GenomeScope2 to make it compatible with downstream tools. The goal is to extract some parameters which at a later stage will be used by <strong>purge_dups</strong>.</p>

  <p>Now let’s parse the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transition between haploid &amp; diploid</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">upper bound for the read depth estimation</code> parameters. The transition between haploid &amp; diploid represents the coverage value halfway between haploid and diploid coverage, and helps purge_dups identify <em>haplotigs</em>. The upper bound parameter will be used by purge_dups as high read depth cutoff to identify <em>collapsed repeats</em>. When repeats are collapsed in an assembly, they are not as long as they actually are in the genome. This results in a pileup of reads at the collapsed region when mapping the reads back to the assembly.</p>

  <h2 id="purging-with-purgedups">Purging with <strong>purge_dups</strong></h2>

  <p>An ideal haploid representation would consist of one allelic copy of all heterozygous regions in the two haplomes, as well as all hemizygous regions from both haplomes (<span class="citation"><a href="#Guan2019">Guan <i>et al.</i> 2019</a></span>). However, in highly heterozygous genomes, assembly algorithms are frequently not able to identify the highly divergent allelic sequences as belonging to the same region, resulting in the assembly of those regions as separate contigs. This can lead to issues in downstream analysis, such as scaffolding, gene annotation and read mapping in general (<span class="citation"><a href="#Small2007">Small <i>et al.</i> 2007</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#Guan2019">Guan <i>et al.</i> 2019</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#Roach2018">Roach <i>et al.</i> 2018</a></span>). In order to solve this problem, we are going to use purge_dups, which will allow us to identify and reassign allelic contigs.</p>

  <p>This stage consists of three substages: read-depth analysis, generation of all versus all self-alignment and resolution of haplotigs and overlaps (fig. 8). This is meant to try to resolve the false duplications depicted in <strong>Figure 1</strong>.</p>

  <p>Purging may be used in the VGP pipeline when there are suspicions of false duplications (Figure 1). In such cases, we start by purging the <strong>primary assembly</strong>, resulting in a clean (purged) primary assembly and a set of contigs that were <em>removed</em> from those contigs. These removed contigs will often contain haplotigs representing alternate alleles. We would like to keep that in the alternate assembly, so the next step is adding (concatenating) this file to the original alternate assembly. To make sure we don’t introduce redundancies in the alternate assembly that way, we then purge that alternate assembly, which will also remove any junk or overlaps.</p>

  <p>Now, we will map the reads against the primary assembly by using Minimap2 (<span class="citation"><a href="#Li2018">Li 2018</a></span>), an alignment program designed to map long sequences.</p>

  <p>Finally, we will use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Reads mapped to contigs</code> pairwise mapping format (PAF) file for calculating some statistics required in a later stage. In this step, purge_dups (listed as <strong>Purge overlaps</strong> in Galaxy tool panel) initially produces a read-depth histogram from base-level coverages. This information is used for estimating the coverage cutoffs, taking into account that collapsed haplotype contigs will lead to reads from both alleles mapping to those contigs, whereas if the alleles have assembled as separate contigs, then the reads will be split over the two contigs, resulting in half the read-depth (<span class="citation"><a href="#Roach2018">Roach <i>et al.</i> 2018</a></span>).</p>

  <h3 id="resolution-of-haplotigs-and-overlaps">Resolution of haplotigs and overlaps</h3>

  <p>During the final step of the purge_dups pipeline, it will use the self alignments and the cutoffs for identifying the haplotypic duplications.</p>

  <blockquote class="details">
    <div class="box-title details-title" id="details-purge-overlaps-purge-dups-algorithm-details"><button class="gtn-boxify-button details" type="button" aria-controls="details-purge-overlaps-purge-dups-algorithm-details" aria-expanded="true"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Details: Purge overlaps (purge_dups) algorithm details</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

    <p>In order to identify the haplotypic duplications, purge_dups uses the  base-level coverage information to flag the contigs according to the following criteria:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If more than 80% bases of a contig are above the high read depth cutoff or below the noise cutoff, it is discarded.</li>
      <li>If more than 80% bases are in the diploid depth interval, it is labeled as a primary contig, otherwise it is considered further as a possible haplotig.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Contigs that were flagged for further analysis according to read-depth are then evaluated to attempt to identify synteny with its allelic companion contig. In this step, purge_dups uses the information contained in the self alignments:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If the alignment score is larger than the cutoff <em>s</em> (default 70), the contig is marked for reassignment as haplotig. Contigs marked for reassignment with a maximum match score greater than the cutoff <em>m</em> (default 200) are further flagged as repetitive regions.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Otherwise contigs are considered as a candidate primary contig.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Once all matches associated with haplotigs have been removed from the self-alignment set, purge_dups ties consistent matches between the remaining candidates to find collinear matches, filtering all the matches whose score is less than the minimum chaining score <em>l</em>.</p>

    <p>Finally, purge_dups calculates the average coverage of the matching intervals for each overlap, and mark an unambiguous overlap as heterozygous when the average coverage on both contigs is less than the read-depth cutoff, removing the sequences corresponding to the matching interval in the shorter contig.</p>

  <h3 id="post-purge-quality-control">Post-purge quality control</h3>

  <p>Recall that, prior to purging, our primary assembly showed it needed to be purged due to several quality metrics: there was a large amount of BUSCO duplicated genes, many 2-copy <em>k</em>-mers that were primary-only instead of shared, and the primary was ~2/3 times larger than the expected genome size. Let’s check if these metrics changed after purging.</p>

  <p>The summary statistics indicate that both assemblies are now of a similar size that is much closer to the expected genome size: the purged primary assembly is 17 contigs totalling ~12.1 Mbp, while the purged alternate assembly is 16 contigs that amount to ~11.3 Mbp. This makes sense since, during purging, we removed sequences from the primary assembly and added them to the alternate assembly. But did we remove the <em>right</em> sequences? Remember, the sequences we are aiming to re-distribute are the false duplications that were flagged by BUSCO.</p>

  <figure id="figure-23" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/vgp_assembly/busco_pri_purged.png" alt="BUSCO for primary assembly after purging." width="2450" height="1024" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/vgp_assembly/busco_pri_purged.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 23</strong>:</span> BUSCO for the primary assembly after purging.</figcaption></figure>

  <p>The <abbr title="Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs">BUSCO</abbr> results for the purged primary assembly look much better, since we no longer have the large amount of duplicate BUSCOs that we previously had. Additionally, there is no large increase in missing BUSCOs, indicating that we have <em>not</em> over-purged the primary assembly.</p>

  <p>The previous metrics tell us that the primary is likely fixed after purging, but what about the previously incomplete alternate assembly? Let’s see if the Merqury spectra plots show any change in how <em>k</em>-mers are split up between the two assemblies:</p>

  <figure id="figure-24" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/vgp_assembly/merqury_prialt_asm_postpurge.png" alt="Merqury spectra-asm plot after purging." width="1234" height="982" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/vgp_assembly/merqury_prialt_asm_postpurge.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 24</strong>:</span> Merqury ASM plot after purging.</figcaption></figure>

  <p>This looks a lot better! The diploid regions are all shared between the two assemblies (the large green peak centered at 50x, the diploid coverage value), and the haplotypic variation is shared between the primary and alternate assemblies (the red and blue peaks centered around 25✕, the haploid coverage value).</p>

  <figure id="figure-25" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/vgp_assembly/merqury_prialt_priCN_postpurge.png" alt="Merqury spectra-cn plot for primary assembly after purging." width="1234" height="982" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/vgp_assembly/merqury_prialt_priCN_postpurge.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 25</strong>:</span> Merqury CN plot <i>for the primary assembly only</i> after purging.</figcaption></figure>

  <p>Additionally, when we look at the primary-only <abbr title="copy number">CN</abbr> plot, we see that the large peak of 2-copy <em>k</em>-mers is now gone, since those regions are now represented at 1-copy only in the primary assembly, as they should be.</p>

<h1 id="scaffolding">Scaffolding</h1>

<p>At this point, we have a set of contigs, which may or may not be fully phased, depending on how we ran hifiasm. Next, the contigs will be assembled into scaffolds, <em>i.e.</em>, sequences of contigs interspaced with gaps. The VGP pipeline currently scaffolds using two additional technologies: Bionano optical maps and <abbr title="all-versus-all chromatin conformation capture">Hi-C</abbr> data.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of this tutorial, the scaffolding hands-on exercises will be <b>referring to a Hap1 assembly</b> produced with the Hi-C mode of hifiasm. You can try the tutorial on hap2, if you want. And if you have a pseudohaplotype assembly, then you can also follow along with your purged (if necessary) primary contigs. (NB: The alternate assembly <em>is not</em> scaffolded, as it is an incomplete assembly.) <b>Either way, wherever the tutorial refers to hap1 contigs, just replace that with whichever haplotype you are scaffolding.</b></p>

Optical maps, such as those produced using the Bionano Saphyr, as well as Hi-C data such as those generated by Arima Hi-C or Dovetail OmniC kits, are used to re-order and orient contigs according to long-range information. This generates the draft scaffold-level genome. This draft genome then undergoes manual curation, which uses information such as coverage tracks or repeat annotations in order to further orient scaffolds and correct misassemblies such as mis-joins and missed joins.

<p>In this step, the linkage information provided by optical maps is integrated with primary assembly sequences, and the overlaps are used to orient and order the contigs, resolve chimeric joins, and estimate the length of gaps between adjacent contigs. One of the advantages of optical maps is that they can easily span genomic regions that are difficult to resolve using DNA sequencing technologies (<span class="citation"><a href="#Savara2021">Savara <i>et al.</i> 2021</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#Yuan2020">Yuan <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>).</p>

  <p>Bionano technology relies on the isolation of kilobase-long DNA fragments, which are labeled at specific sequence motifs with a fluorescent dye, resulting in a unique fluorescent pattern for each genome. DNA molecules are stretched into nanoscale channels and imaged with a high-resolution camera, allowing us to build optical maps that include the physical locations of labels rather than base-level information (<span class="citation"><a href="#Lam2012">Lam <i>et al.</i> 2012</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#Giani2020">Giani <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#Savara2021">Savara <i>et al.</i> 2021</a></span>).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Generate <em>in silico</em> maps for sequence assembly.</li>
  <li>Align <em>in silico</em> sequence maps against Bionano genome maps to identify and resolve potential conflicts.</li>
  <li>Merge the non-conflicting maps into hybrid scaffolds.</li>
  <li>Align sequence maps to the hybrid scaffolds</li>
  <li>Generate AGP and FASTA files for the scaffolds.</li>

<h1 id="hi-c-scaffolding">Hi-C scaffolding</h1>

<p>Hi-C is a sequencing-based molecular assay designed to identify regions of frequent physical interaction in the genome by measuring the contact frequency between all pairs of loci, allowing us to provide an insight into the three-dimensional organization of a genome  (<span class="citation"><a href="#Dixon2012">Dixon <i>et al.</i> 2012</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#LiebermanAiden2009">Lieberman-Aiden <i>et al.</i> 2009</a></span>). In this final stage, we will exploit the fact that the contact frequency between a pair of loci strongly correlates with the one-dimensional distance between them with the objective of linking the Bionano scaffolds to a chromosome scale.</p>

<blockquote class="details">

  <p>The high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technology is based on the capture of the chromatin in three-dimensional space. During Hi-C library preparation, DNA is crosslinked in its 3D conformation. Then, the DNA is digested using restriction enzymes, and the digested ends are filled with biotinylated nucleotides. The biotinylated nucleotides enable the specific purification of the ligation junctions, preventing the sequencing of DNA molecules that do not contain such junctions which are thus mostly uninformative (<span class="citation"><a href="#Lajoie2015">Lajoie <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>).</p>

  <p>Next, the blunt ends of the spatially proximal digested end are ligated. Each DNA fragment is then sequenced from each end of this artificial junction, generating read pairs. This provides contact information that can be used to reconstruct the proximity of genomic sequences belonging to the same chromosome (<span class="citation"><a href="#Giani2020">Giani <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>). Hi-C data are in the form of two-dimensional matrices (contact maps) whose entries quantify the intensity of the physical interaction between genome regions.</p>

<h2 id="pre-processing-hi-c-data">Pre-processing Hi-C data</h2>

<p>Despite Hi-C generating paired-end reads, we need to map each read separately. This is because most aligners assume that the distance between paired-end reads fit a known distribution, but in Hi-C data the insert size of the ligation product can vary between one base pair to hundreds of megabases (<span class="citation"><a href="#Lajoie2015">Lajoie <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>).</p>

  <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-biological-basis-of-hi-c-contact-maps"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment: Biological basis of Hi-C contact maps</div>

  <p>Hi-C contact maps reflect the interaction frequency between genomic loci. In order to understand the Hi-C contact maps, it is necessary to take into account two factors: the higher interaction frequency between loci that reside in the same chromosome (<em>i.e.</em>, in <em>cis</em>), and the distance-dependent decay of interaction frequency (<span class="citation"><a href="#Lajoie2015">Lajoie <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>).</p>

  <p>The higher interaction between <em>cis</em> regions can be explained, at least in part, by the territorial organization of chromosomes in interphase (chromosome territories), and in a genome-wide contact map, this pattern appears as blocks of high interaction centered along the diagonal and matching individual chromosomes (<span class="citation"><a href="#Cremer2010">Cremer and Cremer 2010</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#Lajoie2015">Lajoie <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>):</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the distance-dependent decay may be due to random movement of the chromosomes, and in the contact map appears as a gradual decrease of the interaction frequency the farther away from the diagonal it moves (<span class="citation"><a href="#Lajoie2015">Lajoie <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>).</p>

<p>Let’s have a look at the Hi-C contact maps generated by Pretext Snapshot.</p>

<figure id="figure-31" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/vgp_assembly/hic_map_pretext.png" alt="Pretext optical map.

Primary assembly full contact map generated in this training (a) Hi-C map representative of a typical missasembly (b).</figcaption></figure>

<p>In the contact generated from the Bionano-scaffolded assembly can be identified 17 scaffolds, representing each of the haploid chromosomes of our genome (panel <strong>a</strong> above). The fact that all the contact signals are found around the diagonal suggest that the contigs were scaffolded in the right order. However, during the assembly of complex genomes, it is common to find in the contact maps indicators of errors during the scaffolding process, as shown in panel <strong>b</strong>. In that case, a contig belonging to the second chromosome has been misplaced as part of the fourth chromosome. We can also note that the final portion of the second chromosome should be placed at the beginning, as the off-diagonal contact signal suggests.</p>

<p>Once we have evaluated the quality of the scaffolded genome assembly, the next step consists in integrating the information contained in the HiC reads into our assembly, so that any errors identified can be resolved. For this purpose we will use YaHS (<span class="citation"><a href="#Zhou2022">Zhou <i>et al.</i> 2022</a></span>).</p>

<h2 id="yahs-scaffolding"><strong>YaHS</strong> scaffolding</h2>

<p>YaHS is an open source software that makes use of Hi-C to linearly orient and order assembled contigs along entire chromosomes (<span class="citation"><a href="#Zhou2022">Zhou <i>et al.</i> 2022</a></span>). One of the advantages of Yahs with respect to most existing Hi-C scaffolding tools is that it doesn’t require the estimated number of chromosomes.</p>

<blockquote class="comment">
  <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-yahs-algorithm-overview"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment: YAHS algorithm overview</div>

  <p>YaHS takes the alignment between Hi-C reads and contigs, breaking contigs at positions lacking Hi-C coverage to address potential assembly errors.</p>

  <p>Scaffolding occurs in multiple rounds, with YaHS creating a contact matrix for each contig by splitting it into chunks. Hi-C contact signals are assigned to cells within contigs (intra-cells) and between contigs (inter-cells; see figure below). Joining scores for contig pairs are calculated based on normalized contact frequencies, aiming for similar inter-cell frequencies between neighboring contigs.</p>

  <p>Optionally considering Hi-C library restriction enzymes, YaHS normalizes contact frequencies by the corresponding number of cutting sites. A scaffolding graph is constructed with contigs as nodes and contig joins as weighted edges. The graph undergoes simplification steps, including edge filtering, tip and blunt end trimming, repeat resolution, transitive edge removal, bubble and ambiguous orientation resolution, weak edge trimming, and ambiguous edge removal.</p>

  <p>Finally, the graph is traversed to assemble scaffolds along continuous paths. Optionally, a second step of assembly error correction breaks scaffolds at positions lacking sufficient Hi-C coverage. YaHS employs a hierarchical joining process with multiple rounds of scaffolding at decreasing resolutions (increasing chunk sizes), using previous round scaffolds as input.</p>

<p>In order to evaluate the Hi-C hybrid scaffolding, we are going to compare the contact maps before and after running YaHS:</p>

The red circles indicate the  differences between the contact map generated after (a) and before (b) Hi-C hybrid scaffolding.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Among the most notable differences that can be identified between the contact maps, it can be highlighted the regions marked with red circles, where inversion can be identified.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>To sum up, it is worthwhile to compare the final assembly with the <a href="https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/146/045/GCF_000146045.2_R64/GCF_000146045.2_R64_assembly_stats.txt">S. cerevisiae_ S288C reference genome</a>.</p>

<figure id="figure-34" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/vgp_assembly/stats_conclusion.png" alt="Table 1: Final stats. " width="1197" height="409" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/vgp_assembly/stats_conclusion.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 34</strong>:</span> Comparison between the final assembly generated in this training and the reference genome. Contiguity plot using the reference genome size (a). Assembly statistics (b).</figcaption></figure>

<p>With respect to the total sequence length, we can conclude that the size of our genome assembly is almost identical to the reference genome (figure above). Regarding the number of scaffolds, the obtained value is similar to the reference assembly, which consists of 16 chromosomes plus the mitochondrial DNA, which consists of 85,779 bp. The remaining statistics exhibit very similar values (panel <strong>b</strong> above).</p>

<figure id="figure-35" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/vgp_assembly/hi-c_pretext_conclusion.png" alt="Comparison reference genome.

<p>If we compare the contact map of our assembled genome (panel <strong>a</strong> above) with the reference assembly (panel <strong>b</strong> above), we can see that the two are essentially identical. This means that we have achieved an almost perfect assembly at the chromosome level.</p>
