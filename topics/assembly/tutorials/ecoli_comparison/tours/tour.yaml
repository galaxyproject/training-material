name: Making sense of a newly assembled genome
description: >-
  In this tutorial, we will compare an assembly of <i>E. coli</i> C to
  assemblies of all other complete genes of this species.
title_default: ecoli_comparison
steps:
  - title: Introduction
    content: >-
      <i>E. coli</i> is one of the most studied organisms. There are
      hundreds of complete genomes (in fact, the total number of <i>E.
      coli</i> assemblies in Genbank is over 10,500). Here we will shows how
      to uploaded all (!) complete <i>E. coli</i> genomes at once.
    backdrop: true
  - title: Getting complete <i>E. coli</i> genomes into Galaxy
    content: >-
      Our initial objective is to compare our assembly against all complete
      <i>E. coli</i> genomes to identify the most related ones and to find any
      interesting genome alterations. In order to do this we need to align our
      assembly against all other genomes. And in order to do that we need to
      first obtain all these other genomes.<br><br> <a
      href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">NCBI</a> is the resource that would
      store all complete <i>E. coli</i> genomes. Specifically, they can be found
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/genomes/167">here</a>. As we
      will see, this list contains over 500 genomes and so uploading them by
      hand will likely result in carpal tunnel syndrome, which we want to
      prevent. Galaxy has several features that are specifically designed for
      uploading and managing large sets of similar types of data. The following
      two <b>Hands-on</b> sections show how they can be used to import all
      completed <i>E. coli</i> genomes into Galaxy.
    backdrop: true
  - title: Preparing a list of all complete <i>E. coli</i> genomes
    content: >-
      Open the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/genomes/167">NCBI
      list of of <i>E. coli</i> genomes</a> in a new window and position two
      browser windows (one the tutorial and the one you just opened) side by
      side. Then follow the steps in the following <a
      href="https://vimeo.com/271328293">video</a>.
    backdrop: true
  - title: Preparing a list of all complete <i>E. coli</i> genomes
    content: >-
      Now that the list is formatted as a table in a spreadsheet, it is time to
      upload it into Galaxy. There is a problem though: the URLs (web addresses)
      in the list do not actually point to sequence files that we would need to
      perform alignments. Instead they point to directories. For example, this
      URL: <br><br>
      ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/008/865/GCA_000008865.1_ASM886v1
      <br><br> points to a directory (rather than a file) containing many files,
      most of which we do not need.
    backdrop: true
  - title: History options

      We will start the analyses by creating a new history. Click on this button
      and then "Create New"
    placement: left
  - title: Preparing a list of all complete <i>E. coli</i> genomes
    content: >-
      So to download sequence files we need to edit URLs by adding filenames to
      them. For example, in the case of the URL shown above we need to add
      <b>/GCA_000008865.1_ASM886v1</b> and <b>_genomic.fna.gz</b> to the end to
      get this: <br><br>
      ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/008/865/GCA_000008865.1_ASM886v1/GCA_000008865.1_ASM886v1_genomic.fna.gz
      <br><br> This can be done as a two step process where we first copy the
      end part of the existing URL (<b>/GCA_000008865.1_ASM886v1</b>) and then
      add a fixed string <b>_genomic.fna.gz</b> to the end of it. Doing this by
      hand is crazy and trying to do it in a spreadsheet is complicated.
      Fortunately, Galaxy’s new rule-based uploader can help, as shown in the
      next <b>Hands-on</b> section.

      The assembly we just uploaded has two issues that need to be addressed
      before proceeding with our analysis<ul> <li>It contains two sequences -
      the one of <i>E. coli</i> C genome (the one we really need) and another
      representing phage phiX174 (a by product of Illumina sequencing where it
      is used as a spike-in DNA).</li> <li>Sequences have unwieldy names like
      `>1 length=4576293 depth=1.00x circular=true`. We need to rename it to
      something more meaningful.</li></ul> Let’s fix these two problems. Because
      phiX173 is around 5,000bp, we can remove those sequences by setting a
      minimum length of 10,000.

      By inspecting the result you can see that most alignments are short and

      Remember, our objective is to find the genomes that are most similar to
      ours. Given the alignment data in the table we just created we can define
      similarity as follows:<br><br> <i>Genomes that have the smallest number of
      alignment blocks but the highest overall alignment length are most similar
      to our assembly. This essentially means that they have longest
      uninterrupted region of high similarity to our assembly.</i><br><br>
      However, to extract this information from our data we need to aggregate
      it. In other words, for each <i>E. coli</i> genome we need to calculate
      the total number of alignment blocks, their combined length, and average
      identity.

      The dot plots we’ve produced above are great, but they are static. It
      would be wonderful to load these data into a genome browser where one can
      zoom in and out as well as add tracks such as those containing genes. To
      create a browser we need a genome and a set of tracks. Tracks are features
      such as genes or SNPs with start and end positions corresponding to a
      coordinate system provided by the genome. Thus the first thing to do is to
      create a genome that would represent our experiment. We can create such a
      genome by simply combining the three genomes of closely related strains
      with our assembly in a single dataset—a hybrid genome.<br><br> The first
      step will be collapsing the collection containing the three genomes into a
      single file.

      One of the fields chosen by us for <a
      href="https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/assembly/tutorials/ecoli_comparison/tutorial.html#hands_on-hands-on-aligning-again">LASTZ
      run</a> is <b>number</b>. This is an incrementing number given by LASTZ to
      every alignment block so it can be uniquely identified. The problem is
      that by running LASTZ on a collection of three genomes it generated a
      number for each output independently starting with <b>1</b> each time. So
      these alignments identified are unique within each individual run but are
      redundant for multiple runs. We can fix that by pre-pending each alignment
      identified (column 13) with the name of the target sequence (column 2).
      This would create alignments that are truly unique. For example, in the
      case of the LASTZ output shown above alignment identifier <b>1</b> will
      become `CP020543.11`, <b>2</b> will become `CP020543.12` and so on. Here
      is how we will do that.

      Let’s look again at the data we generated in the last step.<br>Alignments
      are regions of high similarity between two sequences. Therefore each
      alignment block has two sets of coordinates associated with it: start/end
      in the first sequences (target) and start/end in the second sequence
      (query). But BED only has one set of coordinates. Thus we can create two
      BEDs: one using coordinates from the target and the other one from query.
      To create the first BED we will cut six columns from the dataset produced
      at the last step. Specifically, to produce the target BED we will cut
      columns 2, 4, 5, 14, 12, and 8. To produce the query BED columns
      7,9,10,14,12,8 will be cut.

      than that of our assembly. This is why we will concentrate on the common
