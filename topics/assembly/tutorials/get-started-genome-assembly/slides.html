# Steps before starting a genome project

.left[
- Step 1: Build a wide community for the project if possible

- Step 2: Gather information about the target genome

- Step 3: Select the best possible DNA source and extraction

- Step 5: Choose an appropriate sequencing technology

- Step 6: Check the computational resources and requirements

### Build a wide community for the project (*if it's possible*)

.left[
The aim of a genome project is to **sequence the entire target genome** for a wide **range of genomics applications**.
]

.left[
**Analyses**, **reanalyses** and **integration** of genomic and other phenotype information require:
]

- **Facilities:** Wet lab, sequencing, bioinformatics,…
- **Personnel:** Skill intensive
- **Software:** Knowledge intensive

.left[
{% icon warning %} Data storage, maintenance, transfer, and analysis costs will also likely remain substantial and represent an increasing proportion of overall sequencing costs in the future.
]

### Genome information: Genome size

**How to collect informations?**

- Flux cytometry
- Databases:
  - Fungi: [http://www.zbi.ee/fungalgenomesize](http://www.zbi.ee/fungalgenomesize)
  - Animals: [http://www.genomesize.com](http://www.genomesize.com)

### Genome information: GC content

.pull-left[
**Why?**

.left[
Sequencing is not random!
GC and AT rich regions are under-represented.
]


**How to solve?**
- Chemistry quirks
- Increase the sequencing depth
- Technologies combination (both long and short reads)
]

### Genome information: Ploidy level

.pull-right[
.image-55[
  ![Heterozigous genotype](../../images/ploidy.png)
]]

.pull-left[

**Ploidy (N):**

Number of sets of chromosomes in a cell


| Organism                  | Ploidy    |
|:--------------------------|:---------:|
| Bacteria                  | 1N        |
| Human, mouse, rat         | 2N        |
| Amphibians (*Xenopus*)    | 2N to 12N |
| Plants (wheat)            | 6N        |
| **Autopolyploid**         | .         |
| **Hybrids**               | .         |

]

**Higher ploidy -> harder to assemble => Increase of sequencing depth**

### Genome information: Heterozygosity level

.pull-left[
.left[
**Heterozygous:** Locus-specific,  diploid (2N) organism has two different alleles of a particular gene at the same locus
]]

.pull-right[
.image-100[

]]

.left[
**Heterozygosity** is a metric used to denote the probability an individual will be heterozygous for a particular allele
]

**Higher heterozygosity -> harder to assemble => Increase of sequencing depth**

### Genome information: Complexity aka repeats elements

.left[
**It is impossible to resolve repeats of length L unless you have reads longer than L**
]

Most common source of assembly errors:

]]

### Genome information: Others

- **Karyotype:** chromosome number
- **Sex chromosome system:** None, XY, ZW, UV,…
- **Purity:** possible presence of contaminants and/or symbionts?
- Is there any other **useful data (NCBI, SRA, ENA, etc)** that could improve my assembly?

---

### Genome information: Tips

.pull-left[
- **Flux cytometry** :  genome size and ploidy level
- **k-mer frequency from Illumina reads** : genome size, ploidy level, GC content, heterozygosity and even repeats composition!

### The best possible DNA

.left[
Select the best possible DNA source and extraction.
The extraction of **high-quality DNA** is the **most important** aspect of a successful genome project

The **lack of a good starting material** will limit the choice of sequencing technology and will **affect the quality of obtained data**
]

---

### The best possible DNA: Chemical purity of DNA

.left[
**Sample-related contaminants:**
- Polysaccharides
- Proteoglycans
- Proteins
- Secondary metabolites
- Polyphenols
- Humic acids
- Pigments
- Etc,...

All these contaminants **can impair the efficacy of library preparation** in any technology, especially true **for PCR-free libraries** (both PacBio and ONT)
]

---

### The best possible DNA: Quantity of DNA

.left[
Different technologies require different amount of DNA:
- Illumina and 10x > 3 ng
- BioNano > 200 ng
- ONT > 1 μg
- Dovetail (Hic) > 5 μg
- PacBio > 15 μg
]

---

### The best possible DNA: Structural integrity of DNA

.left[
High Molecular Weight (**HMW**) for Nanopore/PacBio (obtained mainly from fresh material)
]

---

### The best possible DNA: Tips

.left[
- Many *DNA extraction protocol* available for a lot of species/taxa (VGP, Darwin Tree of Life, Nanopore, PacBio, etc)
- **Keep DNA samples** from the same individual in case of library preparation/sequencing fail, need more coverage, new sequencing technology, etc
- Use a **single individual** and sequence a **haploid, highly inbred diploid** organism, or **isogenic** individual
]

---

### Appropriate sequencing technology

.left[
Mostly **dependant on the quantity and quality of DNA and the cost** but many parameters need to be considered prior to running an NGS experiment:

- Short versus long reads or both
- Read length
- Read quality/error rate
- Genome read coverage/depth
- Library preparation
- Downstream applications
]

---

### Appropriate sequencing technology: Primary assembly

.left[
- **Illumina:** short reads (up to 2x250bp) with high quality reads. Sequencing bias with AT/GC rich regions
- **IonTorrent:** short reads (up to 500bp) with medium quality reads
- **Nanopore:** long reads (average ~15kbp) with low quality reads. Errors are not randomly distributed!
- **PacBio:**
  - CLR: long reads (average ~20kbp) with low quality reads
  - HiFi: long reads (average ~15kbp) with high quality reads
]

---

### Appropriate sequencing technology: Scaffolding

.left[
- **HiC:** single or double **restriction enzyme fragmentation.** Need huge amount of coverage.
- **Omni-C: sequence-independent endonuclease**
]

---

### Appropriate sequencing technology: Short vs long reads

.pull-left[
Depending on the sequencing technology reads length and sequencing depth are different.
- More sequencing depth but shorter reads
- Longer reads but less sequencing depth

### Appropriate sequencing technology: Short vs long reads

.pull-left[
Reads accuracy differs depending on the sequencing technology:
- Illumina and PacBio HiFi: more accurate
- ONT and PacBio CLR: less accurate (but longer)

---

### Appropriate sequencing technology: Coverage versus depth

.left[
**Coverage:** fraction of the genome sequenced at least by one read

**Depth:** average number of reads that cover any given region

Intuitively, more reads should increase coverage and depth.

### Computational resources and requirements

.left[
To succeed you need to have **sufficient compute resources (CPUS, RAM, walltime and storage)**.
- The resource are **different** between:
  - Assembly
  - Annotation
  - Other analysis tools

- For genome **assembly:**
  - Running times and RAM increase with the **type** and **amount of data**
  - More data for large genomes, increase **running time/RAM/Storage**
  - Most of tools **running** on a **single node:** parallelized but not distributed

- For genome **annotation:**
  - Mapping/alignment of external data (RNA-seq, proteins) can be parallelized and distributed
  - Annotation process can be parallelized and distributed
]

### Typical sequencing strategies: Bacterial genomes

.left[
- PacBio CLR or Oxford Nanopore reads at 40-50x coverage, self-correction and/or hybrid correction (using Illumina data)
- PacBio HiFi reads at 20-30x coverage
- Illumina 2x250bp paired-end reads from MiSeq
]

---

### Typical sequencing strategies: Larger genomes

.left[
- PacBio CLR or Oxford Nanopore reads at 100x coverage, hybrid correction using Illumina data and scaffolding using HiC or Omni-C
- PacBio HiFi reads at 30x coverage and scaffolding using HiC or Omni-C
- PacBio HiFi reads at 30x coverage, 120x Oxford Nanopore ultra long reads
