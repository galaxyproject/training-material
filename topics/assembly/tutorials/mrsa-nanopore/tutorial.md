# Introduction


In this training you're going to make an assembly of data produced by
"Complete Genome Sequences of Eight Methicillin-Resistant
*Staphylococcus aureus* Strains Isolated from Patients in
Japan" from {% cite Hikichi_2019 %} which describes:

> Methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) is a major pathogen
causing nosocomial infections, and the clinical manifestations of MRSA
range from asymptomatic colonization of the nasal mucosa to soft tissue
infection to fulminant invasive disease. Here, we report the complete
genome sequences of eight MRSA strains isolated from patients in Japan.

# Background

Sequencing (determining of DNA/RNA nucleotide sequence) is used all over
the world for all kinds of analysis. The product of these sequencers are
reads, which are sequences of detected nucleotides. Depending on the
technique these have specific lengths (30-500bp) or using Oxford
Nanopore Technologies sequencing have much longer variable lengths.

# Quality Control

When assessing the fastq files all bases had their own quality (or Phred score)
represented by symbols. You can read more in our dedicated [Quality Control
Tutorial]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.md %}).

To assess the quality by hand would be too much work. That's why tools like
[NanoPlot](https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot) or
[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) are made,
which will generate a summary and plots of the data statistics. NanoPlot is
mainly used for long-read data, like ONT and PACBIO and FastQC for short read,
like Illumina and Sanger.

Depending on the analysis it could be possible that a certain quality or length
is needed. The reads can be filtered using the tool
[Filtlong](https://github.com/rrwick/Filtlong). In this training all reads
below 1000bp will be filtered.

Before doing any assembly, the first questions you should ask about your input
reads include:

- What is the coverage of my genome?
- How good are my reads?
- Do I need to ask/perform for a new sequencing run?
- Is it suitable for the analysis I need to do?

{: .hands_on}

In principle we just ran the NanoPlot 2 times. For this reason, we have two
reports we want to view and compare!

Comparing different output files is easier if we can view more than one dataset
simultaneously. The Scratchbook function allows us to build up a collection of
datasets that will be shown on the screen together.

{% snippet faqs/galaxy/features_scratchbook.md %}

Open both NanoPlot HTML Reports and check the **General summary** section of each to compare the results:

{: .question}

While there is currently no community consensus over
the best trimming or filtering practices with long read data, there are still
some steps that can be beneficial to do for the assembly process.
{% tool [Porechop](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/porechop/porechop/0.2.3) %}
is a commonly used tool for removing adapter sequences, and we used
{% tool [filtlong](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/filtlong/filtlong/0.2.0) %}
for removing shorter reads which might make the assembly process more difficult.

# Assembly

When the quality of the reads is determined and the data is filtered (like we
did with filtlong) and/or trimmed (like is more often done with short read data)
an assembly can be made.

There are many tools that create assembly for long-read data, but in this
tutorial [Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye) will be used. Flye is a de
novo assembler for single molecule sequencing reads. It can be used from
bacteria to human assemblies. The Flye assembly is based on finding overlapping
reads with variable length with high error tolerance. Flye will output the
assembly in a .fasta file, which looks like a .fastq file without the 3rd and
4th line for the "+" sign and the quality score.

## QC

[Quast](http://quast.bioinf.spbau.ru/) ({% cite Gurevich2013 %})
is a tool providing quality metrics for assemblies, and can also be used
to compare multiple assemblies. The tool can also take an optional
reference file as input, and will provide complementary metrics. QUAST
stands for QUality ASsessment Tool. With later updates gene annotation
also possible with QUAST.

One can see that there are two contigs. The largest contig is 2,927,008
bp (for comparison [MRSA Isolate HC1335
Strain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5174738/) genome
length was 2,976,370 bp) and the smallest is 2,987,958 (total length) -
2,927,008 (length of the largest) = 60,950 bp. sequencing. The length of
the largest contig can mean that it is the total chromosomal DNA of the *S. aureus*.

# Identification of AMR Genes

Because we are working with a MRSA we are curious to see which resistance genes are located on the genome or on the plasmid. To determine whether the contigs contain antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes [staramr](https://github.com/phac-nml/staramr) can be used  **Staramr** scans bacterial genome contigs against both the **ResFinder** ({% cite Zankari2012 %}), **PointFinder** ({% cite Zankari2017 %}), and **PlasmidFinder** ({% cite Carattoli2014 %}) databases (used by the ResFinder webservice) and compiles a summary report of detected antimicrobial resistance genes.

>    - For the plasmid and resistance results the identity, overlap, length and the location on the contig can be found here.
>    - Multiple rep sequences are located on the second contig. (See "plasmid typing for gram-positive bacteria" {% cite Lozano_2012 %} for more information)

## CARD database

To get more information about these antibiotic resistant genes, you can check the [CARD database](https://card.mcmaster.ca) (**C**omprehensive **A**ntibiotic **R**esistance **D**atabase) ({% cite Jia2016 %})

![Screenshot of mecA sequence in CARD database with lots of metadata](../../images/mrsa/card.png "Screenshot of the CARD database interface. CARD gives information about the antibiotic resistance genes, as well as links to relevant publications.")

CARD can be very helpful to check all the resistance genes and check if
it is logical to find the resistance gene in a specific bacteria.

## Gene annotation using Prokka

[Prokka](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka/blob/master/README.md) is a
tool software tool to rapidly annotate bacterial, archaeal and viral
genomes. Prokka will be used on your own made genome (assembly). Prokka
will try to annotate the bacteria based on related species and starting
codons can be chosen or default of the species can be used.

[JBrowse](https://jbrowse.org/docs/tutorial.html) is used to visualize
your genome file and merge multiple outputs.\
In this case you will use your assembly as your reference and the output
from prokka as an information track.

If it takes too long to build the JBrowse instance, you can view an embedded one here. (**Warning**: feature name search will not work.)

{% snippet topics/visualisation/faqs/visualizations_jbrowse.html datadir="data" tracks="DNA,d6de62f94b0de381be4ee8f27dd61ab9_0,81dca2c0e6930aa541a1a88927ed51dd_0" %}

A useful option is the "search features" option

1. Under the **View** menu click on the **Search Features** option

   ![Screenshot of jbrowse top menu with search features button](../../images/mrsa/search-features.png)

   Now we are going to search for the aac(6')-aph(2'') gene (the resistance gene we found with the staramr (resfinder) results)

2. Type in the search bar: aac(6')-aph(2'')

   You won't find any results, because the names can be different for different database.

3. Now only type: `aac` and you'll find multiple results.

4. Now go back to the staramr (resfinder) results and check the starting position of the aac(6')-aph(2'') genes match the prokka results.

5. You can also use the location from the resfinder results by typing
   your coordinates, and you also can highlight specific
   parts.

   For example if an aac(6')-aph(2'') region was found on contig_2 with start 39209 and end 37755, you could write `contig_2:39209..37755` in the search box to go directly to that region.

6. After browsing to the region, under **view** press **Set highlight** and use the current region

   Now you can easily see that the aac(6')-aph(2'') gene in
   resfinder is much bigger than the genes found by prokka.

   So always know what you're searching for and specify which tools
   were used with which databases!

In this tutorial Jbrowse was only used for showing the locations of your
found genes, but it can be used with many more inputs.
