### &lt;i class=&quot;far fa-question-circle&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;question&lt;/span&gt; Questions


- What are the main types of assembly algorithms?

- How do they perform with short and long reads?

- How to improve assemblies using other technologies?


---




# Different types of input data

* Short reads (Illumina): numerous 👍, high quality 👍, cheap 👍, short 👎
* Long reads (PacBio, Nanopore): longer 👍, fewer 👎, (many) more errors 👎

Genome Assembly can be done with:
* only short reads
* only long reads
* both (hybrid assembly)

Specific algorithms for each

---

# Genome Assembly algorithms

Detect overlaps between reads to build the longest possible sequences

Algorithms use graphs to represent overlapping reads/words

Two steps:

* Build a (huge) graph while reading the input data
* Try to find the longest paths traversing the graph

Two main types of algorithms:

* Short reads: de Bruijn Graphs
* Long reads: OLC (Overlap Layout Consensus)

---

# OLC (Overlap Layout Consensus)

The older, first used for Sanger sequencing

Compare all reads, look for read overlaps

If a *suffix* of one read is similar to a *prefix* of another read...

```
TCTATATCTCGGCTCTAGG    &lt;- read 1
    ||||||| |||||||
    TATCTCGACTCTAGGCC  &lt;- read 2
```

...then they may overlap within the genome.

---

## Directed graphs

We build a *directed graph* where directed *edges* connect *nodes* representing overlapping reads:
![Image showing example reads represented as nodes, and an overlap between two reads as an edge](../../images/dag.png)

&gt;**Directed graph** representing overlapping reads. (Image from [Ben Langmead](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~langmea/resources/lecture_notes/assembly_scs.pdf)).

---

## Directed graphs

For example, consider these 15 three letter reads:

TAA AAT ATG TGC GCC CCA CAT ATG TGG GGG GGA GAT ATG TGT GTT

We&apos;re lucky, we know the corresponding genome sequence is TAATGCCATGGGATGTT

So the 15 reads can be represented as the following directed graph:

![A graph representing the 15 overlapping example reads](../../images/4.6.png)

---

**However**, in real life we do not know the actual genome! All we have is a collection of reads. Let&apos;s first build an overlap graph by connecting two 3-mers if suffix of one is equal to the prefix of the other:


&gt;![All possible overlap connections for our 3-mer collection](../../images/4.7.png)
&gt;
&gt;**Overlap graph**. All possible overlap connections for our 3-mer collection. (Fig. 4.7 from [CP](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/))

So to determine the sequence of the underlying genome we are looking for a path in this graph that visits every node (3-mer) once. Such path is called [Hamiltonian path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path) and it may not be unique.

---

For example for our 3-mer collection there are two possible Hamiltonian paths:

![First possible Hamiltonian path](../../images/4.9a.png)
![Second possible Hamiltonian path](../../images/4.9b.png)

**Two Hamiltonian paths for the 15 3-mers**. Edges spelling &quot;genomes&quot; &lt;code&gt;TAATGCCATGGGATGTT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TAATGGGATGCCATGTT&lt;/code&gt; are highlighted in black. (Fig. 4.9. from [[CP](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/)](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/)).

---

The reason for this &quot;duality&quot; is the fact that we have a *repeat*: 3-mer &lt;code&gt;ATG&lt;/code&gt; is present three times in our data (&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/font&gt;, &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/font&gt;, and &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/font&gt;). Repeats cause a lot of trouble in genome assembly.

---

# Limits of OLC

* Computationally intensive
* Doesn&apos;t perform well with Illumina (massive amount of short reads)

=&gt; deBruijn Graphs

---

# **de Bruijn Graphs**

Based on a counter-intuitive idea

* Hash all reads in overlapping fixed-length words
* Words = k-mers of size k
* Build a directed graph where nodes are k-mers and edges represent overlaps between k-mers

---

# **What are K-mers?**
![K-mers are subwords of length k of a string](../../images/kmers01.png)

# **Choose k wisely**

* Lower k
  * More connections
  * Less chance of resolving small repeats
  * Higher k-mer coverage

* Higher k
  * Less connections
  * More chance of resolving small repeats
  * Lower k-mer coverage

***Optimum value for k will balance these effects.***

# Coverage (or sequencing depth)

The number of unique reads that contain a given nucleotide in the reconstructed sequence.

![Aligned reads showing the notion of coverage](../../images/coverage.png)

Source: [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Read,_read_length_and_read_depth_to_achieve_a_read_depth)

**Estimated coverage**

**(number of reads x read length)** / **estimated size of the genome**

1,000,000 reads x 150bp / 10Mb = **15X**

---
# **More coverage**

* Errors won&apos;t be duplicated in every read
* Most reads will be error free
* We can count the frequency of each k-mer
* Annotate the graph with the frequencies
* Use the frequency data to clean the de Bruijn graph


***More coverage depth will help overcome errors!***
---
# **Read errors revisited**
![Graph annotated with coverage](../../images/ex3a.png)

---

# **de Bruijn graph assembly process**

1. Select a value for k
2. &quot;Hash&quot; the reads (make the kmers)
3. Count the kmers
4. Make the de Bruijn graph
5. Perform graph simplification steps
6. Read off contigs from simplified graph

---
# **Make contigs**

* Find an unbalanced node in the graph
* Follow the chain of nodes and &quot;read off&quot; the bases to produce the contigs
* Where there is an ambiguous divergence/convergence, stop the current contig and start a new one.
* Re-trace the reads through the contigs to help with repeat resolution

# Assembly in real life

In this topic we&apos;ve learned about two ways of representing the relationship between reads derived from a genome we are trying to assemble:

1. **Overlap graphs** - nodes are reads, edges are overlaps between reads.
2. **De Bruijn graphs** - nodes are overlaps, edges are reads.

---

# Overlap graph

![An example overlap graph](../../images/4.7.png)

---

# de Bruijn Graph - same data

![An example de Bruijn graph](../../images/4.13f.png)

---

Whatever the representation will be it will be messy:

![An example of a real-life, noisy graph](../../images/t12_mess.png)

A fragment of a very large De Bruijn graph (Image from [BL](https://github.com/BenLangmead/ads1-slides/blob/master/0580_asm__practice.pdf)).

---


There are multiple reasons for such messiness:

**Sequence errors**

Sequencing machines do not give perfect data. This results in spurious deviations on the graph. Some sequencing technologies such as Oxford Nanopore have very high error rate of ~15%.

&gt;![Zoom on graph region containing sequencing errors](../../images/t12_errors.png)
&gt;
&gt;Graph components resulting from sequencing errors (Image from [BL](https://github.com/BenLangmead/ads1-slides/blob/master/0580_asm__practice.pdf)).

---

**Ploidy**

As we discussed earlier humans are diploid and there are multiple differences between maternal and paternal genomes. This creates &quot;bubbles&quot; on assembly graphs:

&gt;![Impact of diploid genome sequencing on graphs](../../images/t12_bubble.png)
&gt;
&gt;Bubbles due to a heterozygous site  (Image from [BL](https://github.com/BenLangmead/ads1-slides/blob/master/0580_asm__practice.pdf)).

---

**Repeats**

As we&apos;ve seen the third law of assembly is unbeatable. As a result some regions of the genome simply cannot be resolved and are reported in segments called *contigs*:

&gt;![Impact of repeats on graphs](../../images/t12_contigs.png)
&gt;
&gt;The following &quot;genomic&quot; segment will be reported in three pieces corresponding to regions flanking the repeat and repeat itself (Image from [BL](https://github.com/BenLangmead/ads1-slides/blob/master/0580_asm__practice.pdf)).

---

# What to do with my reads?

* Short reads =&gt; DBG assemblers (e.g. Spades, ABySS, DISCOVAR, Velvet, ...)
* Long reads =&gt; OLC assemblers (e.g Canu, Falcon, Hgap4, ...)
* Short + Long reads =&gt; hybrid assemblers (e.g. Unicycler, ...)

Hybrid assembly: long reads to resolve repeats, short reads to correct errors

Other data and tools for polishing (scaffolding, gap filling, ...)

# Other data: Optical maps
