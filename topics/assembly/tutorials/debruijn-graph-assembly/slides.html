<hr>
* To be able to use de Bruijn graphs, we need reads of length **L** to overlap by **L-1** bases.
* Not all reads will overlap another read perfectly.
  * Read errors
  * Coverage "holes"
* Not all reads are the same length (depending on technology and quality cleanup)

***To help us get around these problems, we use all k-length subsequences of the reads, these are the k-mers.***

* Errors won't be duplicated in every read
* Most reads will be error free
* We can count the frequency of each k-mer
* Annotate the graph with the frequencies
* Use the frequency data to clean the de Bruijn graph

1. Select a value for k
2. "Hash" the reads (make the kmers)
3. Count the kmers
4. Make the de Bruijn graph
5. **Perform graph simplification steps** - use cov cutoff
6. Read off contigs from simplified graph

## Step 3: Bubble collapsing

* Detect redundant paths through graph
* Compare the paths using sequence alignment
* If similar, merge the paths

# **Graph simplification**

## Step 4: Remove low coverage nodes

* Remove erroneous nodes and connections using the "coverage cutoff"
* Genuine short nodes will have a high coverage

---
.enlarge120[
# **Make contigs**

* Find an unbalanced node in the graph
* Follow the chain of nodes and "read off" the bases to produce the contigs
* Where there is an ambiguous divergence/convergence, stop the current contig and start a new one.
* Re-trace the reads through the contigs to help with repeat resolution

# **Velvet**

Velvet has two separate programs:


* Velveth
  * Makes the k-mers and
  * Efficiently counts (hashes) them
  * All in O(N) time


* Velvetg
  * Makes the graph - O(U) time. U = unique k-mers.
  * Simplifies it
  * Makes contigs - O(E) time. E = edges in graph

But: You need to choose **k** and **c** wisely!

# **Assembly Exercise #2**

* We will perform an optimised assembly using the Velvet Optimiser in Galaxy.
* The optimiser will pick a good value for **k** and **c**, and perform graph simplification for us.

.enlarge120[
* de Bruijn graph assembler by Pavel Pevzner's group out of St. Petersburg


* Uses multiple k-mers to build the graph
  * Graph has connectivity **and** specificity
  * Usually use a low, medium and high k-mer size together.


* Performs error correction on the reads first

* Maps reads back to the contigs and scaffolds as a check

* Under active development

* Much slower than Velvet
* Should be used in preference to Velvet now.
