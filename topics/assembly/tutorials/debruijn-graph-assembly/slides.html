* To be able to use de Bruijn graphs, we need reads of length **L** to overlap by **L-1** bases.
* Not all reads will overlap another read perfectly.
  * Read errors
  * Coverage &quot;holes&quot;
* Not all reads are the same length (depending on technology and quality cleanup)

***To help us get around these problems, we use all k-length subsequences of the reads, these are the k-mers.***

1. Select a value for k
2. &quot;Hash&quot; the reads (make the kmers)
3. Count the kmers
4. Make the de Bruijn graph
5. **Perform graph simplification steps** - use cov cutoff
6. Read off contigs from simplified graph

# **Graph simplification**]

## Step 1: Chain merging

![Looking at a doubly connected graph with forward/reverse sequences and piles of overlaps. Nodes are connected with lines. One node is labelled as already merged, and two nodes sharing a prefix are labelled as further merging possible.](../../images/tipclipping.png)

---
.enlarge120[
# **Graph simplification**]

## Step 2: Tip clipping

![a graph with every node doubled for forward/reverse strands is shown, clip tips if the length of the tip of the node is less than 2 times k.](../../images/shortnodes.png)

.enlarge120[
# **Graph simplification**]


.pull-left[
![Three graphs are shown, B, C, and D. B is the most complex, C combines two nodes B and B prime, while D collapses even more nodes to further simplify the graph.](../../images/bubblemerging.png)
]
.pull-right[
## Step 3: Bubble collapsing

* Detect redundant paths through graph
* Compare the paths using sequence alignment
* If similar, merge the paths

.reduce70[Image: Zerbino &amp; Birney 2008]
]

---
.enlarge120[
# **Graph simplification**

## Step 4: Remove low coverage nodes

* Remove erroneous nodes and connections using the &quot;coverage cutoff&quot;
* Genuine short nodes will have a high coverage

]
---
.enlarge120[
# **Make contigs**

* Find an unbalanced node in the graph
* Follow the chain of nodes and &quot;read off&quot; the bases to produce the contigs
* Where there is an ambiguous divergence/convergence, stop the current contig and start a new one.
* Re-trace the reads through the contigs to help with repeat resolution

]

---
.enlarge120[
# **Velvet**

Velvet has two separate programs:


* Velveth
  * Makes the k-mers and
  * Efficiently counts (hashes) them
  * All in O(N) time


* Velvetg
  * Makes the graph - O(U) time. U = unique k-mers.
  * Simplifies it
  * Makes contigs - O(E) time. E = edges in graph

But: You need to choose **k** and **c** wisely!

# **Velvet - Paired end scaffolding**

* Breadcrumb algorithm
]

![Two boxes A and B are at opposite ends, there are many nodes along a line between them, and some sitting outside of the graph or otherwise weirdly connected.](../../images/breadcrumb.png)

.enlarge120[
# **Extensions of the idea**
]
---
.enlarge120[
# **SPAdes**     .pull-right[.image-50[![spades logo](../../images/spades.png)]]]

.enlarge120[
* de Bruijn graph assembler by Pavel Pevzner's group out of St. Petersburg


* Uses multiple k-mers to build the graph
  * Graph has connectivity **and** specificity
  * Usually use a low, medium and high k-mer size together.


* Performs error correction on the reads first

* Maps reads back to the contigs and scaffolds as a check

* Under active development

* Much slower than Velvet
* Should be used in preference to Velvet now.

]

.enlarge120[
# **A move back to OLC**]

.pull-left[
.enlarge120[
* New long read technologies
  * PacBio and MinIon


* Assemblers: HGap, CANU
  * Use overlap, layout consensus approach


* CANU can perform hybrid assemblies with long and short reads
]

### &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-key&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;keypoints&lt;/span&gt; Key points


- We learned about how the choice of k-mer size will affect assembly outcomes

- We learned about the strategies that assemblers use to make reference genomes

- We performed a number of assemblies with Velvet and SPAdes.

- You should use SPAdes or another more modern assembler than Velvet for actual assemblies now.
