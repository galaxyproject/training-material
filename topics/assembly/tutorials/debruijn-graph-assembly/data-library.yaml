  description: DNA sequence data has become an indispensable tool for Molecular Biology
    & Evolutionary Biology. Study in these fields now require a genome sequence to
    work from. We call this a 'Reference Sequence.' We need to build a reference for
    each species. We do this by Genome Assembly. De novo Genome Assembly is the process
    of reconstructing the original DNA sequence from the fragment reads alone.
