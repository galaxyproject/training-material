### Genome annotation

- Classifies and describes parts of the genome sequence
- Focusing on genes: their positions, names and functions
- Automatic methods to annotate a newly sequenced and assembled genome

???

- Annotating a genome means positioning features along the sequence of a genome.
- Here we focus on genes.
- We are interested in their positions, and functional annotation like their name of their function.
- Many software tools and pipelines exist to automatically perform the annotation of a new genome sequence.
- For example Prokka or Maker are widely used, and tutorials are available on the GTN to learn how to use them.
