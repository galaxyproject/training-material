## What you can find:

- Pretrained AI models to perform bioimage analysis tasks.
- Reference datasets used to train the models (and to test them!)
- Python notebooks to train or fine-tune your models.

???
In the Bioimage Model Zoo you can find pretrained models to perform different bioimage analysis tasks as well as reference datasets used to train the models.
Between many different tools and softwares, you can also find python notebooks to train or fine-tune your models easily.

## Why is it worth trying?

You can easily run any of the models in user-friendly tools such as Ilastik, deepImageJ, ZeroCostDL4Mic, ImJoy, Fiji, Icy, QuPath or more.

### BioImage Model Zoo: Models

![BioImage Model Zoo Model Cards](../../images/welcome-bioimageio-05.png "BioImage Model Zoo Model Cards")

???
In each model card you can find interactive buttons and the description of the model itself. These buttons will provide you some of the features of that model such as the training dataset or the license.
You can also choose the consumer software to run the model, share this model, download it and more.
