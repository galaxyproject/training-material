title: Single Cell
summary: |
  Training material and practicals for all kinds of single cell analysis (particularly scRNA-seq!). When you generate your lovely gene lists for your cells, consider checking out our Transcriptomics tutorials for further network analysis!

  What else do you want to see? You can submit tool and/or tutorial request on our <i class="fa fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Single Cell Community Tool Request Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15hqgqA-RMDhXR-ylKhRF-Dab9Ij2arYSKiEVoPl2df4/edit?usp=sharing).

    title: "Case study"
    description: "These tutorials take you from raw scRNA sequencing reads to inferred trajectories to replicate a published analysis. The data is messy. The decisions are tough. The interpretation is meaningful. Come here to advance your single cell skills! Note that you get two options for inferring trajectories."

    title: "Case study: Reloaded"
    description: "These tutorials let you follow the same case study analysis of real, messy data but in a programming environment, hosted on Galaxy. So if you want more flexibility, but the same guided steps as the Case Study, you can skip the Case Study and start here instead. Alternatively, try these after completing the Case Study for an easier jump to a coding environment."
