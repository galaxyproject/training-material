{% icon feedback %} To discuss with like-minded scientists, join our [Galaxy Training Network chatspace in Slack](http://gxy.io/gtn-slack) and discuss with fellow users of Galaxy single cell analysis tools on [#single-cell-users](https://gtnsmrgsbord.slack.com/archives/C06PBRR40D7)

We also post new tutorials / workflows there from time to time, as well as any other news.
