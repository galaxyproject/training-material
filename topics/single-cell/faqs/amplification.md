Due to the extremely small amount of starting material, the initial amplification is likely to be uneven due to the first cycle of amplified products being overrepresented in the second cycle of amplification leading to further bias. In Bulk RNA-seq, the larger selection of RNA molecules to amplify, evens out the odds that any one transcript will be amplified more than others.
