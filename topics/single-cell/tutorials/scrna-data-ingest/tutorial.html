                <p>You finally decided to analyse some single cell data, you got your files either from the lab or publicly available sources, you opened the first tutorial available on Galaxy Training Network and… you hit the wall! The format of your files is not compatible with the one used in tutorial! Have you been there? 
This tutorial was created to help you overcome that problem and ensure data interoperability in single cell analysis. Once you get your data into Galaxy in the right format, that’s already 50% of success. Additionally, by using format conversion, you will be able to use different packages presented in tutorials that may require different datatypes.</p>

<h1 id="single-cell-datatypes">Single cell datatypes</h1>

<p>To start with, here are the most common formats and datatypes that you might come across if you work with single cell data:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tabular</strong> - simply using TSV, CSV or TXT formats to store expression matrix as well as cell and gene metadata.</li>
  <li><strong>MTX</strong> - it’s just a sparse matrix format with genes on the rows and cells on the columns as output by Cell Ranger.</li>
  <li><strong>HDF5</strong> - Hierarchical Data Format - can store datasets and groups. A dataset is a  a multidimensional array of data elements, together with supporting metadata. A group is a structure for organizing objects in an HDF5 file. This format allows for storing both the count matrices and all metadata in a single file rather than having separate features, barcodes and matrix files.</li>
  <li><strong>AnnData objects</strong> - <a href="https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">anndata</a> is a Python package for handling annotated data matrices. In Galaxy, you’ll see AnnData objects in <strong>h5ad</strong> format, which is based on the standard HDF5 (h5) format. There are lots of Python tools that work with this format, such as Scanpy, MUON, Cell Oracle, SquidPy, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Loom</strong> - it is simply an HDF5 file that contains specific groups containing the main matrix as well as row and column attributes and can be read by any language supporting HDF5. <a href="https://linnarssonlab.org/loompy/">Loompy</a> has been released as a Python API to interact with loom files, and <a href="https://github.com/mojaveazure/loomR">loomR</a> is its implementation in R.</li>
  <li><strong>Zarr</strong> - a Python package providing an implementation of compressed, chunked, N-dimensional arrays, designed for use in parallel computing. The Zarr file format offers powerful compression options, supports multiple data store backends, and can read/write your NumPy arrays.</li>
  <li><strong>Seurat objects</strong> - a representation of single-cell expression data for R, in Galaxy you might see them in <strong>rdata</strong> format.</li>
  <li><strong>Single Cell Experiment (SCE) object</strong> - defines a S4 class for storing data from single-cell experiments and provides a more formalized approach towards construction and accession of data. The S4 system is one of R’s systems for object oriented programing. In Galaxy you might see SCE objects in <strong>rdata</strong> format.</li>
  <li><strong>CellDataSet (CDS) object</strong> - the main class used by Monocle to hold single cell expression data. In Galaxy you might see CDS objects in <strong>rdata</strong> format.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="data-import">Data import</h1>
<p>As you can see above, there are multiple ways to store single cell data. Therefore, there are also many ways how you can get that data! 
Obviously, before any format conversion, we need to import the data. In our tutorials we often use <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a> links, but you can also upload the files directly from your computer. There are also publicly available resources which you can easily access through public atlases, such as <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/home">Single Cell Expression Atlas</a> or <a href="https://data.humancellatlas.org/">Human Cell Atlas data portal</a>. We created a <a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/EBI-retrieval/tutorial.html">dedicated tutorial</a> to show how to use those atlases to retrieve data. But today we’re here to focus on data conversion!</p>

<h1 id="sceasy-tool">SCEasy Tool</h1>
<p>In Galaxy Toolshed there is a wonderful tool called <span class="tool" data-tool="toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/sceasy_convert/sceasy_convert/0.0.7+galaxy2" title="SCEasy tool" aria-role="button"><i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>SCEasy</strong> (<i class="fas fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> Galaxy version 0.0.7+galaxy2)</span> which allows you to convert between common single cell formats, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>AnnData to CellDataSet (CDS)</li>
  <li>AnnData to Seurat</li>
  <li>Loom to AnnData</li>
  <li>Loom to SingleCellExperiment (SCE)</li>
  <li>SingleCellExperiment (SCE) to AnnData</li>
  <li>SingleCellExperiment (SCE) to Loom</li>
  <li>Seurat to AnnData</li>
  <li>Seurat to SingleCellExperiment (SCE)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="warning">
  <div class="box-title warning-title" id="warning-two-sceasy-tools"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Warning: Two SCEasy tools</div>

  <p>As of the writing of this tutorial, the updated SCEasy tool is called <span class="tool" data-tool="toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/sceasy_convert/sceasy_convert/0.0.7+galaxy2" title="SCEasy Converter tool" aria-role="button"><i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>SCEasy Converter</strong> (<i class="fas fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> Galaxy version 0.0.7+galaxy2)</span> and it’s only available on <em>usegalaxy.eu</em>.

</blockquote>

<p>In this tutorial you will see multiple examples of SCEasy Tool in action. However, sometimes it is useful to know how to do this conversion manually or at least to know how it all works and better understand the structure of the files. Therefore, we also have examples showing how to convert objects manually or prepare the input files for some of our single cell tutorials and workflows.</p>

<h1 id="seurat---anndata">Seurat -&gt; AnnData</h1>
<p>As mentioned above, there are two SCEasy tools currently available. When we speak about conversion to AnnData, the latest tool <span class="tool" data-tool="toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/sceasy_convert/sceasy_convert/0.0.7+galaxy2" title="SCEasy Converter tool" aria-role="button"><i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>SCEasy Converter</strong> (<i class="fas fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> Galaxy version 0.0.7+galaxy2)</span> converts Seurat into the latest version of AnnData object. However, currently it is not possible to use that output with downstream EBI single-cell tools because they only support older versions of the AnnData. If you need to use those tools, the solution is to take advantage of the second SCEasy tool <span class="tool" data-tool="toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/ebi-gxa/sceasy_convert/sceasy_convert/0.0.5+galaxy1" title="SCEasy convert tool" aria-role="button"><i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>SCEasy convert</strong> (<i class="fas fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> Galaxy version 0.0.5+galaxy1)</span> which has limited conversion options but can generate AnnData files compatible with the EBI single-cell tools that we are going to use next in the workflow. 
Our Seurat starting file was generated by pulling data from <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/home">Single Cell Expression Atlas</a> and transforming it into the desired format, what was shown in the <a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/EBI-retrieval/tutorial.html">data import tutorial</a>. It will be our toy dataset.</p>

<h1 id="anndata---cell-data-set-cds">Anndata -&gt; Cell Data Set (CDS)</h1>
<p>Cell Data Set (CDS) format is usually used when working with a package called Monocle3 (<span class="citation"><a href="#monocle3">cole-trapnell-lab</a></span>). Below we show two methods on how to transform AnnData to CDS object, one of which creates an input file for <a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_monocle3-trajectories/tutorial.html">Monocle 3 tutorial</a>.</p>

		You can choose whether you want just to transform AnnData to CDS or to create CDS input file for Monocle3 tutorial to proceed with the downstream analysis described in that tutorial. Please note that depending on your dataset, you might need to refer to the first method which uses both annotated and unprocessed matrices. If you did some pre-processing on your AnnData object, then you might need to choose the first method anyway since Monocle3 performs its own pre-processing, so we would also need an unprocessed expression matrix alongside annotated (pre-processed) AnnData. That method is more expanded and specific, while the general one just shows the main principle of the conversion.

  <p>The <a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_monocle3-trajectories/tutorial.html">dedicated tutorial</a> shows how to perform trajectory analysis using Monocle3 which is the next step in the single-cell case study tutorial series, right after <a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_alevin-combine-datasets/tutorial.html">pre-processing tutorial</a> and <a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_basic-pipeline/tutorial.html">analysing the metadata</a>. To keep the continuity of the series, we will continue to work on the case study data from a mouse model of fetal growth restriction <span class="citation"><a href="#Bacon2018">Bacon <i>et al.</i> 2018</a></span> (see <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6945/results/tsne">the study in Single Cell Expression Atlas</a> and <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6945/">the project submission</a>). After successfully completing this section with the mentioned dataset, you can use it directly in the <a href="https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/j.jakiela/w/copy-of-trajectory-analysis-using-monocle3-1">Monocle3 tutorial workflow</a>.
If you work on your own data, you might also need to follow this method since it shows how to deal with already pre-processed datasets. Since Monocle3 performs its own pre-processing, you will need both annotated and unprocessed matrices.</p>

  <h2 id="get-data">Get data</h2>
  <p>Monocle3 works great with annotated data, so we will make use of our annotated AnnData object, generated in the <a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_basic-pipeline/tutorial.html">previous tutorial</a>. We will also need a ‘clean’ expression matrix, extracted from the AnnData object just before we started the processing.
You have two options for uploading these datasets. Importing via history is often faster.</p>

  <h2 id="extracting-annotations">Extracting annotations</h2>
  <p>To run Monocle, we need cell metadata, gene metadata, and an expression matrix file of genes by cells. (In theory, the expression matrix alone could do, but then we wouldn’t have all those useful annotations that we worked on so hard in the previous tutorials!). In order to get these files, we will extract the gene and cell annotations from our AnnData object.</p>

  <blockquote class="question">
    <div class="box-title question-title" id="question-2"><i class="far fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Question</div>

    <p>How many lines do you expect to be in the gene and cell metadata files?</p>

      <p>If you click on the step with uploaded annotated AnnData file, you will see on a small preview that this object has 8605 observations and 15395 variables, so we expect to get a cell metadata file with 8605 lines and gene metadata file with 15395 lines (without headers of course!).</p>

  <p>Quick and easy, isn’t it? However, we need to make some minor changes before we can input these files into the Monocle toolsuite.</p>

  <h2 id="cell-metadata">Cell metadata</h2>
  <p>Our current dataset is not just T-cells: as you might remember from the last tutorial, we identified a cluster of macrophages as well. This might be a problem, because the trajectory algorithm will try to find relationships between all the cells (even if they are not necessarily related!), rather than only the T-cells that we are interested in. We need to remove those unwanted cell types to make the analysis more accurate.</p>

  <p>The <strong>Manipulate AnnData</strong> tool allows you to filter observations or variables, and that would be the most obvious way to remove those cells. However, given that we don’t need an AnnData object, it’s a lot quicker to edit a table rather than manipulate an AnnData object. Ultimately, we need cell metadata, gene metadata and expression matrix files that have macrophages removed, and that have the correct metadata that Monocle looks for. With some table manipulation, we’ll end up with three separate files, ready to be passed onto Monocle3.</p>

  <h2 id="expression-matrix">Expression matrix</h2>
  <p>Last, but not least! And in fact, the most important! The expression matrix contains all the values representing the expression level of a particular gene in a cell. This is why in theory the expression matrix is the only input file required by Monocle3. Without annotation files the CDS data can still be generated - it will be quite bare and rather unhelpful for interpretation, but it’s possible to process.
So, the values in the expression matrix are just numbers. But do you remember that we have already done some processing such as normalisation and the calculation of principal components in the AnnData object in the previous tutorial? That affected our expression matrix. Preprocessing is one of the steps in the Monocle3 workflow, so we want to make sure that the calculations are done on a ‘clean’ expression matrix. If we apply too many operations on our raw data, it will be too ‘deformed’ to be reliable. The point of the analysis is to use algorithms that make the enormous amount of data understandable in order to draw meaningful conclusions in accordance with biology.
So how do we do that?</p>

  <p>As you can see, there are way more genes and cells in the unprocessed AnnData file, so the expression matrix is much bigger than we need it to be. If the genes and cells we prepared for Monocle3 are not the same as in the expression matrix, Monocle3 will crash. Therefore, we have to filter that big, clean matrix and adjust it to our already prepared genes and cells files. But first, let’s extract the matrix from the unprocessed AnnData object.</p>

  <p>If you have a look at the preview of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Unprocessed expression matrix</code>, you’ll see that the first column contains the cell barcodes, while the first row - the gene IDs. We would like to keep only the values corresponding to the cells and genes that are included in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cells input data for Monocle3</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Genes input data for Monocle3</code>. How do we do it? First, we compare the cell barcodes from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cells input data for Monocle3</code> to those in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Unprocessed expression matrix</code> and ask Galaxy to keep the values of the matrix for which the barcodes in both files are the same. Then, we’ll do the same for gene IDs. We will cut the first columns from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cells input data for Monocle3</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Genes input data for Monocle3</code> to be able to compare those columns side by side with the matrix file.</p>

    <p>Generally in coding you can use different ways to achieve the same result. Similarly, in Galaxy you can use different tools but the outcome will be the same.
For example, we could have used some tools on our starting AnnData object to remove macrophages and rename the column header, and afterwards extract observations and variables. It is a good practice to use methods from the libraries (such as Scanpy below) rather than dealing with text files rows and columns. The shown approach works well, but it might be problematic with much bigger datasets sizes. Then, you can use the following route:</p>

  <p>Hold on here! As mentioned, if you’re converting your files to CDS, you’ll probably be working with Monocle. There is one function in downstream analysis in Monocle that requires a specific name of the column containing gene symbols, and that is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gene_short_name</code>. If you use Galaxy buttons for the analysis, you won’t be able to change that name after you create CDS file, so a good piece of advice is to rename it at this stage. There is no harm in doing this, and it might save you some time and frustration later on. You only need to check which column contains the gene symbols and what is its header - you can check that in the preview window, simply by clicking on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Genes</code> dataset. In our case, that’s column 3 and its name is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Symbol</code>. Let’s change that!</p>

<p>Funnily enough, those files are already downsampled, so you won’t have to wait for too long to download them. We are not going to analyse that data anyway, it’s just for demonstration purposes.
Quickly check which file contains barcodes and which file contains transcripts. If you click on the two datasets, you will see that one has shorter sequences, while the other has longer. It’s quite straight-forward to deduce that shorter sequences are barcodes.</p>

<p>Now let’s select the number of the reads we would like to keep. It’s totally up to you, we choose <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">100000</code> here.</p>
