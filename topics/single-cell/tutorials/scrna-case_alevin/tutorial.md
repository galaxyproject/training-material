# Introduction


<!-- This is a comment. -->

This tutorial will take you from raw FASTQ files to a cell x gene data matrix in AnnData format. What's a data matrix, and what's AnnData format? Well you'll find out! Importantly, this is the first step in processing single cell data in order to start analysing it. Currently you have a bunch of strings of `ATGGGCTT` etc. in your sequencing files, and what you need to know is how many cells you have and what genes appear in those cells. These steps are the most computationally heavy in the single cell world, as you're starting with 100s of millions of reads, each with 4 lines of text. Later on in analysis, this data becomes simple gene counts such as 'Cell A has 4 GAPDHs', which is a lot easier to store! Because of this data overload, we have downsampled the FASTQ files to speed up the analysis a bit. Saying that, you're still having to map loads of reads to the massive murine genome, so get yourself a cup of coffee and prepare to analyse!

# Generating a matrix

In this section, we will show you the principles of the initial phase of single-cell RNA-seq analysis: generating expression measures in a matrix. We'll concentrate on droplet-based (rather than plate-based) methodology, since this is the process with most differences with respect to conventional approaches developed for bulk RNA-seq.

Droplet-based data consists of three components: cell barcodes, unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and cDNA reads. To generate cell-wise quantifications we need to:

 * Process cell barcodes, working out which ones correspond to 'real' cells, which to sequencing artefacts, and possibly correct any barcodes likely to be the product of sequencing errors by comparison to more frequent sequences.
 * Map biological sequences to the reference genome or transcriptome.
 * 'De-duplicate' using the UMIs.

This used to be a complex process involving multiple algorithms, or was performed with technology-specific methods (such as 10X's 'Cellranger' tool)  but is now much simpler thanks to the advent of a few new methods. When selecting methodology for your own work you should consider:

 * [STARsolo](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) - a droplet-based scRNA-seq-specific variant of the popular genome alignment method STAR. Produces results very close to those of Cellranger (which itself uses STAR under the hood).
 * [Kallisto/ bustools](https://www.kallistobus.tools/) - developed by the originators of the transcriptome quantification method, Kallisto.
 * [Alevin](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/alevin.html) - another transcriptome analysis method developed by the authors of the Salmon tool.

We're going to use Alevin {% cite article-Alevin %} for demonstration purposes, but we do not endorse one method over another.

## Get Data

We've provided you with some example data to play with, a small subset of the reads in a mouse dataset of fetal growth restriction {% cite Bacon2018 %} (see the [study in Single Cell Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6945/results/tsne) and the [project submission](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6945/)). This is a study using the Drop-seq chemistry, however this tutorial is almost identical to a 10x chemistry. We will point out the one tool parameter change you will need to run 10x samples. This data is not carefully curated, standard tutorial data - it's real, it's messy, it desperately needs filtering, it has background RNA running around, and most of all it will give you a chance to practice your analysis as if this data were yours.

Down-sampled reads and some associated annotation can be downloaded from Zenodo below, or you can import this [example input history](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/h/cs1pre-processing-with-alevin---input-1). How did I downsample these FASTQ files? Check out [this history](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/h/pre-processing-with-alevin---part-1---how-to-downsample) to find out!
Additionally, to map your reads, you will need a transcriptome to align against (a FASTA) as well as the gene information for each transcript (a gtf) file. You can download these for your species of interest [from Ensembe](https://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html). Additionally, these files are available in the above history as well as the Zenodo links below. Keep in mind, these are big files, so they may take a bit to import!

## Generate a transcript to gene map

Gene-level, rather than transcript-level, quantification is standard in scRNA-seq, which means that the expression level of alternatively spliced RNA molecules are combined to create gene-level values. Droplet-based scRNA-seq techniques only sample one end each transcript, so lack the full-molecule coverage that would be required to accurately quantify different transcript isoforms.

To generate gene-level quantifications based on transcriptome quantification, Alevin and similar tools require a conversion between transcript and gene identifiers. We can derive a transcript-gene conversion from the gene annotations available in genome resources such as Ensembl. The transcripts in such a list need to match the ones we will use later to build a binary transcriptome index. If you were using spike-ins, you'd need to add these to the transcriptome and the transcript-gene mapping.

In your example data you will see the murine reference annotation as retrieved from Ensembl in GTF format. This annotation contains gene, exon, transcript and all sorts of other information on the sequences. We will use these to generate the transcript/ gene mapping by passing that information to a tool that extracts just the transcript identifiers we need.

{: .question}

It's now time to parse the GTF file using the [rtracklayer](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rtracklayer.html) package in R. This parsing will give us a conversion table with a list of transcript identifiers and their corresponding gene identifiers for counting. Additionally, because we will be generating our own binary index (more later!), we also need to input our FASTA so that it can be filtered to only contain transcriptome information found in the GTF.

## Generate a transcriptome index & quantify!

Alevin collapses the steps involved in dealing with dscRNA-seq into a single process. Such tools need to compare the sequences in your sample to a reference containing all the likely transcript sequences (a 'transcriptome'). This will contain the biological transcript sequences known for a given species, and perhaps also technical sequences such as 'spike ins' if you have those.

> <details-title>How does Alevin work?</details-title>
>
> To be able to search a transcriptome quickly, Alevin needs to convert the text (FASTA) format sequences into something it can search quickly, called an 'index'. The index is in a binary rather than human-readable format, but allows fast lookup by Alevin. Because the types of biological and technical sequences we need to include in the index can vary between experiments, and because we often want to use the most up-to-date reference sequences from Ensembl or NCBI, we can end up re-making the indices quite often. Making these indices is time-consuming! Have a look at the uncompressed FASTA to see what it starts with.

We now have:

* Barcode/ UMI reads
* cDNA reads
* transcript/ gene mapping
* filtered FASTA

We can now run Alevin. In some public instances, Alevin won't show up if you search for it. Instead, you may have to click the Single Cell tab at the left and scroll down to the Alevin tool. Alternatively, use Tutorial Mode as described above and you'll easily navigate to all the tools, and their versions will all be the tried and tested ones of this tutorial. It's often a good idea to check your tool versions. In this case the tutorial was built with Alevin Galaxy Version 1.5.1+galaxy0. To identify which version of a tool you are using. Select {% icon tool-versions %} 'Versions' and choose the appropriate version.

This tool will take a while to run. Alevin produces many file outputs, not all of which we'll use. You can refer to the [Alevin documentation](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/alevin.html) if you're curious what they all are, but we're most interested in is:

* the matrix itself (quants_mat.mtx.gz - the count by gene and cell)
* the row (cell/ barcode) identifiers (quants_mat_rows.txt) and
* the column (gene) labels (quants_mat_cols.txt).

This is the matrix market (MTX) format.

The overall mapping rate of the file is more like 50%, which is still quite poor, but for early Drop-Seq samples and single-cell data in general, you might expect a slightly poorer mapping rate. 10x samples are much better these days!

{% icon congratulations %} Congratulations - you've made an expression matrix! We could almost stop here. But it's sensible to do some basic QC, and one of the things we can do is look at a barcode rank plot.

# Basic QC

The question we're looking to answer here, is: "do we mostly have a single cell per droplet"? That's what experimenters are normally aiming for, but it's not entirely straightforward to get exactly one cell per droplet. Sometimes almost no cells make it into droplets, other times we have too many cells in each droplet. At a minimum, we should easily be able to distinguish droplets with cells from those without.

![raw droplet barcode plots-400k](../../images/scrna-casestudy/wab-raw_barcodes-400k.png "400k subsample raw")

Now, the image generated here (400k) isn't the most informative - but you are dealing with a fraction of the reads! If you run the total sample (so identical steps above, but with significantly more time!) you'd get the image below.

![raw droplet barcode plots-total](../../images/scrna-casestudy/wab-raw_barcodes-total.png "Total sample - 32,579,453 reads - raw")

This is our own formulation of the barcode plot based on a [discussion](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/362#issuecomment-490160480) we had with community members. The left hand plots with the smooth lines are the main plots, showing the UMI counts for individual cell barcodes ranked from high to low. We expect a sharp drop-off between cell-containing droplets and ones that are empty or contain only cell debris. Now, this data is not an ideal dataset, so for perspective, in an ideal world with a very clean 10x run, data will look a bit more like the following taken from the lung atlas (see the [study in Single Cell Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6653/results/tsne) and the [project submission](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6653/)).

![raw droplet barcode plots - lung atlas](../../images/scrna-casestudy/wab-lung-atlas-barcodes-raw.png "Pretty data - raw")

In that plot, you can see the clearer 'knee' bend, showing the cut-off between empty droplets and cell-containing droplets.

The right hand plots are density plots from the first one, and the thresholds are generated either using [dropletUtils](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DropletUtils.html) or by the method described in the discussion mentioned above. We could use any of these thresholds to select cells, assuming that anything with fewer counts is not a valid cell. By default, Alevin does something similar, and we can learn something about that by plotting just the barcodes Alevin retains.

And the full sample looks like:

![raw droplet barcode plots - total](../../images/scrna-casestudy/wab-alevin-barcodes-total.png "Total sample - 32,579,453 reads - Alevin processed")

And to round this off, here's the lung atlas plot.

![raw droplet barcode plots - total](../../images/scrna-casestudy/wab-alevin-barcodes-lung.png "Pretty data - Alevin processed")

You should see a completely vertical drop-off where Alevin has trunctated the distribution (after excluding any cell barcode that had <10 UMI, Alevin then chose a threshold based off the curve and removed all barcodes with fewer UMIs).

In experiments with relatively simple characteristics, this 'knee detection' method works relatively well. But some populations (such as our sample!) present difficulties. For instance, sub-populations of small cells may not be distinguished from empty droplets based purely on counts by barcode. Some libraries produce multiple 'knees' for multiple sub-populations. The [emptyDrops](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1662-y) method has become a popular way of dealing with this. emptyDrops still retains barcodes with very high counts, but also adds in barcodes that can be statistically distinguished from the ambient profiles, even if total counts are similar. In order to ultimately run emptyDrops (or indeed, whatever tool you like that accomplishes biologically relevant thresholding), we first need to re-run Alevin, but prevent it from applying its own less than ideal thresholds.

To use emptyDrops effectively, we need to go back and re-run Alevin, stopping it from applying it's own thresholds. Click the re-run icon {% icon galaxy-refresh %} on any Alevin output in your history, because almost every parameter is the same as before, except you need to change the following:

Alevin outputs MTX format, which we can pass to the dropletUtils package and run emptyDrops. Unfortunately the matrix is in the wrong orientation for tools expecting files like those produced by 10X software (which dropletUtils does). We need to 'transform' the matrix such that cells are in columns and genes are in rows.

The output is a matrix in the correct orientation for the rest of our tools. However, our matrix is looking a bit sparse - for instance, click on `Gene table`. I don't know about you, but I'd struggle to have a good biological discussion using only Ensembl gene_ids! What I'd really like is the more understandable 'GAPDH' or other gene acronym, as well as information on mitochondrial genes so that I can assess if my cells were stressed out or not. In order to prepare our data for emptyDrops, we're going to combine this information into an object, and it's easiest to add in that information now.

We're now going to re-run {% icon galaxy-refresh %} the tool that extracts information from our GTF file.

Inspect {% icon galaxy-eye %} the **Gene Information** object in the history. Now you have made a new key for gene_id, with gene name and a column of mitochondrial information (false = not mitochondrial, true = mitochondrial). We need to add this information into the salmonKallistoMtxTo10x output 'Gene table'. But we need to keep 'Gene table' in the same order, since it is referenced in the 'Matrix table' by row.

Inspect {% icon galaxy-eye %} your `Annotated Gene Table`. That's more like it! You now have `gene_id`, `gene_name`, and `mito`. Now let's get back to your journey to emptyDrops and sophisticated thresholding of empty droplets!

# emptyDrops

emptyDrops {% cite article-emptyDrops %} works with a specific form of R object called a SingleCellExperiment. We need to convert our transformed MTX files into that form, using the DropletUtils Read10x tool:

{: .hands_on}

Fantastic! Now that our matrix is combined into an object, specifically the SingleCellExperiment format, we can now run emptyDrops! Let's get rid of those background droplets containing no cells!

If you look at the barcode plots above for the 400k read sample, you'll see this is far too stringent for this subsampled data! To satisfy your curiosity, this minimum threshold would yield `4332` barcodes for the total sample. Also, the number may vary slightly as the output depends on a large number of random iterations.

We will nevertheless proceed with your majestic annotated expression matrix of 37 cells, ready to go for further processing and analysis! However, the next tutorials we will link to use a tool suite called Scanpy {% cite Wolf2018 %}. You need to convert this SingleCellExperiment object into a format called `annData`, which is a variant of a file format called `hdf5`.

{% icon congratulations %} Congrats! Your object is ready to for the scanpy pipeline! You can can check your work against the [example history](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/h/cs1pre-processing-with-alevin---answer-key), or compare how the subsampled datasets you've generated compare with the [total sample](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/h/cs1pre-processing-with-alevin---total-n701-answer-key)

However, it may be that you want to combine this object with others like it, for instance, maybe you ran 5 samples, and you are starting with 10 FASTQ files...

# Analysing multiple FASTQ files

This sample was originally one of seven. So to run the other [12 downsampled FASTQ files](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/h/alevin-tutorial---all-samples---400k), you can use a [workflow](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/w/cs1generating-a-single-cell-matrix-using-alevin) and run them all at once! All these samples are going to take a while, so go and have several cups of tea... Or, better yet, I have [run them myself](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/h/cs1generating-a-single-cell-matrix-using-alevin---all-downsample-fastq-processed-to-anndata). To combine the resultant files into a single matrix, you can look at the next tutorial in this case study: [Combining datasets after pre-processing]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_alevin-combine-datasets/tutorial.md %})

# Mitochondrial flagging

We have assumed you will be combining multiple files - but if that's not the case, you'll need to perform this step to turn your column of `true` and `false` labelling the mitochondrial genes into some metrics telling you the % of mitochondrial genes in each cell. You can follow that step here: [Mitochondrial calculations](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-case_alevin-combine-datsets#mitochondrial-reads).

# Conclusion


![Workflow Part 1](../../images/scrna-casestudy/wab-alevin-part1workflow.png "Workflow  - Steps 1-3")

We have:

 * Examined raw read data, annotations and necessary input files for quantification.
 * Run Alevin in two different parameterisations, both allowing Alevin to make its own calls on what constitutes empty droplets, and applying emptyDrops instead.
 * Deployed barcode rank plots as a way of quickly assessing the signal present in droplet datasets.
 * Applied the necessary conversion to pass these data to downstream processes.
