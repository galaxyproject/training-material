Therefore the first parameter <code style=\"color: inherit\">-g</code> stands for “gtf-file” and requires a path to a valid GTF file. Then <code style=\"color: inherit\">-c</code> takes a cDNA file for extracting meta info and/or filtering - that’s our FASTA! Where –parse-cdnas (that’s our <code style=\"color: inherit\">-c</code>) is specified, we need to specify, using <code style=\"color: inherit\">-d</code>, which field should be used to compare to identfiers from the FASTA. We set that to “transcript_id” - feel free to inspect the GTF file to explore other attributes. We pass the same value in <code style=\"color: inherit\">-f</code>, meaning first-field, ie. the name of the field to place first in output table. To specify which other fields to retain in the output table, we provide comma-separated list of those fields, and since we’re only interested in transcript to gene map, we put those two names (“transcript_id,gene_id”) into <code style=\"color: inherit\">-l</code>. <code style=\"color: inherit\">-t</code> stands for the feature type to use, and in our case we’re using “transcript”. Guess what <code style=\"color: inherit\">-o</code> is! Indeed, that’s the output annotation table - here we specify the file path of our transcript to gene map. We will also have another output denoted by <code style=\"color: inherit\">-e</code> and that’s the path to a filtered FASTA. Finally, we also put <code style=\"color: inherit\">-r</code> which is there only to suppress header on output. Summarising, output will be a an annotation table, and a FASTA-format cDNAs file with unannotated transcripts removed.</p>\n<p>Why filtered FASTA?\nSometimes it’s important that there are no transcripts in a FASTA-format transcriptome that cannot be matched to a transcript/gene mapping. Salmon, for example,  used to produce errors when this mismatch was present. We can synchronise the cDNA file by removing mismatches as we have done above.</p>\n<h1 id=\"generate-a-transcriptome-index\">Generate a transcriptome index</h1>\n<p>We will use Salmon in mapping-based mode, so first we have to build a Salmon index for our transcriptome.

While the mapping algorithms will make use of arbitrarily long matches between the query and reference, the k size selected here will act as the minimum acceptable length for a valid match. Thus, a smaller value of k may slightly improve sensitivity. We find that a k of 31 seems to work well for reads of 75bp or longer, but you might consider a smaller k if you plan to deal with shorter reads. Also, a shorter value of k may improve sensitivity even more when using selective alignment (enabled via the –validateMappings flag).

The index is in a binary rather than human-readable format, but allows fast lookup by Alevin. Because the types of biological and technical sequences we need to include in the index can vary between experiments, and because we often want to use the most up-to-date reference sequences from Ensembl or NCBI, we can end up re-making the indices quite often.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1 id=\"use-alevin\">Use Alevin</h1>\n<p>Time to use Alevin now! Alevin works under the same indexing scheme (as Salmon) for the reference, and consumes the set of FASTA/Q files(s) containing the Cellular Barcode(CB) + Unique Molecule identifier (UMI) in one read file and the read sequence in the other. Given just the transcriptome and the raw read files, Alevin generates a cell-by-gene count matrix (in a fraction of the time compared to other tools).</p>\n<blockquote class=\"details\" style=\"border: 2px solid #ddd; margin: 1em 0.2em\">\n<div class=\"box-title details-title\" id=\"details-how-does-alevin-work-in-detail\"><button class=\"gtn-boxify-button details\" type=\"button\" aria-controls=\"details-how-does-alevin-work-in-detail\" aria-expanded=\"true\"><i class=\"fas fa-info-circle\" aria-hidden=\"true\" ></i> <span>Details: How does Alevin work in detail?</span><span class=\"fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square\"></span></button></div>\n<p>Alevin works in two phases. In the first phase it quickly parses the read file containing the CB and UMI information to generate the frequency distribution of all the observed CBs, and creates a lightweight data-structure for fast-look up and correction of the CB. In the second round, Alevin utilizes the read-sequences contained in the files to map the reads to the transcriptome, identify potential PCR/sequencing errors in the UMIs, and performs hybrid de-duplication while accounting for UMI collisions. Finally, a post-abundance estimation CB whitelisting procedure is done and a cell-by-gene count matrix is generated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Alevin can be run using the following command:</p>\n",

However, if you’re not sure what value to pick, you can simply allow Alevin to make its own calls on what constitutes empty droplets.</p>\n<p>This tool will take a while to run. Alevin produces many file outputs, not all of which we’ll use. You can refer to the <a href=\"https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/alevin.html\">Alevin documentation</a> if you’re curious what they all are, you can look through all the different files to find information such as the mapping rate, but we’ll just pass the whole output folder directory for downstream analysis.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"question\" style=\"border: 2px solid #8A9AD0; margin: 1em 0.2em\">\n<div class=\"box-title question-title\" id=\"question-1\"><i class=\"far fa-question-circle\" aria-hidden=\"true\" ></i> Question</div>\n<ol>\n<li>Can you find the information what was the mapping rate?</li>\n<li>How many transcripts did Alevin find?</li>\n</ol>\n<br/><details style=\"border: 2px solid #B8C3EA; margin: 1em 0.2em;padding: 0.5em; cursor: pointer;\"><summary>👁 View solution</summary>\n<div class=\"box-title solution-title\" id=\"solution-1\"><button class=\"gtn-boxify-button solution\" type=\"button\" aria-controls=\"solution-1\" aria-expanded=\"true\"><i class=\"far fa-eye\" aria-hidden=\"true\" ></i> <span>Solution</span><span class=\"fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square\"></span></button></div>\n<ol>\n<li>As mentioned above, in <em>alevin_output</em> folder there will be many different files, including the log files.

For some reason, running Alevin may sometimes cause problems in Jupyter Notebook and this process will stop and not go to completion. This is the reason why we use hugely subsampled dataset here - bigger ones couldn’t be fully analysed (they worked fine locally though). The dataset used in this tutorial shouldn’t make any issues when you’re using Jupyter notebook through galaxy.eu, however might not work properly on galaxy.org. If you’re accessing Jupyter notebook via galaxy.eu and alevin process stopped, just restart the kernel and that should help.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!---\ncheck if we can get alevinQC to work - and paste the info from the first Alevin tutorial?\n-->\n<h1 id=\"alevin-output-to-summarizedexperiment\">Alevin output to SummarizedExperiment</h1>\n<p>Let’s change gear a little bit. We’ve done the work in bash, and now we’re switching to R to complete the processing. To do so, you have to change Kernel to R (either click on <code style=\"color: inherit\">Kernel</code> -&gt; <code style=\"color: inherit\">Change Kernel...</code> in the upper left corner of your
