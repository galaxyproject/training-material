                <p>The goal of this tutorial is to apply bulk RNA deconvolution techniques to a problem with multiple variables - in this case, a model of diabetes is compared with its healthy counterparts. All you need to compare inferred cell compositions are well-annotated, high quality reference scRNA-seq datasets, transformed into MuSiC-friendly Expression Set objects, and your bulk RNA-samples of choice (also transformed into MuSiC-friendly Expression Set objects). For more information on how MuSiC works, you can check out their github site <a href="https://xuranw.github.io/MuSiC/articles/MuSiC.html">MuSiC</a> or published article (<span class="citation"><a href="#wang2019bulk">Wang <i>et al.</i> 2019</a></span>).</p>

<h1 id="data">Data</h1>

<p>In the standard MuSiC tutorial, we used human pancreas data. We will now use the same single cell reference dataset <span class="citation"><a href="#segerstolpe2016single">Segerstolpe <i>et al.</i> 2016</a></span> with its 10 samples of 6 healthy subjects and 4 with Type-II diabetes (T2D), as well as the bulk RNA-samples from the same lab (3 healthy, 4 diseased). Both of these datasets were accessed from the public EMBL-EBI repositories and transformed into Expression Set objects in the previous two tutorials. For both the single cell reference and the bulk samples of interest, you have generated Expression Set objects with only T2D samples, only healthy samples, and a final everything-combined sample for the scRNA reference. We won’t need the combined bulk RNA dataset. The plan is to analyse this data in three ways: using a combined reference (altogether); using only the healthy single cell reference (healthyscref); or using a healthy and combined reference separately (like4like), all to identify differences in cellular composition.</p>

This simplifies the tracking of datasets across the Galaxy interface.

The unique feature of these tags is that they <em>propagate</em>: if a dataset is labelled with a name tag, all derivatives (children) of this dataset will automatically inherit this tag (see below). The figure below explains why this is so useful. Consider the following analysis (numbers in parenthesis correspond to dataset numbers in the figure below):</p>   <ol>   <li>a set of forward and reverse reads (datasets 1 and 2) is mapped against a reference using <span><strong>Bowtie2</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> generating dataset 3;</li>   <li>dataset 3 is used to calculate read coverage using <span><strong>BedTools Genome Coverage</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> <em>separately</em> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> strands.

This is shown on the left side of the figure. It is hard to trace which datasets contain “plus” data versus “minus” data. For example, does dataset 10 contain “plus” data or “minus” data? Probably “minus” but are you sure? In the case of a small history like the one shown here, it is possible to trace this manually but as the size of a history grows it will become very challenging.</p>   <p>The right side of the figure shows exactly the same analysis, but using name tags. When the analysis was conducted datasets 4 and 5 were tagged with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#plus</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#minus</code>, respectively. When they were used as inputs to Macs2 resulting datasets 6 and 8 automatically inherited them and so on… As a result it is straightforward to trace both branches (plus and minus) of this analysis.</p>   <p>More information is in a <a href="/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/name-tags/tutorial.html">dedicated #nametag tutorial</a>.</p>   <!-- Image is here = https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1iiNsau6ddiE2MV9qMyekUq2mrpDHHcc02bXtcFEAnhY/edit?usp=sharing --> </blockquote>

<p>There are four sets of output files.</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Summarised Plots</em> &lt;- This is the most interesting output, because it has the pretty pictures!</li>
  <li><em>Individual Heatmaps</em> &lt;- This kind of does what standard (non-Comparing) MuSiC does for each sample, rather than combining them.</li>
  <li><em>Stats</em> &lt;- This will be very handy if you want to make any statistical calculations, as it contains medians and quartiles</li>
  <li><em>Tables</em> &lt;- This contains the cell proportions found within each sample as well as the number of reads.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="summarised-plots">Summarised Plots</h3>

<p>Examine <i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">galaxy-eye</span> the output file <em>Summarised Plots (MuSiC)</em>. Now the first few pages are similar to the standard deconvolution tool, but now comparing across the factor of interest (disease). Among the myriad of visualisations available, our favourite is on page 5 - a comparison of inferred cell proportions across disease.</p>

<figure id="figure-2" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/bulk-music/plot_altogether.png" alt="Graph showing two rows for each cell type (gamma, ductal, delta, beta, alpha, and acinar cells) comparison normal or T2D proportions by either read or by sample." width="2140" height="1016" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/bulk-music/plot_altogether.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 2</strong>:</span> Altogether: Resulting Graph</figcaption></figure>

<p>Here we can see that the bulk-RNA seq samples from the T2D patients contain markedly fewer beta cells as compared with their healthy counterparts. This makes sense, so that’s good!</p>

<h3 id="individual-heatmaps">Individual Heatmaps</h3>

<p>Examine <i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">galaxy-eye</span> the output file <em>Individual heatmaps (MuSiC)</em>. This shows the cell distribution across each of the individual samples, separated out by disease factor into two separate plots, but ultimately isn’t particularly informative.</p>

<figure id="figure-3" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/bulk-music/individual_heatmaps.png" alt="Heatmap showing vertically four samples (Bulk) and horizontally each cell type (from alpha to ductal), with gradations of colour referring to the proportion of that cell type within each sample." width="1738" height="1758" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/bulk-music/individual_heatmaps.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 3</strong>:</span> Altogether: Individual heatmaps</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="stats">Stats</h3>

<p>If you select the <em>Stats</em> dataset, you’ll find it contains four sets of data, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bulk_disease: Read Props</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bulk_disease: Sample Props</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bulk_healthy: Read Props</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bulk_healthy: Sample Props</code>. Examine <i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">galaxy-eye</span> the file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bulk_disease: Sample Props</code>. This contains summary statistics (Min, quartiles, median, mean, etc.) for each phenotype. This could be quite helpful if you’re trying to statistically identify differences across samples.</p>

<figure id="figure-4" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/bulk-music/summary_statistics.png" alt="Table with rows as cell types and columns as statistics: Min, 1st Qu., Median, Mean." width="1356" height="424" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/bulk-music/summary_statistics.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 4</strong>:</span> Altogether: Stats</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="tables">Tables</h3>

<p>Finally, if you select the <em>Tables</em> dataset, you’ll find it contains three sets of data, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Data Table</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Matrix of Cell Type Read Counts</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Matrix of Cell Type Sample Proportions</code>.</p>

<p>Examine <i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">galaxy-eye</span> the file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Data Table</code>. This contains the inferred proportions and reads associated with each sample and cell type, along with its important factor of interest (Disease). In this tutorial, we tend to use sample proportions rather than read count, but either works. The two other matrix files are just portions of this data table.</p>

      <li>Overall, our interpretation here is that the differences are less pronounced. It’s interesting to conjecture whether this is an artefact of analysis, or whether - possibly - the beta cells in the diseased samples are not only fewer, but also contain fewer beta-cell specific transcripts (and thereby inhibited beta cell function), thereby lowering the bar for the inference of a beta cell and leading to a higher proportion of interred B-cells.</li>

<p>Let’s try one more inference - this time, we’ll use only healthy cells as a reference, to (theoretically) make a more consistent analysis across the two phenotypes.</p>

<p>Overall, it’s important to remember how the inference changes depending on the reference used - for example, a combined reference might have majority healthy samples or diseased samples, so that would impact the inferred cellular compositions.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Congrats! You’ve made it to the end of this suite of deconvolution tutorials! You’ve learned how to find quality data for reference and for analysis, how to reformat it for deconvolution using MuSiC, and how to compare cellular inferences using multiple kinds of reference datasets. You can find the <a href="https://usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/w/music-deconvolution-compare-1">workflow for this tutorial</a> and an <a href="https://usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/h/music-deconvolution-comparisons--final">example history</a>.</p>

<p>We hope this helps you in your research!</p>
