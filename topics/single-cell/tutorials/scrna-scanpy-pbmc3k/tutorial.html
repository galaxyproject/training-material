                <p>Single-cell RNA-seq analysis is a rapidly evolving field at the forefront of transcriptomic research, used in high-throughput developmental studies and rare transcript studies to examine cell heterogeneity within a populations of cells. The cellular resolution and genome wide scope make it possible to draw new conclusions that are not otherwise possible with bulk RNA-seq.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will investigate clustering of single-cell data from 10x Genomics, including preprocessing, clustering and the identification of cell types via known marker genes, using <a href="https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">Scanpy</a> (<span class="citation"><a href="#wolf2018scanpy">Wolf <i>et al.</i> 2018</a></span>).

<h1 id="data">Data</h1>

<p>For this tutorial, we analyze a dataset of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) extracted from a healthy donor, freely available from 10X Genomics. The dataset contains 2,700 single cells sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500. The raw sequences have been processed by the <a href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger"><strong>cellranger</strong></a> pipeline from 10X to extract a unique molecular identifier (UMI) count matrix, in a similar way to that as explained in <a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-preprocessing-tenx/tutorial.html">“Pre-processing of 10X Single-Cell RNA Datasets” tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>In this matrix, the values represent the number for each feature (i.e. gene; row) that are detected in each cell (column). Such matrices can be quite large, where here there are 2,700 columns with 32,738 lines, with mostly zero values, i.e. an extremely sparse matrix. To optimize the storage of such a table and the information about the genes and cells, <strong>cellranger</strong> creates 3 files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">genes.tsv</code>: a tabular file with information about the 32,738 genes in 2 columns (Ensembl gene id and the gene symbol)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">barcodes.tsv</code>: a tabular file with the barcode for each of the 2,700 cells</li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matrix.mtx</code>: a condensed version of the count matrix</p>

    <p>The count matrix is therefore represented by its non-zero values. Each non-zero value is indicated by its line number (1st column), its column number (2nd column) and its value (3rd column). The first row gives indication about the number of lines, column and non-zero values. More information on the Matrix Market Exchange (mtx) format can be found <a href="https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html">in this documentation</a></p>

<p>The representation of the matrix with 3 files is convenient to share the data but not to process them. Single-cell analysis packages have attempted to solve the problem of storage and analysis by inventing their own standard, which has led to the proliferation of many different “standards” in the scRNA-seq package ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="anndata">AnnData</h2>

<p>The most common format, called <a href="https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AnnData</code></a>, stores the matrix as well as gene and cell annotations in a concise, compressed and extremely readable manner:</p>

<figure id="figure-1" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="/training-material/topics/single-cell/images/scrna-pre-processing/tenx_anndata.svg" alt="Anndata format.

<p>This format is used by <a href="https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">Scanpy</a> (<span class="citation"><a href="#wolf2018scanpy">Wolf <i>et al.</i> 2018</a></span>), the tool suite for analyzing single-cell gene expression data that we will use in this tutorial. So we need first to import the matrix and annotations of genes and cells into an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AnnData</code> object.</p>

<p>Because the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AnnData</code> format is an extension of the HDF5 format, i.e. a binary format, an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AnnData</code> object can not be inspected directly in Galaxy by clicking on the <i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">galaxy-eye</span> (<strong>View data</strong>) icon.

<p>Low-quality cells may be due to a variety of sources such as cell damage during dissociation or failure in library preparation (e.g., inefficient reverse transcription or PCR amplification, <span class="citation"><a href="#ilicic2016classification">Ilicic <i>et al.</i> 2016</a></span>). Usually these low-quality cells have low total counts, few expressed genes and high mitochondrial or spike-in proportions. Low-quality cells are problematic for downstream analyses and may contribute to misleading results.</p>

<blockquote class="details">
  <div class="box-title details-title" id="details-impact-of-low-quality-cells-on-the-downstream-analyses"><button class="gtn-boxify-button details" type="button" aria-controls="details-impact-of-low-quality-cells-on-the-downstream-analyses" aria-expanded="true"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Details: Impact of low-quality cells on the downstream analyses</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <h4 id="formation-of-their-own-distinct-clusters">Formation of their own distinct cluster(s)</h4>

  <p>Increased mitochondrial proportions or enrichment for nuclear RNAs after cell damage are the most obvious causes for this phenomenon. Low-quality cells in different cell types can, in the worst case, cluster together (because of similarities in the damage-induced expression profiles) leading to artificial intermediate states or trajectories between subpopulations that should be otherwise distinct. This phenomenon makes the results difficult to interpret.</p>

  <h4 id="distortion-of-population-heterogeneity-during-variance-estimation-or-principal-components-analysis">Distortion of population heterogeneity during variance estimation or principal components analysis</h4>

  <p>With low-quality cells, the main differences captured by the first few principal components will be based on quality rather than biology, reducing then the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction. Similarly, differences between low- and high-quality cells will create genes with the largest variances. For example, in low-quality cells with very low counts, the scaling normalization increases the variance of genes that happen to have a non-zero count in those cells.</p>

  <h4 id="misidentification-of-upregulated-genes">Misidentification of upregulated genes</h4>

  <p>Due to aggressive scaling to normalize for small cell sizes, low-quality cells shows genes that appear to be strongly “upregulated”. For example, contaminating transcripts may be present in all cells with a low but constant levels. With the increased scaling normalization in low-quality cells, the small counts for these transcripts may become large normalized expression values, i.e. an apparent upregulation compared to other cells.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>To mitigate these problems, we need to remove these low-quality cells at the start of the analysis. Several common QC metrics can be used to identify these cells based on their expression profile:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cell size</strong>, i.e. the total sum of counts across all genes for each cells</p>

    <p>When cells are very degraded or absent from the library preparation, the number of reads sequenced from that library will be very low. Cells with small sizes are then considered to be of low quality: the RNA has been lost during the library preparation (cell lysis, inefficient cDNA capture and amplification, etc.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Number of expressed genes</strong>, i.e. the number of genes with non-zero counts for each cells</p>

    <p>A low number of expressed genes may be a result of poor-quality cells (e.g. dying, degraded, damaged, etc.), followed by high PCR amplification of the remaining RNA. The diverse transcript population has not been successfully captured so the cell is considered of low quality. Cell doublets or multiplets may also exhibit an aberrantly high gene count.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Proportion of reads mapped to genes in the mitochondrial genome</strong></p>

    <p>High concentrations of mitochondrial genes is often a result of damaged cells (<span class="citation"><a href="#islam2014quantitative">Islam <i>et al.</i> 2014</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#ilicic2016classification">Ilicic <i>et al.</i> 2016</a></span>) where the endogenous RNA escapes or degrades. As mitochondria has its own cell membranes, it is often the last DNA/RNA in damaged cells to degrade and hence occurs in high quantities during sequencing.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We will make the key assumption that these metrics are independent of the biological state of each cell. Technical factors rather than biological processes are presumed to drive poor values (e.g., low cell sizes, high mitochondrial proportions). The subsequent removal of impacted cells do not misrepresent the biology in downstream analyses.</p>

<p>To identify low-quality cells, the simplest approach is to apply thresholds on the QC metrics. This strategy, while simple, is required to determine appropriate thresholds that will change given the experimental protocol and the biological system.</p>

<h3 id="computation-of-qc-metrics">Computation of QC metrics</h3>

<p>To estimate the thresholds, we first need to look at the distribution of QC metrics for our dataset.</p>

<p>The first 2 QC metrics (cell size and number of expressed genes) can be easily estimated from the count table. For the third metric (proportion of reads mapped to genes in the mitochondrial genome), we need the information about which genes are mitochondrial or not.</p>

<h3 id="filtering-of-low-quality-cells">Filtering of low-quality cells</h3>

<p>As explained before, we would like now to filter for low-quality cells based on the 3 previous metrics (cell size, number of expressed genes, and proportion of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes). As the cell size is highly correlated with the number expressed genes, we can focus only on the number expressed genes and the proportion of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes.</p>

<p>Based on the previous plot, we would like to remove cells that have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a number of expressed genes below 200 or above 2,500</li>
  <li>a percentage of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes above 5%</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="normalization-and-scaling">Normalization and scaling</h2>

<p>In scRNA-seq, we can observe systematic differences in sequencing coverage between cells (<span class="citation"><a href="#stegle2015computational">Stegle <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>), because of technical differences in cDNA capture or PCR amplification efficiency across cells, attributable to the difficulty of achieving consistent library preparation with minimal starting material. After removing low-quality cells, normalization of the counts removes these differences to avoid that they interfere with comparisons of the expression profiles between cells. Any observed heterogeneity or differential expression within the cell population after normalization are then driven by biology and not technical biases.</p>

<p>Scaling normalization is the simplest and most commonly-used class of normalization strategies. All counts for each cell are divided by a cell-specific scaling factor, often called a “size factor”. The assumption behind this process is that any technical biases tend to affect genes in a similar manner. The relative bias for each cell is represented by the size factor for that cell. Dividing the cell counts by its size factor should then remove the bias.</p>

<p>The simplest strategy for scaling normalization is the cell size normalization, i.e. similar total sum of counts across all genes for each cell. The “cell size factor” for each cell is computed directly for its cell size and transformed such that the mean size factor across all cells is equal to 1. The normalized expression values are then kept on the same scale as the original counts.</p>

<p>Here we would to normalize our count table such that each cell have 10,000 reads.</p>

<p>The normalized counts should be log-transformed afterwards to adjust for the mean-variance relationship.</p>

<p>With log-transformation, the differences in the log-values represent log-fold changes in expression. Log-transformation focuses on promoting contributions from genes with strong relative differences (e.g. a gene that is expressed at an average count of 50 in cell type A and 10 in cell type B rather than a gene that is expressed at an average count of 1100 in A and 1000 in B).</p>

<h2 id="selection-of-features">Selection of features</h2>

<p>Data from scRNA-Seq is often used in exploratory analyses to characterize heterogeneity across cells. With clustering and dimensionality reduction, cells are compared based on their gene expression profiles. The choice of genes to use may have a major impact on the behaviour of the clustering and the dimensionality reduction. We need then to remove genes with random noise while keeping genes containing useful information about the biology of the system. This reduces the data size but still highlights any interesting biological signal without the noise that obscures that structure.</p>

<p>Selecting the most variable genes based on their expression across the cells (i.e. genes highly expressed in some cells, and lowly expressed in others) is the simplest approach for feature selection. With this approach, we assume that increased variation in some genes compared to other genes are genuine biological differences and not technical noise or a baseline level of “uninteresting” biological variation.</p>

<p>To quantify the per-gene variation, the simplest approach consists of computing the variance of the log-normalized expression values for each gene across all cells in the population. With this approach, the feature selection is based on the same log-values as the ones used in clustering, ensuring then that the quantitative definition of heterogeneity is consistent throughout the entire analysis.</p>

<p>Calculation of the per-gene variance is simple but feature selection requires modelling of the mean-variance relationship, as done in the Seurat procedure (<span class="citation"><a href="#stuart2019comprehensive">Stuart <i>et al.</i> 2019</a></span>) we will use.</p>

<p>Once the per-gene variation has been quantified, we need to select the subset of highly variable genes that we will use in downstream analyses. A large subset reduces the risk of discarding any interesting biological signal, but increases the noise from irrelevant genes on the signal. The optimal trade-off is difficult to determine but there are several common strategies routinely used. You can read the <a href="https://osca.bioconductor.org/feature-selection.html#hvg-selection">Chapter 8 from “Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor”</a> for a nice presentation of the different strategies. Here, we will define the set of highly variable genes as those which, after normalization, have a normalized dispersion amount higher than 0.5.</p>

<h1 id="dimensionality-reduction">Dimensionality reduction</h1>

<p>We aim in scRNA-seq to compare cells based on their expressions across genes, e.g. to identify similar transcriptomic profiles. Each gene represents then a dimension of the data.</p>

<p>With a dataset of 2 genes, we could make a 2-dimensional plot where each point is a cell and each axis is the expression of one gene. For datasets with thousands of genes, the concept is the same: each cell’s expression profile defines its location in the high-dimensional expression space.</p>

<p>Expressions of different genes are correlated if they are affected by the same biological process. The separate information for these individual genes do not need to be stored, but can instead be compressed into a single dimension, e.g. an “eigengene”. Dimensionality reduction aims then to reduce the number of separate dimensions in the data and then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduces the computational work in downstream analyses to only a few dimensions</li>
  <li>reduces noise by averaging across multiple genes to obtain a more precise representation of the patterns in the data</li>
  <li>enables effective plotting of the data.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="principal-component-analysis">Principal Component Analysis</h2>

<p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique consisting in the identification of axes in high-dimensional space that capture the largest amount of variation. This simple, highly effective strategy is widely used in data science.</p>

<p>In PCA, the first axis (or Principal Component (PC)) is chosen such that it captures the greatest variance across cells. The next PC should be orthogonal to the first and capture the greatest remaining amount of variation, and so on.</p>

<p>By applying PCA to scRNA-Seq, we assume that multiple genes are affected by the same biological processes in a coordinated way and random technical or biological noise affects each gene independently. As more variation can be captured by considering the correlated behaviour of many genes, the top PCs are likely to represent the biological signal and the noise are concentrated into the later PCs. The dominant factors of heterogeneity are then captured by the top PCs. Restricting downstream analyses to the top PCs will then reduce the dimensionality of the data whilst focusing on the biological signal and removing the noise.</p>

<p>Here we perform the PCA on the log-normalized expression values and compute the first 50 PCs.</p>

<p>On these plots we see the different cells projected onto the first 3 PCs. We can already see subpopulations of cells, but only 3 PCs are represented there and plot like these are not so informative. It may be more interesting to project also the values for the genes, since perhaps these are the genes most involved in the 3 PCs.</p>

<h2 id="determination-of-the-number-of-pcs-to-keep">Determination of the number of PCs to keep</h2>

<p>We performed the PCA analyses using 50 PCS. They represent a robust compression of the dataset, but we may not need to keep all of them. How many components should we choose to include?</p>

<p>The choice of the number of PCs is a similar question to the choice of the number of highly variable genes to keep. More PCs means more noise but also more biological signal.</p>

<p>A simple heuristic for choosing the number of PCs generates an “Elbow plot”: a ranking of the PCs based on the percentage of variance they explain.</p>

<p>We encourage users to repeat downstream analyses with different number of PCs.</p>

<h1 id="clustering-of-the-cells">Clustering of the cells</h1>

<p>In the PC projection, we saw some subpopulations of cells emerging. We would like now to empirically define these subpopulation of cells with similar expression profiles using unsupervised clustering.</p>

<p>Clustering summarizes the data and allows us to describe the population heterogeneity in terms of discrete and easily understandable labels. The subpopulations can be afterwards treated as proxies for biological objects like cell types or states.</p>

<p>Graph-based clustering has been popularized for clustering large scRNA-Seq datasets by its use in Seurat (<span class="citation"><a href="#butler2018integrating">Butler <i>et al.</i> 2018</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#stuart2019comprehensive">Stuart <i>et al.</i> 2019</a></span>). Such approaches like the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph works in 2 steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Computation of a neighborhood graph</strong></p>

    <p>A graph is first built with each node being a cell connected to its nearest neighbours having similar expression patterns. Edges are weighted based on the similarity between the cells: higher weight is given to cells that are more closely related, i.e. have similar expression profiles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Clustering of the neighborhood graph</strong></p>

    <p>The graph is then partitioned into highly interconnected “quasi-cliques” or “communities”, i.e. cells that are more connected to cells in the same community than they are to cells of different communities. Each community represents a cluster that we can use for downstream interpretation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="computation-of-a-neighborhood-graph">Computation of a neighborhood graph</h2>

<p>When running graph-based clustering, we need to think about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How many neighbors are considered when constructing the graph.</li>
  <li>What scheme is used to weight the edges.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, to reproduce original results, we choose 10 neighbors for a KNN graph, the Euclidian distance metrics and the UMAP method (<span class="citation"><a href="#mcinnes2018umap">McInnes <i>et al.</i> 2018</a></span>) to compute the connectivities. The values will change depending on the data and can not easily predefined: testing different values is the only solution.</p>

<h2 id="visualization-of-the-neighborhood-graph">Visualization of the neighborhood graph</h2>

<p>To visualize and explore the neighborhood graph, we can apply an extra step of non-linear dimensional reduction techniques to learn the underlying manifold of the data in order to place similar cells together in low-dimensional space. Cells that will be in the same clusters, i.e. cells with similar local neighborhoods in high-dimensional space, should co-localize on these low-dimensional plots.</p>

<p>Two techniques are commonly used for the non-linear dimensional reduction: <em>t</em>-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) and UMAP. Scanpy authors recommend to use here UMAP as it better preserves trajectories (check <span class="citation"><a href="#becht2019dimensionality">Becht <i>et al.</i> 2019</a></span> for a review) and easily accommodates new data.</p>

<p>Here, we will reduce the neighborhood to 2 UMAP components and then we will check to see how the cells are projected on them given the top genes</p>

    <p>With the plot colored with NKG7 expression, we clearly see that the blob on the bottom right could be divided in 3 sub-clusters (light green, blue, purple). Given the expression of PPBP, the “arm” on the blob on the left should be a different cluster.</p>

<h2 id="clustering-of-the-neighborhood-graph">Clustering of the neighborhood graph</h2>

<p>Given the first visualization, we can now cluster the cells within a neighborhood graph.</p>

<p>Which community detection algorithm should we use to define the clusters? Several modularity optimization techniques such as the SLM (<span class="citation"><a href="#blondel2008fast">Blondel <i>et al.</i> 2008</a></span>), Louvain algorithm (<span class="citation"><a href="#levine2015data">Levine <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>) or the Leiden algorithm (<span class="citation"><a href="#traag2019louvain">Traag <i>et al.</i> 2019</a></span>) are available to iteratively group cells together while optimizing the standard modularity function.</p>

<p>Currently, the Louvain graph-clustering method (community detection based on optimizing modularity) is the one recommended. We need to define a value for the resolution parameter, i.e. the ‘granularity’ of the downstream clustering. High values lead to a greater number of clusters. For single-cell datasets of around 3K cells, we recommend to use a value between 0.4 and 1.2. For larger datasets, the optimal resolution will be higher.</p>

<h1 id="finding-marker-genes">Finding marker genes</h1>

<p>To give sense to the clusters, we need to identify the genes that drive separation between clusters. These marker genes can then be used to assign biological sense (e.g. cell type) to each cluster based on their functional annotation, but also to identify subtle differences between clusters (e.g., changes in activation or differentiation state) based on the behaviour of genes in the affected pathways.</p>

<p>Marker genes are usually detected by their differential expression between clusters, as the more strongly DE genes are more likely to have caused separate clustering of cells. To quantify the differences in expression profiles, several different statistical tests can be used.</p>

<p>The identification of the marker genes for each cluster is made not only on the highly variable genes, but on the whole set (currently stored in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">raw</code> attribute).</p>

<h2 id="using-the-t-test">Using the <em>t</em>-test</h2>

<p>The simplest and fastest method is the Welch <em>t</em>-test. It has good statistical properties for large numbers of cells (<span class="citation"><a href="#soneson2018bias">Soneson and Robinson 2018</a></span>).</p>

    <p>In this graph are the marker genes distinguishing cluster 0 from cluster 1, ranked based on their difference of expression of the genes between cells in both clusters. So MALAT1 is the most differentially expressed gene between cells in cluster 0 and cells in cluster 1, even though it was not in the set of  top marker genes for cluster 0.</p>

<p>The marker genes distinguishing cluster 0 from cluster 1 are extracted based on their differences in expression, which can be easily visualized.</p>

<p>Previous visualizations like the heatmap can also be used to represent the differential expression of the marker genes between both clusters.</p>

<p>In the next steps, we are mostly interested in the marker genes for each cluster individually by comparison one cluster to the rest, instead of a 1-to-1 comparison. So we will use again the AnnData object called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3k PBMC with only HVG, after scaling, PCA, KNN graph, UMAP, clustering, marker genes with Wilcoxon test</code>.</p>

<h1 id="cell-type-annotation">Cell type annotation</h1>

<p>Obtaining clusters of cells is quite straightforward. Determining what biological state is represented by each of those clusters is likely the most challenging task in scRNA-Seq data analysis. To do so, we need to bridge the gap between our current dataset and prior biological knowledge.</p>

<p>This biological knowledge is not always available in a consistent and quantitative manner. For example, the concept of “cell type” is not clearly defined. The interpretation of scRNA-seq data is often then quite manual.</p>

<p>Fortunately in the case of our dataset, we can use canonical markers to known cell types:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Some canonical marker genes like LYZ or CST3 are not only highly expressed in their cell type but also on closely related other cell types.</li>
      <li>As seen on the UMAP graph, T cells (CD4+ and CD8+) are clustered together with NK cells, but NK cells and CD8+ closer to each other. Monocytes cells (CD14+ and FCGR3A+) are close to each others, but B cells are close to Dendritic and then Megakaryocytes despite B cells being physically independent on the neighborhood graph.</li>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><i class="far fa-thumbs-up" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">congratulations</span> Well done, you’ve made it to the end! In this tutorial, we investigated clustering and annotation of single-cell data from 10x Genomics using Scanpy. This workflow used here was typical for scRNA-seq data analysis:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Preprocessing with
    <ol>
      <li>Selection and filtration of cells and genes based on quality metrics</li>
      <li>Data normalization and scaling</li>
      <li>Selection of features, i.e. marker genes</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Reduction of the dimensionality via a Principal Component Analysis</li>
  <li>Clustering of the cells by
    <ol>
      <li>Computation of a neighborhood graph</li>
      <li>Clustering of the neighborhood graph into 8 clusters of cells</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Identification of marker genes for the clusters</li>
  <li>Annotation of the clusters with cell types</li>
</ol>
