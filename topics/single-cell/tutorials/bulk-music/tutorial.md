# Introduction


<!-- using info from here: https://xuranw.github.io/MuSiC/articles/MuSiC.html -->

Bulk RNA-seq data contains a mixture of transcript signatures from several types of cells. We wish to deconvolve this mixture to obtain estimates of the proportions of cell types within the bulk sample. To do this, we can use single cell RNA-seq data as a reference for estimating the cell type proportions within the bulk data.

In this tutorial, we will use bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data, including matrices of similar tissues from different sources, to illustrate how to infer cell type abundances from bulk RNA-seq.

## Bulk RNA-seq Cell Type Deconvolution

The heterogeneity that exists in the cellular composition of bulk RNA-seq can add bias to the results from differential expression analysis. In order to circumvent this limitation, RNA-seq deconvolution aims to infer cell type abundances by modelling the gene expressions levels as 'weighted sums' of cell type specific expression profiles.

> <details-title>More details on 'Sums'</details-title>
>
> **So...** You fancy some maths do you? Good! This is important, as you'll see variations of the phrase 'weighted sums' if you ever look at any papers in the field! Let's think about just the 'sums' here.
> If we think about the total expression of a given gene you might get from bulk RNA-seq, you could also think about it as the sum of the expression of each cell, for example,

> *Total = cell<sub>a</sub> expression + cell<sub>b</sub> expression ... (and so forth)*
>
> This is a *'sum'*, because we're adding up all the cells. If we now think about how we expect similar expression from similar cell types, we could change this to the following:
>
> *Total = cell_type<sub>a</sub> expression + cell_type<sub>b</sub> expression*  ... (and so forth)
>
> **BUT WAIT!** That's not strictly true, because the cell types are not all in equal proportion (if only!). So we have to take into account another variable, the proportion a given cell type takes up in a sample. So we now have:
>
> *Total = Proportion<sub>a</sub> x cell_type<sub>a</sub> expression + Proportion<sub>b</sub> x cell_type<sub>b</sub> expression*
>
> So now, we are using the sums of expression based off of the cell proportion. And if you're a mathematician, you might instead put this as

>
> The point is, if we have an idea of what the average expression should be for each gene (what we can get from single cell RNA-seq data, *C*), and we have the total expression (from the bulk RNA-seq, *C*), then we can infer the cell proportions (*P*).

{: .details}

Many different computational methods have been developed to estimate these cell type proportions, but in this tutorial we will be using the [MuSiC](https://xuranw.github.io/MuSiC/articles/MuSiC.html) tool suite {% cite wang2019bulk %} to estimate the proportion of individual cell types in our bulk RNA-seq datasets.

### MusiC

MuSiC uses cell-type specific gene expression from single-cell RNA seq data to characterize cell type compositions (proportions) from bulk RNA-seq data in complex tissues. By appropriate weighting of genes showing cross-subject (sample to sample) and cross-cell (cells of the same cell type within a sample) consistency, MuSiC enables the transfer of cell type-specific gene expression information from one dataset to another.

>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> >
> > 1. So you know what the *Sum* is from above - the total expression of a given gene in a bulk RNA-seq sample depends on the proportion of cell types and the average expression level of each of those cell types (**T = C x P**). However, single cell RNA-seq data is highly variable. Cell-type specific expression in genes with lower variation from sample to sample (i.e. person to person or organism to organism) and cell to cell (i.e. within a sample) will be the most useful for distinguishing cells, while genes that vary heavily (i.e. high in cell type<sub>a</sub> in one sample, but low in cell type<sub>a</sub> in another sample) will be the least useful in accurately distinguishing cells. Therefore, to accurately use the mean expression level in a cell_type, MusiC weights the sums, favouring more consistently expressed genes in cell types.

{: .question}

Solid tissues often contain closely related cell types that are difficult to distinguish from one another, a phenomenon known as *"collinearity"*. To deal with collinearity, MuSiC can also employ a tree-guided procedure that recursively zooms in on closely related cell types. Briefly, MuSic first groups similar cell types into the same cluster and estimates cluster proportions, then recursively repeats this procedure within each cluster.

# Cell Proportion Estimation

Here we will extract cell proportions from a bulk data of human pancreas data from {%cite fadista2014global %} concerning 56 638 genes across 89 samples, using a single cell human pancreas dataset from {%cite segerstolpe2016single %} containing 25 453 genes across 2209 cells, clustered into 14 cell types, from 6 healthy subjects and 4 with Type-II diabetes (T2D). If the deconvolution is good, and the datasets are compatible with sufficient enough overlap, we should be able to identify the same cell types from the bulk data.

### Exploring the Datasets

  We are told before we download the data, that:
  * The bulk human pancreas dataset is 89 samples across 56 638 genes
  * The single cell human pancreas datasets is 2209 cells across 24 453 genes.

  But what does this actually look like in the data?

   The bulk RNA-seq phenotype file lists the main factors of interest, and HbA1c appears to be a specific gene assosciated with a phenotype. It is well known that the beta cell proportions are related to T2D disease status. In the progress of T2D, the number of beta cells decreases. One of the most important tests for T2D is the HbA1c (hemoglobin A1c) test. When the HbA1c level is greater than 6.5%, the patient is diagnosed as T2D. We will look later at the beta cell proportions relationship with HbA1c level in this deconvolution analysis.

## Building the Expression Set objects

For now we need to construct our Expression set objects that will be consumed by MuSiC.

## Estimating Cell Type proportions

<!-- Maybe this goes in a comment? -->
Instead of selecting marker genes, MuSiC gives weights to each gene. The weighting scheme is based on cross-subject variation, by up-weighing genes with low variation and down-weighing genes with high variation in a cell type. Here we demonstrate this step-by-step with the human pancreas datasets.

The deconvolution of 89 subjects from {%cite fadista2014global %} is performed with the bulk data GSE50244 expression set and single cell reference EMTAB. The estimation was constrained on 6 major cell types: alpha, beta, delta, gamma, acinar and ductal, which make up over 90% of the whole islet.

### Cell Type estimation with **MuSiC**

The deconvolution process can be performed by simply inputting the bulk RNA-seq & scRNA-seq datasets and then hitting execute. However, in this section we will be tracing the effect of a disease phenotype across both datasets.

Here we will use one of the factors from the bulk RNA-seq phenotypes related to the the T2D disease status. Any bulk RNA-seq sample coming from a patient with the `HbA1c` factor above 6.5% would be clinically classified as having T2D, so we want to compare these datasets with non-diseased samples. As diabetes affects Beta cells, we're particularly interested in these cells proportions - mostly to prove that the deconvolution has worked well!

It's also important that input scRNA-seq datasets (ideally) have some representation of cell populations from diseased patients.

Without both healthy & diseased datasets, the cells in the bulk datasets might not be fully identifiable.

The estimated proportions are normalized such that the proportions of cell types within each sample sum to 1. MuSic compares itself against a previous method of deconvolution known as Non-negative Least-Squares (NNLS), which MuSic supercededs via its Weighted Non-negative Least-Squares (W-NNLS) methodology. You can remove this if you wish from within the tool parameters when running.

![jitter_plot](../../images/bulk-music/jitter_plot.png "Jitter plot of Estimated Proportions")

In the above image you can see (a) the estimated proportion of cells for each of the 6 declared types, as calculated by MuSiC and the NNLS methods, respectively. In the (b) section, this information is better represented as a box plot to show you the distribution of cell type proportions.

![ctprop](../../images/bulk-music/ctprop_plot.png "(top) Cell type proportions by disease factor, and (bottom) HbA1c factor expression against beta cell type proportion")

As stated previously, it is well known that the beta cell proportions are related to T2D disease status. As T2D progresses, the number of beta cells decreases. In the above image we can see in (a) that we have the same information as previous, but we also distinguish between cells that from patients with T2D status over the Normal cell phenotypes. Section (b) further explores this with a linear regression showing the cell type proportion of cells with HbA1c expression, where we see that there is a significant negative correlation between HbA1c level and beta cell proportions.

### Proportions of Cell Type to each Bulk RNA sample

One question we might wish to ask is: what affinity did each of the 6 single cell types have to each of the 89 subjects in the bulk data? For this we can look at the raw data {% icon galaxy-eye %} `MuSiC Estimated Proportions of Cell Types` in the `Proportion Matrices`, to get a glimpse of cell type compositions on a bulk RNA sample level.

Both the MuSiC and the NNLS calculations of this data is best represented in the below heatmap, with RNA samples as rows and cell types as columns:

# Estimation of cell type proportions with pre-grouping of cell types

  In the previous section we estimated cell types under the assumption that that the gene expression between cell types was largely independent. However, solid tissues often contain closely related cell types. This correlation of gene expression between these cell types is termed 'collinearity', which makes it difficult to resolve their relative proportions in bulk data.

  To deal with collinearity, MuSiC can also employ a tree-guided procedure that recursively zooms in on closely related cell types.

  Briefly, similar cell types are grouped into the same cluster and their cluster proportions are estimated, then this procedure is recursively repeated within each cluster. At each recursion stage, only genes that have low within-cluster variance are used, as they should be consistent within a cell type. This is critical as the mean expression estimates of genes with high variance are affected by the pervasive bias in cell capture of scRNA-seq experiments, and thus cannot serve as reliable reference.

  To perform this analysis, we will use mouse kidney single-cell RNA-seq data from {% cite park2018single %} described by 16 273 genes over a trimmed subset of 10 000 cells, giving 16 unique cell type (2 of which are novel) across 7 subjects. The bulk RNA-seq dataset is from {% cite beckerman2017transgenic %} and contains mouse kidney tissue described by 19 033 genes over 10 samples.

### Colinearity Dendrogram with **MuSiC** to determine cell type similarities

 Determining cell type similarities requires first producing a design matrix as well as a cross-subject mean of relative abundance, using a tree-based clustering method of the cell types we wish to cluster.

### Heatmap of Cell Type Similarities using **MuSiC**

We shall use the 4 cell type groups determined by the cut off threshold in the above question box. To guide the clustering, we shall upload known epithelial and immune cell markers to improve the more diverse collection of cell types in the C3 and C3 groups.

# Conclusion


In this tutorial we constructed ExpressionSet objects, inspected and annotated them, and then finally processed them with the MuSiC RNA-Deconvolution analysis suite.

Below is an overview of the workflow that was used throughout this tutorial.

![workflow1](../../images/bulk-music/workflow1.png "Workflow for estimating cell types")

Note how two ExpressionSet objects are constructed: one from bulk RNA-seq tabular assay data, and the other from single-cell RNA-seq tabular assay data. A blind analysis of cell proportion estimation is performed first. Then in the second half of the tutorial, we performed a guided analysis using pre-grouped cell types.
