subtopic: exploratory

questions:
- What is Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, and why should I perform it on my marker genes?
- How can I use GO enrichment analysis to better understand the biological functions of the genes in my clusters?

In the tutorial [Filter, plot and explore single-cell RNA-seq data with Scanpy]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_basic-pipeline/tutorial.md %}), we took an important step in our single-cell RNA sequencing analysis by identifying marker genes for each of the clusters in our dataset. These marker genes are crucial, as they help us distinguish between different cell types and states, giving us a clearer picture of the cellular diversity within our samples.
However, simply identifying marker genes is just the beginning. To truly understand what makes each cluster unique, we need to dive deeper into the biological functions these genes are involved in. This is where Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis comes into play.
We will perform GO enrichment analysis as a type of over-representation analysis (ORA), ORA is a statistical method that determines whether genes from pre-defined sets (e.g. genes belonging to a specific GO term) are expressed more than would be expected in a subset of your data. The most commonly used statistical tests are Fischer's exact test and hypergeometric test, more details about them are explained in the tutorial slides.

# Data description

In this tutorial will use the following datasets:

## [A] Marker Genes:

We'll start with two input datasets of marker genes (Study sets):
  * **Marker genes per cell cluster:** This dataset lists the genes that are differentially enriched different in each cell cluster.
  * **Marker genes per condition (wt and ko):** This dataset lists the genes that are differentially enriched between the wild-type (wt) and knockout (ko) conditions.

*Note:* Marker genes were obtained using Scanpy FindMarkers tool. The top 50 marker genes were included in the downstream GO enrichment analysis. More genes can be included in the analysis depending on the requirements. Scanpy FindMarkers tool selects the marker genes based on their log2 fold change and p-values. Focusing on the top-ranked genes helps to filter out less relevant genes, thereby addressing the concern of high false positives that can arise from traditional methods. 

## [B] GO Enrichment Files:

We'll also use three additional files for GO enrichment analysis. 
  * **Gene Ontology file:** This file contains information about Gene Ontology terms.
  * **GO Annotations file:** This file maps genes to their corresponding GO terms.
  * **Population set file:** This file provides a list of all genes involved in the experiment and is used as a background gene set for the analysis.

*Note:* There are several online databases available for downloading GO and GO Annotations files, including the Gene Ontology website, Ensembl, and the UCSC Genome Browser.
  
>  <comment-title>Concept behind GO Enrichment Analysis</comment-title>
>
>  The goal of GO enrichment analysis is to interpret the biological significance of long lists of **marker genes**. By summarizing these genes into a shorter list of enriched **GO terms**. The analysis works by comparing each GO term between your list of marker genes and a **background gene set**. Statistical tests are then used to calculate a p-value that indicates whether a particular GO term is significantly enriched in the marker gene list compared to the background.

# Data processing

To perform GO enrichment analysis on each cell cluster individually, we need to separate our "Markers_clusters Dataset" into seven files, one for each cluster and the "Markers_genotype Dataset" into 2 files, one for each condition. We'll use the "Split file" tool for this step. 

> <hands-on-title>File splitting</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [Split file](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/split_file_on_column/tp_split_on_column/0.4) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"File to select"*: `Markers_cluster` (Input dataset)
>    - *"on column"*: `c1`
>    - *"Include the header in all split files?"*: `Yes`
>
>
>    > <comment-title> Input Dataset </comment-title>
>    >
>    > As we have two datasets, one with the marker genes for all the seven clusters and one with the marker genes for the knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) conditions. Make sure to repeat the analysis twice for the two different datasets. Alternatively, you can run this [workflow](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/mennagamal/w/unnamed-workflow) for parallel analysis of the datasets, under Marker genes choose the second icon to select multiple datasets as shown in the below image.

Next, we need to isolate the Ensembl gene IDs column from each file. We'll use the "Cut Columns" tool to achieve this.

> <hands-on-title> Extract Ensembl IDs </hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [Cut](Cut1) %} with the following parameters:
>    - *"Cut columns"*: `c4`
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"From"*: `split_output` (output of **Split file** {% icon tool %})
>
>
>    > <comment-title> The gene format to use </comment-title>
>    >
>    > In this example we extract column 4 because it contains the Ensembl gene IDs on which the subsequent steps are ideally working. While there are other gene formats like gene symbols, Entrez gene IDs, and more, make sure to check the specific format accepted by the tool you are using. There are also tools available to convert between different gene formats if needed.

# GO Analysis using **GOEnrichment** tool

Now we will perform the GO Enrichment analysis on the list of ensembl gene IDs.

> 1. {% tool [GOEnrichment](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/goenrichment/goenrichment/2.0.1) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Gene Ontology File"*: `GO` (Input dataset)
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Gene Product Annotation File"*: `GO annotations Mus musculus` (Input dataset)
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Study Set File"*: `out_file1` (output of **Cut** {% icon tool %})
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Population Set File (Optional)"*: `Background gene set` (Input dataset)
>
>
>    > <comment-title> Population Set File Selection for GO Enrichment </comment-title>
>    >
>    > When choosing a background for GO enrichment analysis (Population Set File), it's important to consider the context of your data. While using a broad background (like all genes in the organism) is common, it might be more informative to limit the background to genes expressed in the specific tissue or cell type being profiled. In this tutorial we used only genes involved in the experiment before selecting the marker genes.

> 2. Can we perform manual annotation of cluster 7 based on GO enrichment results?
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> >
> > 1. Cluster 7 is enriched for terms like "regulation of cell death", "T cell-mediated cytotoxicity", and "peptidase activator activity involved in the apoptotic process".
> > 2. By looking at the most enriched functions and using our biological knowledge, we can figure out the cell types for many clusters. For example, since the data comes from thymus tissue, we already have an idea of the cell types we might find. The enriched terms in cluster 7 confirm that the cell type is macrophages, which support thymocyte maturation by cleaning up dead cells and debris.

# GO Analysis using **gProfiler GOSt** tool

The gProfiler GOSt (Gene Ontology Sequential Testing) is another popular tool used to perform gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. In addition to providing enrichment results for the standard GO categories of Biological Process (BP), Cellular Component (CC), and Molecular Function (MF), the tool also analyzes enrichment across several other functional annotation databases, including KEGG Pathways, Reactome Pathways, WikiPathways and TF Targets. It also gives a plot to better visualize the results.

>    > The species you select should match the species your genes come from. If you choose the wrong species, the tool might use incorrect information, leading to inaccurate results. For example, human genes behave differently from mouse genes, so selecting the correct species ensures the analysis is relevant to your data.
