questions:
- How can I prepare input files for Monocle starting from an AnnData object?
- How can I infer lineage relationships between clusters, without a time series?
- What can trajectory analysis tell us?
objectives:
- Identify which operations to perform on an AnnData object to obtain the files needed for Monocle
- Follow the Monocle3 workflow and choose the right parameter values
- Compare the outputs from Scanpy and Monocle
- Interpet trajectory analysis results

time_estimation: 2H

key_points:
- You should understand your data object sufficiently to be able to extract relevant information for further analysis.
- Trajectory analysis is highly dependent on the parameter values you choose, as such ‘inferred relationships’ are a bigger mathematical leap. Therefore, you should always check if the output makes biological sense before proceeding to the next step.
- Comparing the output of two different methods applied on the same dataset might be useful to confirm the results, to ensure that the findings are reliable and even sometimes to find a new piece of information.

This tutorial is a follow-up to the ['Single-cell RNA-seq: Case Study']({% link topics/single-cell/index.md %}). We will use the same sample from the previous tutorials. If you haven’t done them yet, it’s highly recommended that you go through them to get an idea how to [prepare a single cell matrix]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_alevin/tutorial.md %}), [combine datasets]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_alevin-combine-datasets/tutorial.md %}) and [filter, plot and process scRNA-seq data]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_basic-pipeline/tutorial.md %}) to get the data in the form we’ll be working on today.

In this tutorial we will perform trajectory analysis using [monocle3](https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle3/). You can find out more about the theory behind trajectory analysis in our [slide deck]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-trajectories/slides.html %}). We have already analysed the trajectory of our sample using the ScanPy toolkit in another tutorial: [Inferring Trajectories using Scanpy]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_JUPYTER-trajectories/tutorial.md %}). However, trajectory analysis is quite sensitive and some methods work better for specific datasets. In this tutorial, you will perform the same steps but using a different method for inferring trajectories. You will then compare the results, usability and outcomes! Sounds exciting, let’s dive into that!

# Get data
We will continue to work on the case study data from a mouse model of fetal growth restriction {% cite Bacon2018 %} (see [the study in Single Cell Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6945/results/tsne) and [the project submission](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6945/)).

In the previous tutorials, we first created an AnnData object and performed downstream analysis on that file. However, Monocle3 uses another datatype which is Cell Data Set (CDS). To be able to infer trajectories in Monocle, we need to transform our AnnData object into CDS file. And guess what - we already have a tutorial for that! We did it in [format conversion tutorial]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-data-ingest/tutorial.md %}), in the [Anndata -> Cell Data Set (CDS) subsection]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-data-ingest/tutorial.md %}#anndata---cell-data-set-cds). To better understand the structure of CDS object and learn how to create it from expression matrix, cell and gene annotations, it is highly recommended that you complete the mentioned tutorial before importing the prepared CDS file.

You have two options for uploading the dataset. Importing via history is often faster.

> <hands-on-title>Option 1: Data upload - Import history</hands-on-title>

> 1. You can import [history](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/j.jakiela/h/anndata---cds-conversion-for-monocle3-tutorial) where we went from AnnData to CDS file. Then you will also have access to extracted cell metadata, gene metadata, and an expression matrix. If you want to get the CDS file alone, you can get it in this [input history](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/j.jakiela/h/cds-input-file-for-monocle3-tutorial).

> Monocle3 turns the expression matrix, cell and gene annotations into an object called cell_data_set (CDS), which holds single-cell expression data. We provided you with the CDS file already, but it was created by combining the three mentioned elements. Check out [data conversion tutorial]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-data-ingest/tutorial.md %}#anndata---cell-data-set-cds) to see how to do it!
> Here is what [Monocle3 documentation](https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle3/docs/starting/) says about the three input files required to create a CDS object:
>    - **expression_matrix**: a numeric matrix of expression values, where rows are genes, and columns are cells. Must have the same number of columns as the cell_metadata has rows and the same number of rows as the gene_metadata has rows.
>    - **cell_metadata**: a data frame, where rows are cells, and columns are cell attributes (such as cell type, culture condition, day captured, etc.)
>    - **gene_metadata**: a data frame, where rows are features (e.g. genes), and columns are gene attributes, such as biotype, gc content, etc. One of its columns should be named "gene_short_name", which represents the gene symbol or simple name (generally used for plotting) for each gene.

# Monocle3 workflow

The Monocle3 workflow looks like the following, which should seem pretty similar to what you've done throughout the case study.

![Monocle workflow: scRNA-seq dataset, pre-process data (normalise, remove batch effects), non-linear dimensionality reduction (t-SNE, UMAP), cluster cells, compare clusters (identify top markers, targeted contrasts), trajectory analysis](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/monocle3_new_workflow.png "Workflow provided by Monocle3 documentation")

We will follow those steps and see how it all works in practice.


# Pre-processing

In Galaxy, there are currently 2 methods of initial dimensionality reduction included in the pre-processing step: principal component analysis (PCA) and latent semantic indexing (LSI).
Given that PCA is more commonly used, and it allows us to perform further steps on the CDS object, we’ll use this method. There is one parameter here that has a great impact on how our analysis will look - the `dimensionality of the initially reduced space`. This is a highly subjective choice - you will want to test a lot of different parameters on your dataset. After much trial and error, we were able to find the value that made the most sense biologically. Have a look at the image below to see how different values affect the outcomes.

![Six graphs showing the output of depending on the number of dimensions that the space was reduced to during pre-processing. Chosen numbers: 10 (really disjoint cell groups), 50 (disjoint cell groups), 150 (two bigger groups), 200 (cell groups start to come together), 250 (cell groups well aligned into a semicircle), 300 (cell groups start to fold and become biologically irrelevant)](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/num_dim_legend.jpg "Different outputs depending on the number of dimensions that the space was reduced to during pre-processing. Currently the label size in Monocle graphs in Galaxy is a nightmare, so for clarity additional legend was added to this image. We're working on the label size so that you can generate clear, readable and pretty graphs. However in this particular figure, the main point is to show the differences in shapes depending on the num-dim.")

But look - we want to infer trajectories and find relationships between cells, ideally we would see the development of cells or transition from one type to another. In the graphs where num-dim is from 10 to 200, you see that the clusters are quite disjoint, while we want to see smooth transitions from one to another. I can tell you now that we’ll go ahead with the value of **250**. We're not choosing 300, because the arrangement of the cells on that graph is not really biologically relevant.

#  Dimensionality reduction

Now it’s time for the proper dimensionality reduction, to turn the original thousands of dimensions (genes), into a 2-dimensional graph. There are several algorithms to do this: UMAP, tSNE, PCA and LSI (only possible when preprocess_method is set to `LSI`), but due to the same reasons as above, we’ll use UMAP (most common + allows further operations + best results). But I’ll let you see how the outputs from the other algorithms look to convince you that **UMAP** is indeed the best for this dataset. Of course, it's possible that by choosing different pre-processing values, tSNE or PCA plots would look better, so don't be afraid to play around with the parameters and test them!

![Four graphs showing the alignment of cell types depending on the algorithm of dimensionality reduction that was chosen: UMAP, tSNE, PCA, LSI. UMAP shows distinct cell groups, transitioning smoothly from one to another, creating kind of semicircle. tSNE shows distinct cell groups, however no smooth transitions are observed, all groups gathered into one big grouping. PCA shows cell groups whose boundaries are blurred between each other. On LSI graph, the cell types are all mixed together.](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/dim_red_methods.png "The preview of alignment of cell types depending on the algorithm of dimensionality reduction that was chosen: UMAP, tSNE, PCA, LSI. The methods were applied to the output of the PCA-preprocessed data (except LSI method which was called on LSI-preprocessed data). LSI failed in forming distinct cell groups, PCA managed to cluster cells according to their types but tSNE did it more precisely. However, UMAP gave the best results, not only showing distinct cell type groups, but also ordering them in a way that makes sense biologically - DN to T-mat.")

# Plotting

Alright, now let's have a look at our output! Above you got a sneak peek of how the plot would look, but now you’ll generate the plots on your own!

Thanks to the fact that we provided Monocle3 with annotated data, we can now color the cells by any attribute that was in the cell metadata file! Similarly to the previous tutorial, we’ll color them by cell type, genotype, batch and sex. At least for now...

The [Previous tutorial]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_basic-pipeline/tutorial.md %}) discussed in detail the biological interpretation of data, so we will quickly go through similar analysis to see if the results are consistent and if we can draw any new conclusions.


As a reminder, here's the comparision between cell type annotation done in the other tutorial using Scanpy, and the output from the previous step of this Monocle tutorial. The main difference is that Scanpy was used to identify the cell types and assign them to clusters. That data was then passed on to Force-Directed + PAGA algorithms to infer trajectory, and then the arrangement of the cell groups changed a bit. In Monocle, trajectory analysis will be based on the clustering you see now.

![Each cell type forms a distinct group but they lie next to each other: DN, DP-M2, DP-M3, then DP-M4 has DP-M1 on the right and DP-L on the left, and DP-L neighbors with T-mat](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/cell_types.png "Cells coloured in Monocle by their type.")

In the mentioned tutorial, we annotated the cells so that we know what type they are. Above you can see how Monocle used this information to colour cells by their type. It is important to see the 'form' of the graph and how the cell types are arranged within its confines. But why is it important? Well, in Monocle, our trajectory analysis will be based on the same arrangement of the cells that you see now. And if you now recall our choice of the number of dimensions during pre-processing, you'll understand why it was crucial - choosing the right value at the beginning determines the 'shape' of the graph that is then retained for the trajectory analysis. Therefore, the fact that on the plot above we clearly see DN cells on one side of the graph and T-mat on the other, going through DP cells, looks promising. But there is DP-M1 group that suspiciously branches out... Let's investigate that and wait until the trajectory is inferred!

> <question-title>Genotype</question-title>
> Based on our results, can we confirm findings from the previous tutorial that DP-L and mature T-cells (particularly the top half) are missing some knockout cells?

In the absence of batch correction, we will focus on those clusters where there is batch mixing for biological interpretation. Finally, we will look at the confounding effect of sex.

> >  There are also no female cells in DP-L and DP-M1. The one female sample - which is one of the mere three knockout samples - seems to be distributed in the same areas as the knockout samples at large. Luckily, this doesn’t seem to be a confounding factor and we can still learn from our data.

## Clustering

Don't get confused - we haven't clustered our cells yet, for now we have only plotted them based on cell type annotation. Now it's time to create clusters, which - in an ideal world where all computation picks up the exact biological phenomenons - would yield the same areas as the clusters determined by the Scanpy algorithms. Is this the case here? Do Monocle and Scanpy identify the same clusters?

Monocle uses a technique called "community detection" ({% cite Traag_2019 %}) to group cells. This approach was introduced by {% cite Levine_2015 %} as part of the phenoGraph algorithm.

Monocle also divides the cells into larger, more well separated groups called partitions, using a statistical test from {% cite Wolf_2019 %}, introduced as part of their [PAGA](https://github.com/theislab/paga) algorithm.

> <details-title>Clusters vs partitions</details-title>
>
> Clusters are particularly useful while trying to assign cells to a certain type, because they are based on the similarity in gene expression. The relationships between different clusters are analysed to identify possible trajectories.
>
> Partitions, meanwhile, are larger groups of cells that usually contain several clusters. Trajectory inference is performed only within one partition, so it is essential that all the cells that we want to analyse in pseudotime belong to the same partition.

# Gene expression

We haven't looked at gene expression yet! This step is particularly important when working with data which is not annotated. Then, based on the expression of marker genes, you are able to identify which clusters correspond to which cell types. This is indeed what we did in the previous tutorial using scanpy. We can do the same using Monocle3! Since we work on annotated data, we can directly check if the expressed genes actually correspond to the previously assigned cell types. If they do, that’s great - if two different methods are consistent, that gives us more confidence that our results are valid.
Below is the table that we used in the previous tutorial to identify the cell types.

| Marker | Cell type |
|--------------------|
| Il2ra    | Double negative (early T-cell)    |
| Cd8b1, Cd8a, Cd4    | Double positive (middle T-cell)|
| Cd8b1, Cd8a, Cd4 - high | Double positive (late middle T-cell)|
| Itm2a    | Mature T-cell |
| Aif1    | Macrophages    |

> The Hba-a1 gene creates hemoglobin which is found in red blood cells. This is highly expressed in a tiny bit of the middle DP cluster. Interestingly, it forms a a clearly visible, distinct, little branch. Hemoglobin should NOT be found in T-cells. However, if you remember, the gene was found to be expressed in the previous Scanpy tutorial (see the image below). That marker appeared throughout the entire sample in low numbers, suggesting some background contamination of red blood cell debris in the cell samples during library generation. Unlike Scanpy, Monocle algorithms allowed us to gather the cells expressing that gene into a distinct group! That's great!

# Top marker genes

Here we used a priori knowledge regarding the marker genes. If we wanted to approach this problem in an unsupervised manner, we could use Monocle to tell us the top marker genes in each group of cells. This is very useful if we are trying to identify a cell type, or if we want to find novel marker genes for known cell types.

But what if you want to know how gene expression changes across a trajectory? This is where Monocle is particularly powerful. But in order to do that, we have to infer that trajectory first!

# Learn the trajectory graph

We’re getting closer and closer! The next step is to learn the trajectory graph, which means to fit a principal graph within each partition. In that way, we’ll ‘connect’ the existing clusters by creating a path between them.

As you can see, the learned trajectory path is just a line connecting the clusters. However, there are some important points to understand here.
If the resolution of the clusters is high, then the trajectory path will be very meticulous, strongly branched and curved. There's a danger here that we might start seeing things that don't really exist.
You can set an option to learn a single tree structure for all the partitions or use the partitions calculated when clustering and identify disjoint graphs in each. To make the right decision, you have to understand how/if the partitions are related and what would make more biolgical sense. In our case, we were only interested in a big partition containing all the cells and we ignored the small 'dot' classified as another partition.
There are many trajectory patterns: linear, cycle, bifurcation, tree and so on. Those patterns might correspond to various biological processes: transition events for different phases, cell cycle, cell differentiation. Therefore, branching points are quite important on the trajectory path. You can always plot them, {% icon param-toggle %} checking the correct box in {% tool Monocle3 plotCells %}.

> <tip-title>Comparing the trajectories</tip-title>
>
> As a reminder, here's the comparision between our trajectory and the one from the previous tutorial, where we used Scanpy for clustering, and then appplied Force-Directed + PAGA algorithms to infer trajectory. As you remember from those tutorials, the arrangement of the cell groups changed a bit during these steps. Indeed - by using the mentioned methods, we get different graphs for clusters and trajectory, while in Monocle the general 'shape' of the graph stays the same from the beginning. 'Leranig the trajectory' step in Monocle is about finding a path, along which the cells can be then ordered in pseudotime.
> ![First graph shows the trajectory inferred by using Scanpy + Force-Directed + PAGA (DN connecting equally with DP-M2 and DP-M3, then going to DP-M1, and branching out to DP-M4, then going down to DP-L and finally turning into T-mat).  Second graph shows the trajectory inferred by using Monocle (DN connected to DP-M2 and DP-M3, then DP-M4 has DP-M1 on the right and DP-L on the left, and DP-L comes to T-mat).](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/scanpy_monocle_trajectories.png "Comparison between the trajectory inferred in the previous 'case study' tutorials (Scanpy + Force-Directed + PAGA) and the trajectory obtained in Monocle.")

# Pseudotime analysis

Finally, it's time to see our cells in pseudotime! We have already learned a trajectory, now we only have to order the cells along it. Monocle3 requires information on where to start ordering the cells, so we need to provide it with this information. We annotated early T-cells as double negative (DN), so those will be our root cells!

> <details-title>Pseudotime</details-title>
>
> To infer trajectories, we need data from cells at different points along a path of differentiation. The assumption is that in any given sample, some cells are further along a trajectory than others. This inferred temporal dimension is known as pseudotime. Pseudotime measures the cells’ progress through the transition.  See {% cite Reid_2016 %} for more.

Now we can see how all our hard work has come together to give a final pseudotime trajectory analysis. DN cells gently switching to DP-M which change into DP-L to finally become mature T-cells. Isn't it beautiful? But wait, don't be too enthusiastic - why on earth DP-M1 group branches out? We didn't expect that... What could that mean?

There are a lot of such questions in bioinformatics, and we're always get excited to try to answer them. However, with analysing scRNA-seq data, it's almost like you need to know about 75% of your data to make sure that your analysis is reasonable, before you can identify the 25% new information. Additionally, pseudotime analysis crucially depends on choosing the right analysis and parameter values, as we showed for example with initial dimensionality reduction during pre-processing. The outputs here, at least in our hands, are more sensitive to parameter choice than standard clustering analysis with Scanpy.

![Pseudotime plot, showing the development of T-cells – starting in dark blue on DN cells and ending up on mature T-cells, marked in yellow on pseudotime scale and (going in the opposite direction) DP-M1 branch which is marked in light orange.](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/pseudotime.png "Trajectory analysis - pseudotime")

Last but not least, you can now identify genes that define the inferred trajectories.

# Conclusion

{% icon congratulations %} Well done, you’ve made it to the end! You might want to consult your results with this [control history](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/j.jakiela/h/monoce3-tutorial-workflow) (which also includes AnnData to CDS conversion), and check out the [workflow](https://singlecell.usegalaxy.eu/u/j.jakiela/w/copy-of-trajectory-analysis-using-monocle3-1) for this tutorial. There is also a separate workflow for [preparing the input files for Monocle3, starting from AnnData](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/j.jakiela/w/copy-of-trajectory-analysis-using-monocle3), and [full analysis workflow](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/j.jakiela/w/copy-of-anndata-to-monocle-right-1). You can use them to accelerate analysis of your own data, paying attention to the requirements of the input data that are mentioned in this tutorial.

If you're following the Case Study tutorials from the beginning, you have already experienced what it’s like to analyse and question a dataset, potentially without clear cut-offs or clear answers. You now know that trajectory analysis is even more sensitive to parameter values, so it's often trying to find the best set of values that would give the most reasonable results and go in accordance with biology. Moreover, not all trajectory analysis methods are designed to infer all kinds of biological processes - due to the fact that they use different algorithms, some would work better for analysing your sample. Since Monocle is quite widely used for trajectory analysis, it might be a good practice to compare its results with other methods. The more evidence you have to confirm your findings, the more confident you can be about their reliability!
