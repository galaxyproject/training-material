Single cell RNA-seq analysis enables us to explore differences in gene expression between cells. It can reveal the heterogenity within cell populations and help us to identify cell types that could play roles in development, disease, or other processes. Single cell omics is a relatively young field, but there are a few commonly-used analysis pipelines that you will often see in the literature. In this tutorial, we will use one of these pipelines, Seurat, to cluster single cell data from a 10X Genomics experiment ({% cite seurat2023v5 %}). You can follow the same analysis using the Scanpy pipeline in the [Clustering 3K PBMCs with Scanpy]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-scanpy-pbmc3k/tutorial.md %}) tutorial. 

Clustering is typically the first type of analysis we will perform on a single cell dataset. It groups together cells that are expressing similar genes, which makes the data easier to understand and often helps us to identify specific cell types.

# Data

For this tutorial, we will analyze a dataset of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) extracted from a healthy donor, which is freely available from 10X Genomics. The dataset contains 2700 single cells sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500. The raw sequences have been processed by the [**cellranger**](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger) pipeline from 10X to extract a unique molecular identifier (UMI) count matrix, in a similar way to that explained in the [Pre-processing of 10X Single-Cell RNA Datasets]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-preprocessing-tenx/tutorial.md %}) tutorial.

In this matrix, the values represent the number of each feature (i.e. gene; row) detected in each cell (column). Single cell matrices can be quite large: here there are 2700 columns with 32,738 rows, so for each of our 2700 cells we know how many times we found RNAs matching each of the 32,738 genes. Since most of these genes weren't detected in most of the cells, the matrix is largely filled with zeros, i.e. it is an extremely sparse matrix. To optimize the storage of such a table and the information about the genes and cells, **cellranger** creates 3 files:

- `genes.tsv`: a tabular file with information about the 32,738 genes in 2 columns (Ensembl gene id and the gene symbol)
- `barcodes.tsv`: a tabular file with the barcode for each of the 2700 cells
- `matrix.mtx`: a condensed version of the count matrix (including the non-zero values only)

    The count matrix is represented by its non-zero values - we don't need to store all of those zeroes as long as we know where our non-zero values are in the matrix. Each non-zero value is represented by its line number (1st column), its column number (2nd column) and its value (3rd column). The first row gives the total number of rows (genes), columns (cells) and non-zero values. More information on the Matrix Market Exchange (mtx) format can be found [in this documentation](https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html)

Representing the matrix with these three files is convenient for sharing the data, but not for processing them. Different single cell analysis packages have attempted to solve the problem of storage and analysis by inventing their own formats, which has led to the proliferation of many different 'standards' in the scRNA-seq package ecosystem.

## SeuratObject

In order to analyse the data using Seurat, we will first need to create a SeuratObject. A SeuratObject can store all our data, including the gene names, cell barcodes and matrix in a single RDS file. Since Seurat was written in the R programming language, SeuratObjects are saved as RData or RDS files. An RDS file is simply a type of RData file that contains a single object.

SeuratObjects can also hold any metadata we might have about our cells or genes, as well as the information we will produce during our analysis, such as our dimensional reductions and cell clusters. A SeuratObject can hold data in multiple layers (also known as slots in earlier version of Seurat). We can have layers of raw counts, normalised data, and scaled data. We could also store multiple assays or types of data in a single object, although in this tutorial we will only be using one assay for RNA-seq data. The SeuratObject is designed to be self-contained so that we don't have to work with lots of different files, even if we have different versions or types of data. 

Creating a SeuratObject in R would require two steps - first, we would need to read in our data, in this case using the `Read10X` function, then secondly we would turn it into a SeuratObject using the `CreateSeuratObject` function. On Galaxy, we can perform both steps with a single tool. The `CreateSeuratObject` function also generates some QC metrics and performs basic filtering of the data.

{: .hands_on}

We can't look at the RDS file directly as it is designed for computers to read, rather than humans, but the Seurat tools will now be able to interact with the data. We can also use the {% tool Seurat Data Management %} tool to look inside our new SeuratObject.

> > 2. When we looked at the `matrix.mtx` file previously, we saw that it contained information on the same 2700 cells, but that there were 32,738 genes with non-zero values in the matrix. That means we are missing 19,024 genes - but don't worry, this is supposed to happen! Remember that we set the `Include features detected in at least this many cells` parameter to `3` - this got rid of any genes that were found in fewer than three cells. We assume that these genes are just technical noise (e.g. misreads, reads mapped to the wrong gene) rather than real biological features. We also set the `Include cells where at least this many features are detected` to `200` - this would have removed any cells that had fewer than 200 genes found in them. In this case, we didn't remove any cells as all 2700 of them must have had at least 200 genes. If we did have cells with fewer than 200 genes, we would want to get rid of them they are probably low quality cells or cell fragments. We would usually expect to find more features in an undamaged cell that was captured and sequenced properly.

The Seurat pipeline usually includes some filtering during object creation, which shouldn't cause any problems as long as we use reasonable thresholds that only filter out the lowest quality cells and genes.  We can always come back and create a new object with different values if we suspect they weren't right for our dataset once we make our QC plots or if we have problems later on in the analysis.

# Preprocessing

The standard Seurat pipeline begins with preprocessing, which includes identifying and filtering out low-quality cells, normalising and scaling the data, and selecting highly variable features.

## Quality Control

Quality control is an essential step in preparing single cell data for analysis. The results from a single cell experiment can vary in quality due to cell damage during dissociation, capturing more than one cell in a well or droplet, failures in library preparation such as inefficient reverse transcription (copying of captured RNAs to cDNA) or PCR amplification (making more copies of the cDNA so we have enough material for sequencing) or other technical problems. Low quality cells can cause issues for some analysis tools and may contribute to misleading results.

> <details-title>Impact of low-quality cells on the downstream analyses</details-title>
>
> #### Formation of their own distinct cluster(s)
>
> The most obvious cause of this problem is that damaged cells can appear more similar to each other because they have increased proportions of mitochondrial genes or are enriched for certain damage-induced genes. We could end up with a cluster made up of different cell types that share similar RNAs because they've been damaged. We might think these damaged cells represent an intermediate state between other cell types or end up misinterpreting our data in other ways.
>
> #### Distortion of population heterogeneity during variance estimation or principal components analysis
>
> When we cluster single cell data, we're looking for the biggest differences between groups of cells. If we have lots of low-quality cells, then the biggest differences we'll see might be these differences in quality, rather than something more biologically interesting. Differences in quality can have a big impact because low-quality cells often have low total RNA counts. When we perform scaling and normalisation on these cells during preprocessing, this can make the variances for the genes they do express much bigger than for other cells. When we select the most variable genes in the dataset, we'll end up picking the ones expressed by low-quality cells. We'll use these in our PCA analysis, likely ending up with top principal components based on cell quality rather than biology, making it harder to detect the differences we're actually interested in.
>
> #### Misidentification of upregulated genes
>
> Another problem that arises when we apply our preprocessing steps to small, low quality cells is that the genes we detect in them can appear to be strongly upregulated. Since we didn't detect many other genes in these cells, even a small difference in the number of transcripts detected can end up becoming much larger after normalisation. For example, contaminating transcripts may be present in all cells at low but constant levels. With the increased scaling and normalization in low-quality cells, the small counts for these transcripts may become large normalized expression values, so we might think we've found a population of cells where these genes are upregulated.
>
{: .details}

In order to mitigate these problems, we need to remove low-quality cells at the start of the analysis.

The `CreateSeuratObject` function we used in the {% tool Seurat Create %} tool automatically calculates some QC metrics and allowed us to filter out the lowest quality cells and features immediately. We will now check the data to see if it requires any further filtering.

### Computation of QC metrics

We already have two useful QC metrics that were calculated when we created our SeuratObject: 

- **nCount_RNA** the total sum of RNAs that were found in each cell.
    The total number of counts is related to cell size, but it can also be an indication of quality. If `nCount_RNA` is very high we might be looking at results from a doublet or multiplet - two or more cells that were isolated together during the experiment. If `nCount_RNA` is very low, then it is likely that we lost a lot of the RNA due to cell lysis (breakage) or inefficient cDNA capture and amplification - or perhaps we only captured a fragment of a cell. 
- **nFeature_RNA** the number of unique genes that were detected in each cell.
    We would expect to see some variation in the variety of genes expressed by cells of different sizes, types, and conditions, but if this number is unusually high or low then it could be a sign of poor quality. High `nFeature_RNA` could be another sign of a doublet or multiplet - we might have captured cells of different types and processed them together. Low `nFeature_RNA` could be due to loss of RNA if `nCount_RNA` is also low, or a sign that we have failed to capture the diversity of the transcript population, perhaps due to technical problems in our experiment. 

One other metric that is often used to assess cell quality is the proportion of reads that came from the mitochondrial genome. The proportion is often higher in low quality, damaged or dying cells. Mitochondrial RNAs, which are protected inside the mitochondrial membranes, can be the last RNAs to be degraded or lost from a damaged cell, so we can end up with higher proportions of them in a low quality cell. We could have calculated the proportion of mitochondrial genes while creating our SeuratObject, but we will calculate it separately here to see how it is done - and how we could do the same for other types of genes.

We can identify mitochondrial genes from their gene symbols. Human genes that are encoded in the mitochondrial DNA (rather than in the cell nucleus) have names beginning with 'MT-'. Different naming patterns are used in other species. The {% tool Seurat Create %} tool can identify genes based on a specific naming pattern and then calculate the proportion of reads in each cell that came from these genes. We could use this tool to calculate the proportions of other genes with shared naming patterns too, such as ribosomal genes.

> <hands-on-title>Calculate the Proportion of Mitochondrial Reads</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [Seurat Create](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/seurat_create/seurat_create/5.0+galaxy1) %} with the following parameters:

>        - *"Pattern/regex to match in gene names"*: `^MT-`
>
> 2. Rename the output as `Mitochondrial Annotations`
{: .hands_on}

When we use these QC metrics to remove low quality cells, we are assuming they are independent of the biological state of each cell, which isn't always the case in reality. For example, some cell types with higher energy demands may have higher proportions of mitochondrial reads because they have more mitochondria. We need to think carefully when deciding which metrics to use for filtering, but for now we will assume that these differences in our dataset are being driven by technical factors (e.g. cell damage, loss of RNAs, problems with capture and sequencing) rather than biological processes (e.g. cell types or conditions). We can therefore remove cells with poor values without misrepresenting the biology in downstream analyses.

### Filtering of low-quality cells

The simplest approch for identifing low-quality cells is to apply thresholds on the QC metrics. We assume that any cells beyond these thresholds are low quality cells and that this is due to those technical factors. Although this is a simple strategy, we will need to decide where to set our thresholds, and this will depend on the experimental protocol and biological system - there are no standard thresholds that we can use for every dataset. 

We can visualise the QC metrics to help us decide where to set our thresholds for filtering out low quality cells. We want to get rid of cells that have unusually high or low numbers of genes or unique features, as well as cells that have higher proportions of mitochondrial genes.

> > 1. The violin plots give us an overview of the cell sizes (nCount_RNA), number of unique genes (nFeature_RNA), and proportion of mitochondrial reads for our cells. We can see that most of the cells are grouped together near the bottom of each plot, but there are some outliers that have unusually high or low values of each metric. Cells with higher values of nCount_RNA are likely to be larger as they contained more RNA. Cells with higher values of nFeature_RNA had RNAs produced from lots of different genes, while those with low nFeature_RNA had RNAs produced from a smaller range of genes. Cells with high percent.mt had lots of reads from mitochondrial genes. Although there will be some natural variation in cell size, the range of genes being expressed, and mitochondrial content, we suspect that extreme values of these three metrics reflect low quality cells.
> > 2. The scatter plots show us how these QC metrics relate to each other. As expected, the cells with higher total RNA counts also tend to have higher numbers of unique features, but some cells have particularly high values of both - these could be doublets. The proportion of mitochondrial genes doesn't increase with cell size (total counts) in the same way. We can see a small number of cells that have very high proportions of mitochondrial reads despite having low total reads - these are likely to be damaged cells that have lost a lot of their non-mitochondrial RNAs.

{: .question}

We can now set our QC thresholds based on these plots. Unfortunately, there are no standard thresholds that can be applied to every dataset, so we need to look at our data and make this decision for ourselves. 

We've already filtered out the cells with the lowest total counts when we created the SeuratObject, so we'll focus on filtering the number of unique features and the proportion of mitochondrial reads. We saw on the scatter plots that the cells with high values for these two metrics also had the highest nCount_RNA values, so we'll actually be getting rid of the cells with the highest total counts too.

Seurat enables us to set the minimum number of cells that genes must be present in when we create the SeuratObject, but the pipeline doesn't usually include any further quality checks for genes. If we did need to do further filtering, we could do this in R by calculating an appropriate QC metric and subsetting the data.

> > 1. A threshold of 2500 seems sensible for this dataset. The violin plot for nFeature_RNA shows that most of our cells should be under this threshold, so we won't lose too much of our data. The scatter plot shows that the cells above this threshold also had unusually high values of nCount_RNA, which suggest they could include some doublets.
> > 2. A threshold of 5% should work for this dataset. As before, the violin plot shows that the majority of our cells are below this threshold, but in this case the cells above it had low total RNA counts, which suggests these could be damaged cells that had lost a lot of their other RNAs. Although there are few standards to guide us in single cell analysis, you will see the same 5% threshold for mitochondrial content used in many studies. It often works well, but it can filter out energetic cell types such as muscle cells, so we shouldn't apply this threshold without considering whether it works for our dataset. Some studies don't filter on mitochondrial reads at all!

{: .question}

We're setting QC thresholds based on our visual inspections of the data, but we could take different approaches too. We could calculate the interquartile range for our QC metrics and use this to set a threshold (e.g. maximum of 1.5 times the IQ range above the median). We could also try running the analysis with different thresholds to see how it affects the results - this could help us to see if we're excluding any biological variation, for example if we're filtering out a specific high-energy cell type with our mitochondrial threshold.

We can see in both the violin and scatter plots that the outliers have been eliminated from our dataset - we've removed the cells with high mitochondrial counts and/or unusually high numbers of detected genes. We hope that this means we've got rid of the poor quality cells without losing any real biological variation, but we can't really be sure.

## Further Preprocessing 

Now that we're happy with the cells left in our SeuratObject, we can begin preparing the data for analysis. Seurat provides two routes for preprocessing, one with separate tools for each step and another that combines all these preprocessing steps into a single tool, `SCTransform`.

> <comment-title></comment-title>
>
> `SCTransform` makes preprocessing quicker and easier because it combines several steps from the standard Seurat pipeline into one. `SCTransform` normalises and scales the data while also selecting highly variable features. It also takes a different approach to preprocessing that can be more effective at removing technical effects from the data.
>
> Once you are familiar with the separate steps, you might find it more effective and convenient to use `SCTransform`. The main difference to be aware of when using `SCTransform` is that the results will be stored as a new assay called `SCT` in the SeuratObject. You will need to use this assay in the following analysis steps, instead of the original `RNA` assay. After running `SCTransform`, `SCT` will be set as the default assay for the SeuratObject so the tools should automatically use the correct one. The methods and default settings used in `SCTransform` also differ from the standard pipeline, so you should expect to see some differences in your results compared to the other route.

{: .comment}

The usual preprocessing steps for single cell data are normalisation, selection of the most variable features, and scaling the data. The same steps are performed in slightly different ways by the separate preprocessing functions and SCTransform.

- **Normalisation**
    Normalisation deals with variations in the number of reads we counted for each cell that were caused by systemic technical differences. We might have captured more RNAs or produced more copies of them during the PCR amplification step in some cells. If we don't remove these differences then they could obscure the biological differences we're trying to explore. We could end up with clusters of cells based on how many RNAs we captured or copied rather than on their cell type.
    The default normalisation method for the separate `NormalizeData` tool in Seurat is `LogNormalize`, which simply divides the number of counts for each gene by the total counts for the cell, multiplies this by a scale factor (10,000 is the default), and then log-transforms the results. Essentially, we're working out how many counts we would have for each gene if we had produced 10,000 reads from each cell, instead of getting different numbers of reads from different cells. The log-transformation then increases the impact that genes that showed stronger relative differences in expression between cells will have on our analysis (e.g. a gene that is expressed at an average count of 50 in cell type A and 10 in cell type B should have a bigger impact than a gene that is expressed at an average count of 1100 in A and 1000 in B). The normalised data will be stored in the `data` layer of the SeuratObject. The unnormalised data will still be available in the `counts` layer.
    Although this form of normalisation is widely-used, it does assume that each cell originally had the same number of RNA molecules, which isn't the case when our samples contain cells of different types and sizes. SCTransform takes a different approach to normalisation that doesn't make the same assumption about the cells {% cite SCTransform2022 %}. Instead, it creates a model of the UMI counts that enables it to regress out variation in sequencing depth (nFeature_RNA) and pools information from genes with similar abundances to adjust the variances. The corrected counts will be stored in the `counts` layer of the new SCT assay. The log1p(counts) will be stored in the `data` layer and the pearson residuals will be stored in the `scale.data` layer.
- **Selection of highly variable features**
    Rather than use the entire dataset in every stage of the analysis, we can focus on the genes that provide the most information - the highly variable genes that showed the biggest differences in expression between cells. We assume that these bigger differences reflect genuine biological differences, while the smaller differences in expression seen in other genes is down to chance or technical noise. Focusing on the most variable genes can make biological differences clearer in single cell analysis.
    Feature selection can have a big impact on our analysis as we will run downstream analyses (e.g. PCA) on these genes. We will be comparing cells based on the expression of these variable genes. 
    Seurat's separate `FindVariableFeatures` tool selects the 2000 most variable genes by default, while `SCTransform` selects the top 3000 genes. We can select more variable genes when we use SCTransform because this method is better at removing technical effects from the data, so the additional variable features are more likely to represent biological variation.
  We may need to change this setting for some datasets to ensure we're selecting the most useful genes without including too many others.
- **Scaling**
    Scaling is a linear transformation that we apply to prepare our data for dimensional reduction. 
    The default scaling method for the separate `ScaleData` tool in Seurat shifts the expression of each gene so that the mean expression across all the cells is 0. It also scales the expression of each gene so that the variance across all cells is 1. Scaling ensures that highly expressed genes don't dominate the analysis too much - we're interested in differences in expression between cells, not in genes that are always highly expressed in all the cells. The results will be stored in the `scale.data` layer.
    SCTransform doesn't scale data in the same way - although it centers the data by default, it won't scale the data unless you select this option. Instead, SCTransform usually stores the pearson residuals in the `scale.data` layer, which don't need to be scaled to the same variance.
    By default, both approaches only center/scale the highly variable genes that we'll use for dimensional reduction, but it is possible to scale more genes if required.
- **Regression**
  The Seurat pipeline can include another step during preprocessing of our single cell data. We can regress out (or remove) the impact of unwanted sources of variation. We could use this technique to remove the effects of the cell cycle or the differences associated with the proportion of mitochondrial genes. The goal is to reduce differences that are related to factors we are not interested in as this can help the differences we are interested in (like those between cell types or experimental groups) stand out more.
    It is possible to use the `ScaleData` function to regress out unwanted variation, but the creators of Seurat recommend using `SCTransform` for preprocessing if you want to do any regression. `SCTransform` automatically regresses out variation associated with sequencing depth (unique counts or nFeature_RNA) and can also regress out other variables. If you choose to use SCTransform in this tutorial, then you'll regress out the variation associated with the proportion of mitochondrial content, just like in [Seurat's original version of this tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/sctransform_vignette.html)

The two preprocessing routes use different methods to select features, so they won't always end up with the same genes, although there are likely to be some similarities. `SCTransform` also returns 3000 variable genes by default, rather than the 2000 selected by `FindVariableFeatures`. We can select more features with `SCTransform` because its normalisation method is better at removing technical effects from the data, so we believe that these additional genes reflect subtler biological variations rather than technical differences.

Some of these genes don't tell us much about the data, for example they might be housekeeping genes that are expressed at similar levels in most of our cells. We want to find the genes that can tell us most about the differences between our cells, so we want to identify the genes whose expression varies most across the dataset - focusing on these highly variable features should help us to uncover the biological differences we're looking for.

# Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensional reduction is a key step in single cell analysis that simplifies our big, complex datasets enough to enable us to perform and understand further analyses. 

In single cell analysis, we're comparing cells based on their patterns of gene expression - we're looking for cells with similar transcriptomic profiles. Each gene represents a dimension of the data. If we only found two genes being expressed in our cells, we could represent them on a 2-dimensional plot. The two axes of the plot would represent the expression levels of the two genes. Each cell would become a point on the plot, positioned according to its expression of these genes. We might spot one group of cells with high levels of both genes and another group that expresses large amounts of one gene and not much of the other.

For datasets with thousands of genes, the concept is essentially the same: each cell's expression profile defines its location in the high-dimensional expression space. Each gene is still a dimension or axis on the plot and each cell can be positioned along these axes based on their expression. It's just much harder to imagine a plot with thousands of different axes - that's why we need dimensional reduction!

We don't have to think of the expression of each of our thousands of genes individually. The expression of some genes can be correlated if they are affected by the same biological process - cells that express a lot of one gene might also express higher levels of other genes that have similar functions. Instead of keeping the information from each of these genes as separate axes or dimensions, we can compress them into a single dimension (e.g. an 'eigengene'). We can do the same for all of the correlated groups of genes in our data, going from thousands of individual genes to perhaps 10, 20, or 50 grouped dimensions.

 Dimensionality reduction aims to reduce the number of separate dimensions in the data, which:

- reduces the computational work in downstream analyses to only a few dimensions
- reduces noise by averaging across multiple genes to obtain a more precise representation of the patterns in the data
- enables effective plotting of the data.

## Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that identifies the axes in high-dimensional space that capture the largest amount of variation. It is a simple, highly effective strategy that is widely used in data science, including for single cell omics.

The axes or dimensions identified by PCA will be ordered based on how much of the variation they explain. The first axis (or Principal Component, PC) is chosen so that it captures the greatest variance across cells. The next PC is the axis orthogonal to (uncorrelated with) the first that captures the greatest amount of the remaining variation across the cells. The third PC will be orthoganol to the first two and capture the greatest amount of the remaining variation, and so on. You can decide how many PCs you want to produce and then how many of these PCs you want to use in downstream analyses.

We assume that the top PCs are more likely to represent real biological variation in the data because this should affect multiple genes in coordinated ways, having a bigger impact on variation. Random technical or biological noise should affect each gene independently, without creating patterns of correlation or explaining much variation, so these effects should be represented in the later PCs. By using just the top PCs in our downstream analysis, we can therefore focus on the biological variation and eliminate some of the unwanted noise while also making our data easier to analyse. 

### Perform the PCA

We will start by calculating the top 50 PCs and then decide how many of these we want to use.

The standard Seurat pipeline performs the PCA on the Variable Features only, rather than the complete dataset. You can change this using the `features` parameter, but you will need to scale the chosen features using `ScaleData` before running the PCA, if you didn't already choose this option during the preprocessing stage as we did above.

### Visualise the PCA Results

We've now reduced our dataset to 50 dimensions or PCs that represent the expression of sets of correlated genes. Since we selected the option to output a list of the top genes, we can use the {% icon galaxy-eye %} icon on this output in our history to see which genes were most strongly associated with the top five PCs. We can see lists of the genes that had the strongest positive and negative scores for each PC - these are the correlated sets of genes that defined the PCs.

{% snippet faqs/galaxy/histories_dataset_item.md %}

Rather than just looking at a list of genes, we can also produce plots to help us better understand how our cells and genes relate to the PCs we have just computed. Let's start by finding out more about the genes that were most strongly associated with our top three PCs. We can do this with the `VizDimLoadings` plot, which shows the genes associated with each PC, how strongly each gene affected the PC, and whether it was positively or negatively correlated with the PC. The plots will look a bit different depending on which preprocessing approach you followed.

However, a gene that varied a lot won't necessarily be associated with a top PC unless its expression correlates with other variable genes - a group of correlated genes is likely to have a stronger impact than a single gene, even if that one gene varies a lot.

We would expect to see similar patterns for the other PCs.

{: .question}

Next, let's see how our cells are distributed along the top PCs. We can use `DimPlot` to create a 2-dimensional plot where each axis represents one of the PCs - being able to produce these plots is one of the benefits of dimensional reduction as it makes our data easier to interpret when we can see it on two axes rather than imagining it along thousands. If we're plotting the top PCs then we should see cells or clumps of cells spread along these axes. If PC1 is really explaining a lot of the variation in the data then we should see that there are cells with both high and low values along this axis - if they're all grouped together at one end of the axis then the PC wouldn't be telling us much about the differences between cells. We'd hope to see a similar effect along the next PCs, although it won't be as strong as for the top PC because that's the one that explained the most variation in the dataset. We should see similar relationships no matter which preprocessing approach we used, although of course the plots will look a bit different.

> If you've tried the [Clustering 3K PBMCs with Scanpy]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-scanpy-pbmc3k/tutorial.md %}) tutorial then you might notice that there are some differences in the relationships between the genes and PCs. Our top negative genes for PCs 2 and 3 (NKG7 and PPBP) here are among the top positively associated genes there. This is simply a mathematical quirk - in both cases, these genes are strongly associated with the top PCs, but we're just calculating or drawing our axes in the opposite direction. You should be able to spot some similarities in the plots between these two tutorials, especially in the PC2/PC3 plot, which looks like it has been flipped upside down!

This explains why MALAT1 is the top positive gene for PC1 in the separate preprocessing route but the top negative gene for PC1 in the SCTransform route - this axis is showing simiar differences, but the other way around.

We don't have to use PCs 1 and 2 as the axes. We can decide which PCs we want to plot our data along. We can also use the `FeaturePlot` function to colour the plots by the expression levels of specific genes to see how this relates to the PCs, so let's see how the top genes relate to the top three PCs.

Another option for visualising our PCA results is to use `DimHeatmap` to produce a heatmap of the PCA scores for the top genes in each cell. We can see which genes scored highly in the same cells and get an idea of how the scores varied across the dataset. We can look for groups of cells that had similar scores for a particular PC, suggesting that they share similar expression profiles - these groups of cells might become our clusters. We can also compare the patterns for different PCs. We would expect to see more similarities (genes with similar scores across cells and more cells grouping together) for the top PCs since these explain more of the variation in the data.

> Note that the cells aren't plotted in the same order in all of our heatmaps, so we can't compare the same cell (column) across multiple plots - the first column in our heatmap doesn't always represent the same cell. We have plotted the top 500 cells for each PC, which means there are lots of cells that aren't included in these plots. We are probably looking at different cells and/or cell orders on each plot. The cells that showed the strongest variation along PC1 aren't necessarily the ones that varied most along PC2, so they won't appear in the same place on the plots.

### Determine the 'dimensionality' of the dataset

We have reduced our dataset into 50 dimensions or PCs, but we don't necessarily need all these PCs to understand the biological variation between our cells. We can simplify our data even more by selecting a smaller number of PCs that still provide a robust representation of the data. Just like when we chose how many features to select, we're trying to find the number that will best represent the biology while getting rid of as much unwanted noise as we can. Including more PCs might help us capture more of the biological signal, but it will also increase the noise.

The DimHeatmap plots can give you an idea of which PCs are having the strongest effects on your dataset, but an Elbow Plot can provide a simpler option for selecting how many dimensions (PCs) we should use in the following analyses.

The Elbow Plot ranks the PCs based on the percentage of variance that each of them explains. We should see that the top PCs each explain a substantial amount of the data, but that there is a bend or elbow where the dots start lining up along the bottom axis. The PCs before the elbow explain most of the variation while those after the elbow don't provide much additional information, so we don't need to include them in our analysis.

The elbow or bend in our plot appears to be around PC9-10, so we'll use 10 dimensions in this tutorial, but you could justifiably choose anywhere between about PC7 to PC12 on the basis of this plot. It is usually better to err on the higher side than to get rid of PCs that might be useful. Sometimes it is worth repeating the analysis with different numbers of PCs to see how it affects the results.
> > As always, it is also important to consider biology when making your decision. In this case, an expert might have spotted that the genes strongly associated with PCs 12 and 13 are known markers for certain rare subtypes of immune cells (e.g. MZB1 is a marker for Plasmacytoid Dendritic cells). However, these cells are so rare that we're unlikely to find many in a dataset of this size, so these PCs might not be that useful here. In a larger dataset or one that was enriched for these cell types, we might decide to include these PCs in our analysis because of these genes. Since we only have 2700 cells, we can't be sure that this is a true biological signal rather than just noise, so we'll stick with the top 10 PCs on the basis of our Elbow Plot.

> > 1. The plot shows a sharp elbow or bend at around PC10, but there is a gradual slope down towards the x-axis after this rather than an immediate drop to the bottom. In order to capture some of this additional variation for our analysis, we might decide to include 30 PCs. The curve of dots is much flatter and closer to the x-axis after this point, so the additional PCs won't explain much more of the variation.
> > We can actually use more PCs when we preprocess with SCTransform than if we used the separate preprocessing tools because the more effective normalisation method seems to be better at removing technical effects from the data. When we preprocess with SCTransform, we assume that higher PCs are more likely to represent subtle biological variation rather than technical effects, so we might improve our results by including more of them.

# Cluster the Cells

The preprocessing and dimensional reduction we've performed were all done in preparation for what we actually want to do to understand our data - clustering. We want to find groups of cells that are expressing similar genes. You might already have spotted some cells grouping together in the DimPlots we produced from the PCA, but we don't want to rely on our eyes to pick out clusters. We will empirically define subpopulations of cells with similar expression profiles using a clustering algorithm.

Clustering summarises the data and allows us to describe a heterogeneous population of cells using a set of discrete and easily understandable cluster labels - each cell will be assigned to one specific cluster. Once we've explored which genes are being expressed in these clusters, we'll then be able to treat them as proxies for biological identities such as cell types or states. We'll be able to think of each cluster as a particular type of cell.

We will perform graph-based, unsupervised clustering in two steps to find out which cells are most similar to each other and how these similar cells can be grouped together:

1. **Computation of a neighborhood graph**

    First, we will build a graph where every cell is a node that is connected to its neighbors by a line or edge. The distances between cells (the lengths of these edges) will be based on a distance metric, which is calculated by comparing the values for our top PCs between each pair of cells. The edges are weighted based on the similarity between the cells, so that more weight is given to the connections between cells that are more similar based on their expression patterns. The cells that share the closest, most heavily weighted connections in the graph are the ones with the most similar expression profiles - they are each others' nearest neighbours. Seurat uses a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph, so it will draw edges (lines) between each cell and a certain number (k) of its nearest neighbours.
    
2. **Clustering of the neighborhood graph**

    Second, we will partition this graph into a number of highly interconnected groups, 'quasi-cliques', or communities. Seurat provides several different algorithms for clustering, but they all work to find the optimal way to organise the data into groups. Clustering algorithms will look for communities of cells that are more closely connected with each other than with the cells outside their group. Each community represents a cluster that we can use for downstream interpretation.

## Find Neighbors

Seurat includes a selection of different methods for computing a neighborhood graph, but we will stick to the default settings of using a Euclidean distance metric and the `annoy` method. We will need to decide how many nearest neighbors we want to include in our KNN graph - the value we want to use for `k`. The default for Seurat is to look for the 20 nearest neighbors for each cell.

The best approach to building the neighborhood graph and the optimal value for `k` will depend on the data we are analysing - sometimes we'll need to try a few options to find the right fit. We'll use Seurat's default value of 20 for now - we'll know how well it worked when we take a look at our clusters later.

## Find Clusters

Seurat also offers a variety of different clustering algorithms, including SLM, Leiden and Louvain. We will follow the default Seurat pipeline and use the Louvain algorithm.

We need to define a value for the resolution parameter, which determines the size of the clusters the algorithm will find. We'll set the resolution at `0.5` for now, or `0.8` if we used SCTransform for preprocessing, but this is one of those parameters that we'll often want to try a few different values for when working with single cell data. We'll set a higher resolution on the SCTransform route because we expect it to capture more of the biological variation, so we might be able to find more clusters.

> <comment-title></comment-title>
> Resolution is one of the key parameters you might need to change when performing clustering. It sets the 'granularity' of the clustering - you can choose a lower value to arrange your data into bigger clusters or use a higher resolution if you're looking for lots of little clusters. The best resolution can depend on how varied your cells are - do you think there are only a few different cell types or should your sample contain lots of different populations of cells? The resolution will usually need to be higher for larger datasets too. In most cases, a resolution of between 0.4 and 1.2 will work well - we're using a fairly low value here as we have a smaller dataset.

# Run non-linear dimensional reduction (UMAP/tSNE)

We have already performed dimensional reduction using PCA to simplify our data and make it easier to analyse, but PCA plots aren't always the best way to display our data. We will often want a plot that separates out our clusters more clearly. It can make our clusters easier to interpret and enable us to use plots to show differences in characteristics such as the expression levels of specific genes between clusters. However, we need to be cautious about over-interpreting these plots - they give us an overview, but we can only look at two dimensions at a time, so we aren't seeing all of the relationships between clusters. The cells can also end up being plotted on top of each other, so some of them can be hidden from view. We shouldn't try to draw conclusions just by looking at the plots, but rather use them to make it easier to understand and share the results from tests such as differential expression analysis.

Two options are available for non-linear dimensional reduction with Seurat on Galaxy: UMAP and tSNE. Both approaches try to learn the underlying structure of the dataset so that the cells that are most similar to each other can be placed closest to each other in the two-dimensional plots. Since we've already identifed clusters of cells with similar expression profiles, we should expect to see cells from the same cluster grouped together in the plots. However, these dimensional reduction techniques have their limitations as there is no way to fully represent our complex single cell data in just two dimensions. Both UMAP and tSNE prioritise preserving local distances in the data to make sure that cells that are very similar will be located close to one another on the plot, but in order to do this they may not be able to show the more global relationships as accurately.

In the Seurat pipeline, it is usually performed after clustering, but it shouldn't make any difference to your plots. You should end up with the same result if you run these steps the other way around, except that you won't be able to show your clusters on the plot if you haven't found them yet.

## Visualise UMAP

Now we can visualise the UMAP, just as we did with the PCA. We can also colour in the UMAP plot based on the expression of genes we're interested in - we'll start by seeing where the cells expressing the top genes associated with PCs 1-3 have ended up in the UMAP plot.

The other two big groups have been split up into different clusters by the algorithm, suggesting that there are some differences within them - this is one of the reasons we don't just want to rely on our eyes when identifying clusters.

The top positive and negative genes associated with PCs 1, 2, and 3 are expressed in different parts of the UMAP plot.  This makes sense, because we used the PCA to make the UMAP, so the cells that were at different ends of the PC axes should be in different parts of the UMAP plot too.

## Other ways to visualise clusters

UMAP plots aren't the only way to see what is going on with the clusters we've just identified - and they aren't always the best choice when we're interested in which cells express specific genes. For example, we can create violin plots to show the expression of our top six genes from the PCA across the clusters we've just identified.

Looking at the expression of these genes can tell us something about our clusters, but the top genes from the PCA aren't necessarily the ones that will tell us what our clusters represent. Our next step is to find these marker genes.

# Find Marker Genes

We have now identified and plotted our clusters, groups of cells that share similar expression profiles, but we don't yet know which genes are part of these cluster-specific profiles - although looking at the top genes associated with PCs 1-3 has given us some hints. We need to identify the genes that drive separation between clusters. These marker genes can then be used to assign biological sense (e.g. cell type) to each cluster, based on where we know these genes are usually expressed. We can also use them to identify subtler differences between clusters, such as changes in activation or differentiation state, based on the behaviour of genes in the affected pathways.

Marker genes are usually detected by their differential expression (DE) between clusters. We're looking for the genes that were expressed much more in one cluster than in the other(s). Seurat provides a number of statistical tests for quantifying these differences, with the Wilcoxon rank sum test as the default.

Seurat also provides different tools for finding markers using these tests so that we can ask various questions about how genes are differentially expressed between clusters or experimental groups. We can use `FindAllMarkers` to identify the markers of each cluster compared to all the other clusters or we can use `FindMarkers` to look for differences between specific clusters or groups. Let's try out some of these options on our dataset.

> <comment-title></comment-title>
> When we find markers using the Seurat tools on Galaxy, we will get two outputs: a CSV file and an RDS file. Both files contain the same content, a table of marker genes and the relevant statistics from the test, but in different formats. We'll be able to read the CSV table, while Seurat tools can interact with the RDS file. Seurat doesn't save the outputs from DE tests into the original SeuratObject by default. This means that we won't be able to use the RDS outputs from finding markers if we want to perform further analysis of our dataset - we'll need to use the output from the previous step instead as that is where all our expression data, metadata, reductions and neighborhood graphs are. However, we can use the RDS markers file for plotting and investigating our marker genes.

## Find Positive Markers for Every Cluster Compared to the Rest

Usually, the first question we'll want to ask is which genes define each of our clusters as this can help us to understand why we've ended up with these groups. If we're trying to learn more about a particular group of cells (e.g. a specific cell type or condition) then this can tell us which cluster or clusters these cells are in.

The `FindAllMarkers` option is the simplest way to do this as it will run the DE test for each cluster simultaneously. The results will tell us which genes set each cluster apart from all the rest of the clusters. We might find markers that are known to be expressed in specific cell types, which will enable us to start annotating our clusters.

We can look for both positive and negative markers, or limit the results to just the positive markers for the clusters. We'll start by looking for the positive markers of all clusters.

The output is a list of positive markers for each cluster, genes that were significantly more likely to be expressed by cells in that cluster than in the rest of the dataset.

Take a look at the second output, the CSV file. You can click on the dataset to see a quick peek of it in the history panel or use the {% icon galaxy-eye %} icon to see the full table in the main panel.

{% snippet faqs/galaxy/histories_dataset_item.md %}

The first column is the name of the marker gene. The following columns tell us the:

- **p_val** - unadjusted p-value
- **avg_log2FC** - log fold-change of average expression between the two groups, which is positive if expression was higher in the first group and negative if lower (in this case, the values are all positive as we only looked for positive markers)
- **pct.1** - percentage of cells in the cluster that express this gene
- **pct.2** - percentage of cells in the rest of the dataset that express this gene
- **p_val_adj** - adjusted p-value (Bonferroni correction using all features in dataset)
- **cluster** - which cluster the gene is a marker for
- (the first column with the gene names is also repeated at the end!)

Although there is a lot of information here, all we need to know for now is that the markers listed for each cluster are the genes that were expressed more by these cells than any of the other clusters. We can search online for these genes to get an idea of what types of cells are in our clusters. We can always search within these results or filter them to include the ones we're interested in - for example, we could look at the markers for cluster 2.

## Find Markers of Cluster 2

If we are interested in a specific cluster, we might want to find out which genes set this cluster apart from all the rest. We can look for genes that are more likely to be expressed in this cluster (positive markers) and ones that are less likely to be expressed (negative markers). We might do this if we're particularly interested in one cell type or group.

Let's try finding the positive and negative markers of cluster 2.

The results from this test will look a little different than when we were comparing markers for all the clusters. 

The first column is still the name of the marker gene. The following columns tell us the:

- **p_val** - unadjusted p-value
- **avg_log2FC** - log fold-change of average expression between the two groups, which is positive if expression was higher in the first group and negative if lower
- **pct.1** - percentage of cells in the first group that express this gene (in this case, cluster 2)
- **pct.2** - percentage of cells in the second group that express this gene (in this case, all other clusters)
- **p_val_adj** - adjusted p-value (Bonferroni correction using all features in dataset)
- (again, the gene names are repeated at the end)

We don't have a cluster column this time as we were only testing one group against another (in this case, cluster 2 against all the rest of the clusters).

## Find Markers Distinguishing Cluster 5 from Clusters 0 and 3

We just used `FindMarkers` to run the same test on cluster 2 as `FindAllMarkers` performs for all the clusters, but we can also use it to ask different questions. If we are interested in what makes one cluster different from another, then we might want to look for genes that are differentially expressed between two specific clusters. We can also choose to compare expression with more than one cluster. We might do this if we want to focus on differences between two specific cell types, without considering what makes them different from the rest of the dataset - this could be handy if we have two very similar cell types or subtypes.

If we go back to our `FindAllMarkers` table, we'll see that these aren't exactly the same as the top five markers for cluster 5 when we compared it to all of the rest of the dataset (remember you can filter the results of `FindAllMarkers` again if you get bored of scrolling all the way down to cluster 5!).

## Find the cluster <span class='Separate-Preprocessing-Steps'>0</span><span class='SCTransform'>2</span> markers with the highest 'classification power'

We can also use other methods for DE analyis in Seurat. We can use the 'ROC' test to find out the 'classification power' of marker genes for our clusters. A classification power of 1 means that the expression level of this gene can perfectly assign cells to this cluster. A classification power of 0 means that the expression of this gene is useless for identifying cells in this particular cluster - it's completely random!

In this case, we might want to go back to the QC steps. We could score the cells for `percent.ribo` in the same way we did for `percent.mt`. We could then filter out cells with unusually high proportions of ribosomal genes or regress out the variation associated with this characteristic during the scaling step. Just as when we're filtering cells by mitochondrial RNA proportions, we would need to think carefully about this - we wouldn't want to eliminate a cell type just because it has higher proportions of ribosomal genes, which is what we could end up doing if we tried it with this particular dataset.

# Identify Cell Types

Now that we've arranged our data into clusters, we can start to identify the cell types forming each cluster. We can do this by looking for clusters that express genes that we know a certain type of PBMC should express. We can also check that the clusters don't express genes that we wouldn't expect to see if we know any negative markers for a particular cell type.

We can take two different approaches when identifying our cells:

1. **Unsupervised:**
    We could start with our list of marker genes and then see if they are known to be expressed in specific cell types. In this case, we are starting with what the data tells us - the list of genes produced by our DE tests.
2. **Supervised:**
    We could start with a list of known marker genes for each cell type we expect to see in our data, then look to see which clusters are expressing these genes. With this approach, we are starting with a list of genes selected from previous research and then searching from them in our data - we're choosing or 'supervising' the genes we use.

If we're taking the unsupervised approach, then we might want to limit our markers to the ones that showed the biggest differences in expression. We can do this using some of the extra parametes provided by `FindAllMarkers`. Let's refine the parameters to find the top 10 positive markers for each cluster that showed a log fold change of at least 1 (meaning their expression was at least twice as high).

><hands-on-title>Find the Top 10 Positive Markers for Each Cluster</hands-on-title>

{: .hands_on}

We could now search online or in a database such as [PanglaoDB](https://panglaodb.se/) or the [Human Protein Atlas](https://www.proteinatlas.org/) to find out which cell types express the markers we've identified for each cluster. If we look at the top 10 markers for cluster 3, we see that the first gene in the list is CD79A.

> <question-title></question-title>
> 1. Which type of cells express CD79A?

> > 
>  {: .solution}
{: .question}

If we were to continue with this unsupervised approach, we would look at more of the top markers for cluster 3 to check that they are expressed by the same cell type as CD79A. We would then repeat the process for the rest of our clusters.

The unsupervised approach might be the only option if we don't know exactly what we're looking for - we might be investigating rare cell types, working with samples from an understudied species, or looking at the changes that happen in a particular disease. However, in many cases, we can use what we already know to begin to understand our dataset. We can look for genes that previous research has identified as markers for the cell types we expect to see. We won't always get all the answers we need from a supervised approach like this, but it can be a quicker way to identify known cell types. 

A supervised approach should work well for the current dataset because PBMCs have been very well characterised. We know which cell types should be present in a PBMC sample and which genes each of these cell types should be expressing.

The suggested marker gene for B cells isn't our top marker, CD79A, but MS4A1. If we look back at our table of the top 10 markers, we can see that this was actually the second gene in the list, so if we'd continued with the unsupervised approach we'd have ended up using the same gene to help identify our B cells. Both of these genes are actually very good markers for B cells, so some lists of B cell markers might suggest using CD79A rather than (or in addition to) MS4A1. If we plot the expression of both genes across our clusters, we should be able to see where our B cells are.

</div>

Both CD79A and MS4A1 are mainly expressed in cluster 3, with very little expression in any of the other clusters. Since most cells in cluster 3 are expressing these two well-known markers of B cells and our DE test showed they were expressed more by this cluster than in the rest of the data, we can confidently say that cluster 3 represents our B cell population.

Sometimes the results aren't quite so clear as markers might be expressed across multiple clusters of the same or different cell types. We might need to use multiple markers to differentiate between these groups - as with T cells in this dataset.

![The first violin plot shows IL7R expressed in clusters 0, 2 and 4 (although there is some lower level expression in cluster 7). Second plot shows high CCR7 expression in cluster 0 with some expression in cluster 2. Plot 3 shows S100A4 expression across most clusters, including at high levels in cluster 2. Fourth plot shows CD8A expression in cluster 4.](../../images/scrna-seurat-pbmc3k/seurat_violin_T_cell_markers.png "Violin plots showing expression of IL7R, CCR7, S100A4, and CD8A by cluster")

We can see that IL7R (also known as CD4+) is mainly expressed in clusters 0, 2, and 4, with some expression in cluster 7. If we were using this marker alone, we could only identify these as clusters of T cells - and in the case of cluster 7, we would be making a mistake as once we plot markers of other cell types, we'll see that these aren't T cells at all!

If we look at which other markers are being expressed (or not expressed) by the T cell clusters, we can identify different types of T cells. Expression of CCR7 is associated with naive T cells, while S100A4 is associated with memory T cells, so you should be able to identify clusters of naive and memory CD4+ T cells in these plots. We can also see that some of our cells are expressing CD8A as well as CD4, so these are CD8+ T cells. We'll label these clusters below after looking at our other cell type markers.

We can see that IL7R (also known as CD4+) is mainly expressed in clusters 0, 2, 4, 8, and 10. With this marker alone, we could only identify these as clusters of T cells, but if we look at which other markers are being expressed (or not expressed) by these T cell clusters, we can identify different types of T cells. To start with, we can see that two of these clusters, 4 and 8, are also expressing CD8A, which identifies them as CD8+ T cells. The expression of CD8A also helps us to identify one more cluster of T cells that we wouldn't have spotted using CD4 alone - cluster 7.

We can use the rest of our T cell markers to identify different subtypes of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. For our CD4+ cells, expression of CCR7 is associated with naive T cells, while S100A4 is associated with memory T cells. We also have some CD4+ T cells expressing ISG15 and IL32, which marks them as IFN activated T cells. For the CD8+ clusters, we can again use CCR7 to pick out the naive T cells, but we will use CCL5 to identify the memory T cells. We can also spot a third group of CD8+ T cells that are expressing GZMK, which identifies them as effector T cells.

You should be able to identify clusters of all six of these T cell subtypes in your plots. Using SCTransform for preprocessing has allowed us to break down our T cells into more clusters than if we used the separate preprocessing tools. It looks like these include additional subtypes of CD8+ T cells, as we have three clusters expressing CD8A alongside different T cell subtype markers, when we would only have one cluster of CD8+ cells if we used the separate preprocessing steps. We'll label all of these clusters later, after looking at the markers for other cell types.

> How do you know which markers to use to identify different cell types? 
> Unfortunately, there isn't always an easy answer - it depends on how well defined the cell types you're interested in are. A quick search online or a look through the literature should give you an idea of which markers other people have used to identify the cell types you expect to see in your sample. You could look for genes that have been identified by previous single cell studies or ones that are used to identify or isolate a specific cell type. For well studied cell types like PBMCs, it should be easy to find lists of canonical markers that are often used.
{: .comment}

To continue with the supervised approach, we can check the expression of the chosen markers in our clusters to see if they match the known expression patterns of specific cell types. We could just look for these genes in our list of the top positive markers, but there are also several options for visualising marker gene expression. We'll try a few of them here to give you an idea of the types of plots you can use in the future.

We have produced a series of UMAP plots, each coloured according to the expression level of a different marker gene. We can look back at the UMAP plots we created earlier showing the cluster numbers to see which areas correspond to specific clusters.

> 1. Are the markers clearly associated with one or more clusters?

> > 1. Each cell type marker is clearly expressed at higher levels in certain parts of the plots - we don't have the same problem as we did when we plotted the top genes for PCs 1-3 and found that MALAT1 was expressed at quite high levels across the entire plot! When we compare the expression plots to the clusters we previously plotted, we can see that they match up quite well with each other. Most of the markers are expressed more in certain clusters, but there isn't always a clear boundary, especially for clusters that are close together in the plot. Some markers are associated with a single cluster, such as MS4A1 and PPBP, while others are expressed across multiple clusters.
> > 2. Although marker expression mainly occurs in one or more clusters, there is still some expression by cells in other parts of the plot. It could be that these genes are sometimes expressed by other cell types, but these could also be cells of the same type that have simply ended up further away in the plot. It can sometimes be hard to tell which cluster these cells have been assigned to from these plots, especially when you consider that some points could be hidden behind others. Cells of the same type might have been assigned to different clusters, but there could also be a few cells that have been plotted at a distance from where the main part of their assigned cluster appears on this plot. <span class-'Separate-Preprocessing-Steps'>If we look back at the UMAP coloured by cluster, we can spot a couple of differently coloured cells at the tip of cluster 7 and by cluster 8.</span><span class='SCTransform'>If we look back at the UMAP coloured by cluster, we can spot a couple of differently coloured cells and mixed into cluster 3 and at the tip of cluster 10.</span>

Some of the clusters are more similar to each other, particularly those that are close together on the plot, forming part of the same larger group of cells. <span class-'Separate-Preprocessing-Steps'>For example, clusters 1, 5 and 7 are grouped together on the plot and all express a lot of LYZ, S100A4, and CST3.</span><span class='SCTransform'>For example, clusters 1 and 6 are grouped together on the plot for and both express a lot of S100A4 and CST3.</span> Since the UMAP was created based on the PCA, which was in turn based on similarities in expression of the highly variable genes, it makes sense that clusters that are plotted closer together are more similar in expression to each other. However, we should always remember that we're only looking at a 2D plot of the first two UMAP dimensions, so we shouldn't read too much into what we see! The plot can't tell us everything about the relationships between cells and clusters.

Another option for visualising marker gene expression across clusters is the Violin Plot, which can sometimes make it easier to distinguish between clusters. Each cluster is plotted separately, so we don't need to work out which cluster a cell belongs to, which can be tricky when we have similar clusters close together and often overlapping on the UMAP plot.

Some of the markers are clearly expressed mainly in one or a few clusters, while others like LYZ and S100A4 are expressed across most of the clusters.
> > 2. None of the markers are unique to a specific cluster - there are always a few dots (or cells) in the other clusters that are expressing these genes. We can also see that the expression level varies within each cluster as there are cells at different positions along the vertical axis. As well as looking at the expression level in individual cells (dots) we can compare the overall expression patterns by looking at the coloured violin shapes, which show us where most of the cells in each cluster are plotted. For example, we can see there was more variation in the expression level of NKG7 in cluster 4 (where the violin shape is longer) than there was in cluster <span class='Separate-Preprocessing-Steps'>6</span><span class='SCTransform'>5</span> (where there is a short violin shape as all the cells showed high expression of this gene).
> > 3. Each cluster has a unique pattern of expression of the canonical markers. Some clusters are very distinct as they express markers that are rarely seen in other clusters. Cluster 3 is the only cluster to express MS4A1 and it doesn't express much of the other markers. Other clusters seem to be more similar to each other, with multiple clusters of T cells all expressing IL7R, although the expression levels of other genes vary between these cells allowing us to classify them as different subtypes. This makes sense because cluster 3 is far away from all the other clusters in the UMAP while the different T cell clusters are close to each other because of their similarities.

## Canonical Markers vs Marker Genes

We've now annotated our clusters by cell type using the supervised approach, but let's try making one more type of plot that we could have used during this process. We can make heatmaps of the canonical markers for each cell type and of the top markers for each cluster to see how expression of these genes varies within and between our clusters.

In order to create a heatmap, we need to prepare a tabular file with a list of the genes we want to plot. For the canonical markers, you could create this table outside of Galaxy and then upload it or follow the first step below to create the file in Galaxy.

Rather than looking at the canonical markers, we might want to make a heatmap of the top markers from our DE analysis.
In order to do this, we'll need to turn the output from `FindAllMarkers` into a tabular file type. We can then cut out the column with the list of gene names, getting rid of the column header, and use this as an input for the plot.

Looking at these plots, we can see that there are clear associations between certain genes and clusters. In both cases, we can also see that there is variation in the expression level of these genes within the associated clusters, with some cells expressing little or none of the gene. We can also see cells outside of the associated clusters that are expressing the genes. This is true for both the known cell type markers and the markers we identified through our DE analysis - even when a statistical test has identified a significant association with one cluster, there are still differences between cells.

Comparing the two plots also shows us why the supervised approach can be faster - we had fewer genes to consider and the patterns can also be a bit clearer. If we know enough about the cells we're trying to identify, then we can make our lives easier by taking the supervised approach. However, it is always a good idea to try multiple approaches when we can, as we'll have more confidence in our results if they both end up giving the same answers!

It's also good to be able to confirm your interpretation on multiple plots! 
> > UMAP plots are often used to provide a quick and memorable overview of the data, but it can be tricky to match the expression patterns to the clusters, especially given the limitations of these plots - some cells can be hidden, adjacent clusters can blend into each other, and we can't rely on the 2D plot to accurately represent all the relationships between cells and clusters.

However, heatmaps can be less useful if we want to focus on individual cells or genes, as it can be hard to pick out details.
> > 2. We should be happy with the results of our clustering as they match up with what we already know about PBMCs. We have been able to annotate each cluster as a different cell type based on a supervised approach - and we could do the same using an unsupervised approach. The decisions we made along the way, such as the number of PCs we used and how many nearest neighbors we looked for have worked well. We even identified some subtypes of T cells, although we were able to separate out more of these when we used SCTransform.
> > Even though many of the top markers for cluster <span class='Separate-Preprocessing-Steps'>0</span><span class='SCTransform'>2</span> were from ribosomal genes, we were still able to identify it as a specific cell type. It represents our population of Naive CD4+ T cells. If we search online to learn a bit more about this cell type, we'll quickly find that it is known to have lots of ribosomes, so in this case, we can be confident that the high expression of ribosomal genes in these cells is due to real biological differences between cell types, rather than a problem with our data. If we weren't able to assign a cell type to this cluster, for example because it expressed a mix of markers for different types, then we would come to a different conclusion!
> > If we couldn't see strong associations between our clusters and the different cell types that we expect to see in the dataset, then this would be very suspicious - did something go wrong with our experiment or analysis? We would need to go back and try to identify the problem to see if we can fix it. If the problem isn't too bad, we might just need to change some of the clustering parameters to get clusters that make biological sense - maybe we would need to use more PCs, look for more/fewer nearest neighbors, or simply change the resolution. If the problem is more serious, we might need to recheck the quality of our data or make bigger changes to the analysis.

# Conclusion
{% icon congratulations %} Well done, you've successfully used Seurat to prepare and cluster single cell data. You might want to check your results against the example histories for the [separate preprocessing steps](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/marisa_jl/h/clustering-3k-pbmcs-with-seurat---separate-preprocessing---answer-key) or [SCTransform route](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/marisa_jl/h/clustering-3k-pbmcs-with-seurat---sctransform---answer-key). You can also take a look at the whole workflow for [the separate steps](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/marisa_jl/w/copy-of-cluster-3k-pbmcs-with-seurat---workflow) or [SCTransform version](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/marisa_jl/w/cluster-3k-pbmcs-with-seurat---workflow---sctransform-version).

In this tutorial, we've learned about the steps involved in clustering single cell data and how to identify different cell types. We followed a typical clustering workflow:

1. Preprocessing with
    - selection and filtering of cells based on quality metrics
    - normalisation and scaling
    - selection of features (highly variable genes)
2. Dimensional reduction
    - using PCA and then UMAP
3. Clustering of the cells by
    - computation of a neighborhood graph
    - clustering the neighborhood graph into communities
4. Identification of marker genes for the clusters
5. Annotation of the clusters with cell types

Now that you know how to perform clustering with Seurat, you might want to try the alternative Scanpy pipeline by following the [Clustering 3K PBMCs with Scanpy]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-scanpy-pbmc3k/tutorial.md %}) tutorial. If you would prefer to stay with Seurat, then you could go back and try using the alternative preprocessing steps described above or try using it to analyse a slightly trickier dataset by following the 'Filter, plot and explore single cell RNA-seq data with Seurat' tutorial [using Galaxy buttons]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_FilterPlotandExplore_SeuratTools/tutorial.html %}) or in an [R notebook on Galaxy]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_FilterPlotandExploreRStudio/tutorial.html %}). You could also try using Seurat to analyse your own data!
