questions:
- Is my single cell dataset a quality dataset?
- How do I generate and annotate cell clusters?
- How do I pick thresholds and parameters in my analysis? What's a "reasonable" number, and will the world collapse if I pick the wrong one?
objectives:
- Interpret quality control plots to direct parameter decisions
- Repeat analysis from matrix to clustering
- Identify decision-making points
- Appraise data outputs and decisions
- Explain why single cell analysis is an iterative (i.e. the first plots you generate are not final, but rather you go back and re-analyse your data repeatedly) process
time_estimation: 3H
key_points:
- Single cell data is huge, and must have its many (# genes) dimensions reduced for analysis
- Analysis is more subjective than we think, and biological understanding of the samples as well as many iterations of analysis are important to give us our best change of attaining real biological insights

# Introduction


You've done all the work to make a single cell matrix, with gene counts and mitochondrial counts and buckets of cell metadata from all your variables of interest. Now it's time to fully process our data, to remove low quality cells, to reduce the many dimensions of data that make it difficult to work with, and ultimately to try to define our clusters and to find our biological meaning and insights! There are many packages for analysing single cell data - Seurat {% cite Satija2015 %}, Scanpy {% cite Wolf2018 %}, Monocle {% cite Trapnell2014 %}, Scater {% cite McCarthy2017 %}, and so forth. We're working with Scanpy, because currently Galaxy hosts the most Scanpy tools of all of those options.

> <comment-title>Tutorials everywhere?</comment-title>
> This tutorial is similar to another fantastic tutorial: [Clustering 3k PBMC]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-scanpy-pbmc3k/tutorial.md %}). That tutorial will go into much further depth on the analysis, in particular the visualisation and science behind identifying marker genes. Their experimental data is clean and well annotated, which illustrates the steps beautifully. Here, we work more as a case study with messier data, to help empower you in making choices during the analysis. We highly recommend you work through all the galaxy single cell tutorials to build confidence and expertise! For trainers, note that there are small-group options in this tutorial.

## Get data

We've provided you with experimental data to analyse from a mouse dataset of fetal growth restriction {% cite Bacon2018 %}. This is the full dataset generated from [this tutorial]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_alevin-combine-datasets/tutorial.md %}) if you used the full FASTQ files rather than the subsampled ones (see the [study in Single Cell Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6945/results/tsne) and the [project submission](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6945/)). You can find this dataset in this [input history](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/h/cs3-answerkey) or download from Zenodo below.

# Filtering

You have generated an annotated AnnData object from your raw scRNA-seq fastq files. However, you have only completed a 'rough' filter of your dataset - there will still be a number of 'cells' that are actually just background from empty droplets or simply low-quality. There will also be genes that could be sequencing artifacts or that appear with such low frequency that statistical tools will fail to analyse them. This background garbage of both cells and genes not only makes it harder to distinguish real biological information from the noise, but also makes it computationally heavy to analyse. These spurious reads take a lot of computational power to analyse! First on our agenda is to filter this matrix to give us cleaner data to extract meaningful insight from, and to allow faster analysis.

## Generate QC Plots

We want to filter our cells, but first we need to know what our data looks like. There are a number of subjective choices to make within scRNA-seq analysis, for instance we now need to make our best informed decisions about where to set our thresholds (more on that soon!). We're going to plot our data a few different ways. Different bioinformaticians might prefer to see the data in different ways, and here we are only generating some of the myriad of plots you can use. Ultimately you need to go with what makes the most sense to you.

{% icon time %} **Top time-saving advice** - turn the following QC plots into a workflow so you can re-run it easily throughout analysing your own data!.

## Analysing the plots

That's a lot of information! Let's attack this in sections and see what questions these plots can help us answer. The *scratchbook* {% icon galaxy-scratchbook %} may help here to look at the different plots at the same time!

Possibly, in this case, given that these cells were generated by growth restricted neonatal mice, and in which case we donât need to worry about our good data, but rather keep this in mind when generating clusters, as we donât want depth to define clusters, we want biology to!

Any bioinformatician will tell you that the best way to get clean data is in the lab, not the computer! Sadly, absolute best practice isnât necessarily always a realistic option in the lab - for instance, that mouse line was long gone! - so sometimes, we have to make the best of it. There are options to try and address such discrepancy in sequencing depth. Thus, weâre going to take these samples forward and see if we can find biological insight despite the technical differences.

Now that we've assessed the differences in our samples, we will look at the libraries overall to identify appropriate thresholds for our analysis.

These cells are low quality, will muddy our data, and are likely stressed or ruptured prior to encapsulation in a droplet.

## Apply the thresholds

It's now time to apply these thresholds to our data! First, a reminder of how many cells and genes are in your object: `31178 cells` and `35734 genes`. Let's see how that changes each time!

Note that the {% icon tool %} **Scanpy Filtercells** allows you to put {% icon param-repeat %} multiple parameters at the same time (i.e. filter `log1p_total_counts`, `log1p_n_genes_by_counts`,and `pct_counts_mito`) in the same step. The only reason we aren't doing that here is so you can see what each filter accomplishes. As such, examine your plot and general information.

Here's a quick overall summary for easy visualisation if you fancy it.
![Violinplot-Summary](../../images/scrna-casestudy/wab-violins2gether.png "Filtering summary")

Fantastic work! However, you've now removed a whole heap of cells, and since the captured genes are sporadic (i.e. a small percentage of the overall transcriptome per cell) this means there are a number of genes in your matrix that are currently not in any of the remaining cells. Genes that do not appear in any cell, or even in only 1 or 2 cells, will make some analytical tools break and overall will not be biologically informative. So let's remove them! Note that `3` is not necessarily the best number, rather it is a fairly conservative threshold. You could go as high as 10 or more.

In practice, you'll likely choose your thresholds then set up all these filters to run without checking plots in between each one. But it's nice to see how they work!

Using the final `General - Filtered object`, we can summarise the results of our filtering:

|       | Cells | Genes |
|------ |--------------------|
| Raw | 31178    | 35734    |
| Filter genes/cell | 17040    | 35734    |
| Filter counts/cell | 8678    | 35734    |
| Filter mito/cell | 8605   | 35734    |
| Filter cells/gene | 8605    | 15395    |

{% icon congratulations %} Congratulations! You have filtered your object! Now it should be a lot easier to analyse.

# Processing

So currently, you have a matrix that is 8605 cells by 15395 genes. This is still quite big data. We have two issues here - firstly, you already know there are differences in how many transcripts and genes have been counted per cell. This technical variable can obscure biological differences. Secondly, we like to plot things on x/y plots, so for instance *Gapdh* could be on one axis, and *Actin* can be on another, and you plot cells on that 2-dimensional axis based on how many of each transcript they possess. While that would be fine, adding in a 3rd dimension (or, indeed, in this case, 15393 more dimensions), is a bit trickier! So our next steps are to transform our big data object into something that is easy to analyse and easy to visualise.

> <hands-on-title>Normalisation</hands-on-title>

> 1. {% tool [Scanpy NormaliseData](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/ebi-gxa/scanpy_normalise_data/scanpy_normalise_data/1.8.1+galaxy0) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Input object in AnnData/Loom format"*: `Filtered Object`
{: .hands_on}

Normalisation helps reduce the differences between gene and UMI counts by fitting total counts to 10,000 per cell. The inherent log-transform (by log(count+1)) aligns the gene expression level better with a normal distribution. This is fairly standard to prepare for any future dimensionality reduction.

Now we need to look at reducing our gene dimensions. We have loads of genes, but not all of them are different from cell to cell. For instance, housekeeping genes are defined as not changing much from cell to cell, so we could remove these from our data to simplify the dataset. We will flag genes that vary across the cells for future analysis.

{: .hands_on}

Next up, we're going to scale our data so that all genes have the same variance and a zero mean. This is important to set up our data for further dimensionality reduction. It also helps negate sequencing depth differences between samples, since the gene levels across the cells become comparable. Note, that the differences from scaling etc. are not the values you have at the end - i.e. if your cell has average GAPDH levels, it will not appear as a '0' when you calculate gene differences between clusters.

{% icon congratulations %} Congratulations! You have processed your object!

# Preparing coordinates

We still have too many dimensions. Transcript changes are not usually singular - which is to say, genes were in pathways and in groups. It would be easier to analyse our data if we could more easily group these changes.

## Principal components
Principal components are calculated from highly dimensional data to find the most spread in the dataset. So in our, `3248` highly variable gene dimensions, there will be one line (axis) that yields the most spread and variation across the cells. That will be our first principal component. We can calculate the first `x` principal components in our data to drastically reduce the number of dimensions.

> <comment-title>3248???</comment-title>
> Where did the `3248` come from? The quickest way to figure out how many highly variable genes you have, in my opinion, is to re-run {% icon galaxy-refresh %} the **Scanpy FindVariableGenes** tool and select the parameter to *Remove genes not marked as highly variable*. Then you can Inspect your resulting object and you'll see only 3248 genes. The following processing steps will use only the highly variable genes for their calculations, but I strongly suggest you keep even the nonvariable genes in (i.e., use the original output of your FindVariableGenes tool with way more than 3248 genes!), as a general rule. This tutorial will not work at the end plotting stage if you only take forward the 3248 or 2000 (if you set a limit on it) highly variable genes.

Why 50 principal components you ask? Well, we're pretty confident 50 is an over-estimate. Examine `PCA Variance`.

![PCA-variance](../../images/scrna-casestudy/wab-pcavariance.png "Variability explained per PC")

We can see that there is really not much variation explained past component 19. So we might save ourselves a great deal of time and muddied data by focusing on the top `20` PCs.

## Neighborhood graph

We're still looking at around 20 dimensions at this point. We need to identify how similar a cell is to another cell, across every cell across these dimensions. For this, we will use the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) graph, to identify which cells are close together and which are not. The kNN graph plots connections between cells if their distance (when plotted in this 20 dimensional space!) is amonst the k-th smallest distances from that cell to other cells. This will be crucial for identifying clusters, and is necessary for plotting a UMAP. From [UMAP developers](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap): "Larger neighbor values will result in more global structure being preserved at the loss of detailed local structure. In general this parameter should often be in the range 5 to 50, with a choice of 10 to 15 being a sensible default".

## Dimensionality reduction for visualisation

Two major visualisations for this data are tSNE and UMAP. We must calculate the coordinates for both prior to visualisation. For tSNE, the parameter [**perplexity**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13056-x) can be changed to best represent the data, while for UMAP the main change would be to change the kNN graph above itself, by changing the **neighbours**.

How does this affect the developing cells, and what genes drive this? So let's add in information about cell clusters and gene markers!

Finally, let's identify clusters! Unfortunately, it's not as majestic as biologists often think - the maths doesn't necessarily identify true cell clusters. Every algorithm for identifying cell clusters falls short of a biologist knowing their data, knowing what cells should be there, and proving it in the lab. Sigh. So, we're going to make the best of it as a starting point and see what happens! We will define clusters from the kNN graph, based on how many connections cells have with one another. Roughly, this will depend on a **resolution** parameter for how granular you want to be.

# Plotting!

It's time! Let's plot it all!
But first, let's pick some marker genes from the `Markers-cluster` list that you made as well. I'll be honest, in practice, you'd now be spending a lot of time looking up what each gene does (thank you google!). There are burgeoning automated-annotation tools, however, so long as you have a good reference (a well annotated dataset that you'll use as the ideal). In the mean time, let's do this the old-fashioned way, and just copy a bunch of the markers in the original paper.

# Insights into the beyond

Now it's the fun bit! We can see where genes are expressed, and start considering and interpreting the biology of it. At this point, it's really about what information you want to get from your data - the following is only the tip of the iceberg. However, a brief exploration is good, because it may help give you ideas going forward with for your own data. Let us start interrogating our data!

Note that the cluster numbering is based on size alone - clusters 0 and 1 are not necessarily related, they are just the clusters containing the most cells. It would be nice to know what exactly these cells are. This analysis (googling all of the marker genes, both checking where the ones you know are as well as going through the marker tables you generated!) is a fun task for any individual experiment, so we're going to speed past that and nab the assessment from the original paper!

| Clusters | Marker | Cell type |
|------ |--------------------|
| 4 | Il2ra    | Double negative (early T-cell)    |
| 0,1,2,6 | Cd8b1, Cd8a, Cd4    | Double positive (middle T-cell)|
| 5 | Cd8b1, Cd8a, Cd4 - high | Double positive (late middle T-cell)
| 3 | Itm2a    | Mature T-cell
| 7 | Aif1    | Macrophages    |

![Marker Gene UMAPs](../../images/scrna-casestudy/wab-markergeneumaps.png "Known marker gene locations")

The authors weren't interested in further annotation of the DP cells, so neither are we. Sometimes that just happens. The maths tries to call similar (ish) sized clusters, whether it is biologically relevant or not. Or, the question being asked doesn't really require such granularity of clusters.

> <details-title>Working in a group? Important!</details-title>
> If you have deviated from any of the original parameters in this tutorial, you will likely have a different number of clusters. You will, therefore, need to change the 'Annotating clusters' *"Comma-separated list of new categories"* accordingly. Best of luck!

Perhaps there is some sort of inhibition here? INTERESTING! What next? We might look further at the transcripts present in both those populations, and perhaps also look at the genotype marker table... So much to investigate! But before we set you off to explore to your heart's delight, let's also look at this a bit more technically.

## Technical Assessment

Is our analysis real? Is it right? Well, we can assess that a little bit.

> <question-title>Batch effect</question-title>
>
> Is there a batch effect?
>
> ![Batch effect](../../images/scrna-casestudy/wab-batcheffect.png "Batch effect?")
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> >
> > While some shifts are expected and nothing to be concerned about, DP-L looks to be mainly comprised of N705. There might be a bit of batch effect, so you could consider using batch correction on this dataset. However, if we focus our attention on the other cluster - mature T-cells -  where there is batch mixing, we can still assess this biologically even without batch correction.

> > ![Sex effect](../../images/scrna-casestudy/wab-sex-batch.png "Sex differences")
> >
> > We note that the one female sample - unfortunately one of the mere three knockout samples - seems to be distributed in the same areas as the knockout samples at large, so luckily, this doesn't seem to be a confounding factor and we can still learn from our data. Ideally, this experiment would be re-run with either more female samples all around or swapping out this female from the male sample.

> <question-title>Depth effect</question-title>
>
> Are there any clusters or differences being driven by sequencing depth, a technical and random factor?
>
> ![Sequencing depth](../../images/scrna-casestudy/wab-umap-totalcounts.png "Counts across clusters")
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> >
> > Eureka! This explains the odd DP shift between wildtype and knockout cells - the left side of the DP cells simply have a higher sequencing depth (UMIs/cell) than the ones on the right side. Well, that explains some of the sub-cluster that we're seeing in that splurge. Importantly, we don't see that the DP-L or (mostly) the mature T-cell clusters are similarly affected. So, whilst again, this variable of sequencing depth might be something to regress out somehow, it doesn't seem to be impacting our dataset. The less you can regress/modify your data, in general, the better - you want to stay as true as you can to the raw data, and only use maths to correct your data when you really need to (and not to create insights where there are none!).

> > We have seen in the previous images that these clusters are not very tight or distinct, so we could consider stronger filtering. Additionally, hemoglobin - a red blood cell marker that should NOT be found in T-cells - appears throughout the entire sample in low numbers. This suggests some background in the media the cells were in, and we might consider in the wet lab trying to get a purer, happier sample, or in the dry lab, techniques such as SoupX or others to remove this background. Playing with filtering settings (increasing minimum counts/cell, etc.) is often the place to start in these scenarios.

But looking at the biology here, we struggled to find marker genes to distinguish the DP population, which we know is also affected by depth of sequencing. That's a reasonable argument that DP-M1, DP-M2, and DP-M3 might not be all that different. Maybe we need more depth of sequencing across all the DP cells, or to compare these explicitly to each other (consider variations on FindMarkers!). However, DP-L is both seemingly leaving the DP cluster and also has fewer knockout cells, so we might go and look at what DP-L is expressing in the marker genes. If we look at T-mat further, we can see that its marker gene - Itm2a - is only expressed in half of the cluster. You might consider sub-clustering this to investigate further, either through changing the resolution or through analysing this cluster alone.
> > If we look at the differences between genotypes alone (so the pseudo-bulk), we can see that most of the genes in that list are actually ribosomal. This might be a housekeeping background, this might be cell cycle related, this might be biological, or all three. You might consider investigating the cycling status of the cells, or even regressing this out (which is what the authors did).

Ultimately, there are quite a lot ways to analyse the data, both within the confines of this tutorial (the many parameters that could be changed throughout) and outside of it (batch correction, sub-clustering, cell-cycle scoring, inferred trajectories, etc.) Most analyses will still yield the same general output, though: there are fewer knockout cells in the mature T-cell population.

{% icon congratulations %} Congratulations! You have interpreted your plots in several important ways!

# Interactive visualisations

Before we leave you to explore the unknown, you might have noticed that the above interpretations are only a few of the possible options. Plus you might have had fun trying to figure out which sample is which genotype is which sex and flicking back and forth between plots repeatedly. Figuring out which plots will be your *final publishable* plots takes a lot of time and testing. Luckily, there is a helpful interactive viewer {% cite Cakir2020 %} export tool {% cite Moreno2020.04.08.032698 %} that can help you explore without having to produce new plots over and over!

Be warned - this visualisation tool is a powerful option for exploring your data, but it takes some time to get used to. Consider exploring it as your own tutorial for another day!

# Conclusion


> <details-title>Working in a group? The finale!</details-title>
> Hopefully, no matter which pathway of analysis you took, you found the same general interpretations. If not, this is a good time to discuss and consider with your group why that might be - what decision was 'wrong' or 'ill-advised', and how would you go about ensuring you correctly interpreted your data in the future? Top tip - trial and error is a good idea, believe it or not, and the more ways you find the same insight, the more confident you can be! But nothing beats experimental validation...

{% icon congratulations %} Congratulations! You've made it to the end! You might find this [example control history](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/h/cs3filter-plot-and-explore-single-cell-rna-seq-data---answer-key-2) helpful to compare with, or this [workflow](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/w/cs3filter-plot-and-explore-single-cell-rna-seq-data).

In this tutorial, you moved from technical processing to biological exploration. By analysing real data - both the exciting and the messy! - you have, hopefully, experienced what it's like to analyse and question a dataset, potentially without clear cut-offs or clear answers. If you were working in a group, you each analysed the data in different ways, and most likely found similar insights. One of the biggest problems in analysing scRNA-seq is the lack of a clearly defined pathway or parameters. You have to make the best call you can as you move through your analysis, and ultimately, when in doubt, try it multiple ways and see what happens!
