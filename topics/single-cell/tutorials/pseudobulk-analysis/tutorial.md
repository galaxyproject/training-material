Pseudobulk analysis is a powerful technique that bridges the gap between single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data. It involves aggregating gene expression data from groups of cells within the same biological replicate, such as a mouse or patient, typically based on clustering or cell type annotations ({% cite Murphy2022 %}).

A key advantage of this approach in differential expression analysis is that it avoids treating individual cells as independent samples, which can underestimate variance and lead to inflated significance or overly optimistic p-values ({% cite Squair2021 %}). This occurs because cells from the same biological replicate are inherently more similar to each other than cells from different samples. By grouping data into pseudobulk samples, the analysis aligns with the experimental design, as in bulk RNA-seq, leading to more reliable and robust statistical results ({% cite Murphy2022 %}).

Beyond enhancing statistical validity, pseudobulk analysis enables the identification of cell-type-specific gene expression and functional changes across biological conditions. It balances the detailed resolution of single-cell data with the statistical power of bulk RNA-seq, providing insights into the functional transcriptomic landscape relevant to biological questions. Overall, for differential expression analysis in multi-sample single-cell experiments, pseudo-bulk approaches demonstrate superior performance compared to single-cell-specific DE methods (citation). 

In this tutorial, we will guide you through a pseudobulk analysis workflow using the **Decoupler** and **edgeR** tools available in Galaxy ({% Badia-iMompel2022 %}) ({% Liu2015 %}). These tools facilitate functional and differential expression analysis, and their output can be integrated with other Galaxy tools to visualize results, such as creating Volcano Plots, which we will also cover in this tutorial.

# Let's Get the Data!

## Overview of the Data

Our data was extracted from the publication titled _"Elevated Calprotectin and Abnormal Myeloid Cell Subsets Discriminate Severe from Mild COVID-19"_ ({% cite Silvin2020 %}). This dataset was chosen because it was utilized by the developers of the `decoupler` tool for pseudobulk aggregate analysis ({% decoupler-pseudobulk %}).

Pseudobulk analysis is an advanced method in single-cell data analysis. For this tutorial, we assume familiarity with common single-cell data formats, such as AnnData or Seurat objects, and experience analyzing single-cell data, including clustering and annotating cell types.

If you're new to these concepts, we recommend exploring our other tutorials before going for pseudobulk:
- [Clustering 3K PBMCs with Scanpy](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-scanpy-pbmc3k/tutorial.html): Learn how to cluster and annotate cells in Galaxy using our single-cell tools.
- [Combining single cell datasets after pre-processing](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_alevin-combine-datasets/tutorial.html): Understand how to combine multiple datasets into one AnnData object and add metadata from single-cell experiments.

The data object, which you will import from Zenodo into Galaxy via the provided link, has been preprocessed, analysed, and annotated. It includes the following key observations:
- **cell_type**: The type of cell identified.
- **disease**: Indicates whether the sample is a control or corresponds to a COVID-19 condition.
- **individual**: The individual donor or sample identifier.
- **sex**: The sex of the individual.

# Generation of the Pseudobulk Count Matrix with Decoupler

In this step, our goal is to perform a "bioinformatic cell sorting" based on the annotated clusters of the single-cell data.

To start a pseudobulk analysis, ensure that the AnnData object you will use contains all the necessary metadata for ***"pseudobulking"***. For example, key annotations, such as cell type, condition, disease, and batch, should be present. Most importantly, the AnnData object has to include a layer with the raw counts of gene expression.

Raw counts are crucial for generating accurate pseudobulk aggregates. Since single-cell data is typically normalized after annotation, itâ€™s important to preserve the raw counts in the AnnData object before normalization steps if you would like to perform a pseudobulk analysis later on. These raw counts are directly used by tools like **Decoupler** to generate the pseudobulk count matrix. Note that normalized count matrices should not be used with Decoupler, even if the tool appears to process them successfully.

> <tip-title> Missing Raw Counts? </tip-title>
>
> If your AnnData object lacks raw counts, you can use the **[AnnData Operations](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/ebi-gxa/anndata_ops/anndata_ops/1.9.3+galaxy0)** tool on the **[Single Cell Galaxy instance](https://singlecell.usegalaxy.eu)**. This tool allows you to copy the `.X` matrix into a new layer, such as `counts` or `raw_counts`, making it accessible as an input parameter for Decoupler.
>
> Importantly, ensure that the copying of this matrix as a raw counts layer is done carefully and correctly. To verify that your AnnData object contains the necessary raw counts layer, you can use the **[Inspect AnnData Object](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/anndata_inspect/anndata_inspect/0.10.9+galaxy0)** tool. This tool helps confirm the presence of raw counts and other essential metadata in your AnnData object before proceeding with pseudobulk analysis.

## Sanitation Steps - Part 2

After performing the differential expression analysis with edgeR, we will clean the data to prepare it for visualization. This involves extracting collection elements, removing unnecessary columns, standardizing text, and splitting the file if needed. We will use the {% tool [Extract element identifiers](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/collection_element_identifiers/collection_element_identifiers/0.0.2) %}, [Remove columns](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/column_remove_by_header/column_remove_by_header/1.0) %}, {% tool [Replace Text](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/text_processing/tp_replace_in_line/9.3+galaxy1) %}, {% tool [Split file](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/split_file_to_collection/split_file_to_collection/0.5.2) %}, and {% tool [Parse parameter value](param_value_from_file) %}

# Volcano Plot

In this step, we will use the sanitized output from the previous steps to create a **Volcano Plot**. This plot helps visualize the relationship between statistical significance (P-value) and fold change (LogFC) for differentially expressed genes (DEG).

## What are the results of the Volcano Plot?

Lets take a moment to interpret the Volcano Plot:
- Which genes are most significant?
- How does the fold change correlate with the P-values?
- Are there any unexpected patterns?

# Subsetting Samples from Our Original Pseudobulk Count Matrix

In our previous analysis, we found that only one gene, **MTND1P23**, was identified as downregulated in our contrast. This result was obtained by "bulking" **all** cell types from our dataset and performing a differential expression analysis comparing normal vs. COVID-19 samples.

But what if we refine our approach? For instance, instead of analyzing all cell types together, what happens if we focus on a specific cluster, such as **T cells**, and perform the same comparisonâ€”normal vs. COVID-19? Would the results remain the same, or would this more targeted approach reveal additional insights?

Let's perform this analysis step-by-step
