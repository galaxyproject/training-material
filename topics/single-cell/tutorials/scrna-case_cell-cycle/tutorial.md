Single-cell RNA sequencing can be sensitive to both biological and technical variation, which is why preparing your data carefully is an important part of the analysis. You want the results to reflect the interesting differences in expression between cells that relate to their type or state. Other sources of variation can conceal or confound this, making it harder for you to see what is going on.

One common biological confounder is the cell cycle ({% cite Luecken2019 %}). Cells express different genes during different parts of the cell cycle, depending on whether they are in their growing phase (G1), duplicating their DNA (the S or Synthesis phase), or dividing in two (G2/M or Mitosis phase). If these cell cycle genes are having a big impact on your data, then you could end up with separate clusters that actually represent cells of the same type that are just at different stages of the cycle.

In this tutorial, we will identify the genes whose expression is known to vary during the cell cycle so that we can use them to regress out (or remove) the effects of the cell cycle on the clustering.

## Get Data

The data used in this tutorial is from a mouse dataset of fetal growth restriction ({% cite Bacon2018 %}). Cell cycle regression should be performed after the data has been filtered, normalised, and scaled. You can download the dataset below or import the history with the starting data.

> <comment-title></comment-title>
> - If you've been working through the Single-cell RNA-seq: Case Study then you can use your dataset from the [Filter, Plot and Explore Single-cell RNA-seq Data]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_basic-pipeline/tutorial.md %}) tutorial here. Select the `Use_me_Scaled` dataset from your history. Rename that dataset as `Processed_Anndata`. You will still need to import the S and G2/M gene lists below through Zenodo.
> - At the end of this tutorial, you can return to the main tutorial to plot and explore your data with reduced effects from the cell cycle.
{: .comment}

In addition to the scRNA-seq dataset, we will also need lists of the genes that are known to be expressed at different points in the cell cycle. The lists used in this tutorial are part of the HBC tinyatlas and can be downloaded from Zenodo below {% cite kirchner_hbc_2018 %}. Between them, they include 97 genes that are expressed during the S and G2/M phases. The expression level of these cycle genes are - mostly - determined by the phases of the cell cycle. Make sure that the file type is tabular (not just the name of the file) - you can choose this when you download the files or change it after the files are in your history.

# Cell Cycle Scoring

The first step towards reducing the effects of the cell cycle on our dataset is cell cycle scoring. The cell cycle scoring algorithm will look at each cell in turn and calculate an S score based on the difference in the mean expression of the S Phase genes and a random sample of the same number of non-cell cycle genes from the same cell. It will do the same for the G2M genes in order to calculate the G2M score. The cells will then be assigned to the most likely phase: S, G2M, or G1, if neither G2M or S score highly. Three columns will be added to the AnnData dataset: `S_score`, `G2M_score` and `phase`.

> >
> > 1. Since we know which genes are expressed in the S and G2/M phases, we can classify cells that are expressing these genes into the S and G2/M phases respectively. Cells that aren't expressing either the S or G2/M genes must be in the other phase of the cell cycle, so we can classify them as in G1 phase.

> <comment-title>When should we regress out the effects of the cell cycle?</comment-title>
>  Cell cycle regression can be particularly important if we are planning to do trajectory analysis down the line or if we have a dataset that is very strongly influenced by the cell cycle {% cite Luecken2019 %}. However, it isn't always appropriate to remove the effects of the cell cycle - sometimes they can be useful for distinguishing between dividing and non-dividing cell types. When you are analysing your own data, you might need to try it both ways to determine if the effects of the cell cycle are helpful or not. You could also check whether the cell cycle genes are among the top scoring genes expressed by your cell clusters to get an idea of how strong the effects are.

# Cell Cycle Regression

The second step after scoring the cell cycle genes is to use these scores to regress out the effects of the cell cycle. Now that we know which phase each of our cells is in, we can work out how this is affecting gene expression in our cells. We can subtract these effects from our data so that they won't influence our cell clustering. You will need to type the `phase` variable in to the {% tool Scanpy RegressOut %} tool to enable it to regress out the cell cycle effects.

> <details-title>How does cell cycle regression work?</details-title>
>
>The {% tool Scanpy RegressOut %} tool will create a linear model of the relationship between gene expression and the cell cycle scores we assigned in the previous step. Basically, this model is a line that shows how gene expression changes as the S or G2M score changes. Each gene will have its own line, so for any S score or G2M score, we could look at the corresponding point on the line to see the expected expression level of that gene.
>
>{% tool Scanpy RegressOut %} will then regress out or remove this expected effect for the genes expressed by each cell, according to the cell's S and G2M scores. The expected effect is subtracted from the expression data, leaving behind the difference between the expected position on the line and the actual position of each data point. The data points won't sit exactly on the line because their expression levels aren't determined completely by the cell cycle - the linear model only tells us what we would expect based on the cell cycle scores alone.
>
> Understanding how the regression works should help you to see why we're not just deleting the cell cycle genes from the dataset. We are using these genes that are known to be expressed during different phases to calculate the cell cycle scores and determine the phase each cell is in. We then use this information to work out the effect of the cell cycle on all of the other genes expressed by the cells. Even if they are not cell cycle genes, their expression can still be affected by the cycle. Finally, we remove or regress out the effect of the cell cycle on all the genes, leaving behind the variation that we're interested in.

# Plotting the Effects of Cell Cycle Regression

Your data is now ready for further analysis, so you can return to the [Filter, Plot and Explore Single-cell RNA-seq Data]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_basic-pipeline/tutorial.md %}) tutorial and move on to the Preparing coordinates step there. Make sure that you use the `CellCycle_Regressed` dataset (you may want to rename it as `Use_me_Scaled` as that is the name used in the main tutorial). However, if you want to understand how cell cycle regression has affected your data then you can work through the following steps first, to visualise where the cell cycle genes are expressed - with or without regression.

In order to look at the cell cycle genes, we first need to label them in our AnnData dataset so that we can select them for plotting. To add a new annotation to the genes or variables, we need a column with entries for each gene, in the same order as in the dataset, and with a header at the top that will become the key for identifying these entries in the AnnData dataset. We want to end up with a column that reads `TRUE` for the 97 cell cycle genes and `FALSE` for all the other genes.

You might find it easier to create this new column using a spreadsheet and then upload it as a tabular dataset, but it is possible to complete all the steps on Galaxy.

## Prepare a table of cell cycle genes

If we're going to mark all the cell cycle genes, we'll need a single list of all 97 genes instead of the two separate lists for S Phase and G2/M Phase. We'll combine the two lists into a single column with 97 entries. We'll then add a second column that simply reads `TRUE` in every row, which we'll use later to mark these as cell cycle genes in the main dataset.

{: .hands_on}

## Create an ordered list of gene names

Next, we'll need a list of all the genes in our dataset, so that we can mark the ones that are in our cell cycle list. We'll also add a column of numbers as this will help us keep the gene names in order.

The cell cycle gene table has an extra column where they are all marked as `TRUE` - they will retain these entries when we join the tables, but since there are no entries for the rest of the genes in this column, their rows will be filled in as `FALSE`. This will enable us to pick out the cell cycle genes later.

## Create the annotation column

We now have a table with all the gene names in the same order as the main dataset and a column indicating which ones are cell cycle genes. If we cut this column out of the table, then we can add it as a new annotation to the main dataset. We'll also need to add a column header, which will be used as the key for this annotation in the AnnData dataset.

## Add an annotation to the AnnData

We will need to add the annotation to both the annotated dataset `CellCycle_Annotated` and to the one that we created by regressing out the cell cycle genes `CellCycle_Regressed`. This will allow us to plot the cell cycle genes before and after regression. We can do this using the {% tool Manipulate Anndata %} tool and selecting the correct function from the dropdown menu.

## Filter the cell cycle genes

To demonstrate the power of cell cycle regression, we're going to reduce our expression matrices to contain only the 97 cell cycle genes. This will force our dimension reduction and plotting to be based entirely on cell cycle genes. You wouldn't do this during analysis, but for proof of principle, let's go for it!

## Plot the cell cycle genes before regression

Now that we have a dataset that only includes the cell cycle genes, we can visualise their effects in a PCA plot. We first calculate the PCA coordinates, which are a measure of how similar each pair of cells is in terms of the expression of the 97 cell cycle genes we've included in the filtered dataset. We will then visualise the cells on a PCA plot where the axes represent the principal components, which reflect the genes (or groups of genes) that had the biggest impact in these calculations.

You will learn more about plotting your data in the [Filter, Plot and Explore]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_basic-pipeline/tutorial.md %}) tutorial. For now, it is enough to know that each dot on the plot represents a cell and the closer two cells are together, the more similar they are.

We will now repeat the same steps to create a PCA plot of the filtered dataset after the effects of the cell cycle have been regressed out.

This makes sense because we are only plotting the cell cycle genes, but the previously strong effects of the cell cycle on these genes have now been regressed out. There are still some differences between the cells (they don't all end up at the same point on the PCA chart) because the regression only removes the expected effects of the cell cycle, leaving behind any individual variation in the expression of the cell cycle genes.

Comparing the before and after plots, we can clearly see that the effects of the cell cycle have been removed. Although you wouldn't usually need to filter out the cell cycle genes or create these plots when analysing your own data, hopefully you have found doing it now to be helpful for understanding the impact of cell cycle regression.

Although the cell cycle genes can have a significant effect, these won't be as obvious when other genes are also being taken into account. However, we will still see a difference after we regress out the effects of the cell cycle - the cells in different phases will become more mixed up together. How much of a difference the regression makes will depend on how strong the effects of the cell cycle are in a particular dataset - you can see the effects on this dataset below. You can also replicate these plots after completing the rest of the [Filter, Plot and Explore]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_basic-pipeline/tutorial.md %}) tutorial by colouring your PCA plots by phase.

# Conclusion

In this tutorial, you have annotated and scored the cell cycle genes and regressed out the effects of the cell cycle. You have also created PCA plots of the data before and after regression to visualise the effects.

You might want to check your results against this [example history](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/marisa_jl/h/removing-the-effects-of-the-cell-cycle---answer-key).

You can now continue to analyse this data by returning to the Preparing coordinates step in the [Filter, Plot and Explore]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_basic-pipeline/tutorial.md %}) tutorial. If you use the `CellCycle_Regressed` dataset (which you may now want to rename as `Use_me_Scaled` since that is the name used in the main tutorial), you should notice some differences in your results compared to those shown there because the effects of the cell cycle have been regressed out.
