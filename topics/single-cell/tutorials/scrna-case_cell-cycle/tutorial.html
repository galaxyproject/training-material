                <p>Single-cell RNA sequencing can be sensitive to both biological and technical variation, which is why preparing your data carefully is an important part of the analysis. You want the results to reflect the interesting differences in expression between cells that relate to their type or state. Other sources of variation can conceal or confound this, making it harder for you to see what is going on.</p>

<p>One common biological confounder is the cell cycle (<span class="citation"><a href="#Luecken2019">Luecken and Theis 2019</a></span>). Cells express different genes during different parts of the cell cycle, depending on whether they are in their growing phase (G1), duplicating their DNA (the S or Synthesis phase), or dividing in two (G2/M or Mitosis phase). If these cell cycle genes are having a big impact on your data, then you could end up with separate clusters that actually represent cells of the same type that are just at different stages of the cycle.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will identify the genes whose expression is known to vary during the cell cycle so that we can use them to regress out (or remove) the effects of the cell cycle on the clustering.</p>

  <p>This tutorial is based on the Scanpy cell cycle regression tutorial (<span class="citation"><a href="#ScanpyCC">Cittaro 2018</a></span>), which was itself based on the Seurat vignette addressing the same issue (<span class="citation"><a href="#SeuratCC">Paul Hoffman 2022</a></span>). However, we will be using a different dataset for this tutorial.</p>

<h2 id="get-data">Get Data</h2>

<p>The data used in this tutorial is from a mouse dataset of fetal growth restriction (<span class="citation"><a href="#Bacon2018">Bacon <i>et al.</i> 2018</a></span>). Cell cycle regression should be performed after the data has been filtered, normalised, and scaled. You can download the dataset below or import the history with the starting data.</p>

Rename that dataset as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Processed_Anndata</code>. You will still need to import the S and G2/M gene lists below through Zenodo.</li>
    <li>At the end of this tutorial, you can return to the main tutorial to plot and explore your data with reduced effects from the cell cycle.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to the scRNA-seq dataset, we will also need lists of the genes that are known to be expressed at different points in the cell cycle. The lists used in this tutorial are part of the HBC tinyatlas and can be downloaded from Zenodo below <span class="citation"><a href="#kirchner_hbc_2018">Kirchner and HBC 2018</a></span>. Between them, they include 97 genes that are expressed during the S and G2/M phases. The expression level of these cycle genes are - mostly - determined by the phases of the cell cycle. Make sure that the file type is tabular (not just the name of the file) - you can choose this when you download the files or change it after the files are in your history.</p>

<h1 id="cell-cycle-scoring">Cell Cycle Scoring</h1>

<p>The first step towards reducing the effects of the cell cycle on our dataset is cell cycle scoring. The cell cycle scoring algorithm will look at each cell in turn and calculate an S score based on the difference in the mean expression of the S Phase genes and a random sample of the same number of non-cell cycle genes from the same cell. It will do the same for the G2M genes in order to calculate the G2M score. The cells will then be assigned to the most likely phase: S, G2M, or G1, if neither G2M or S score highly. Three columns will be added to the AnnData dataset: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S_score</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">G2M_score</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">phase</code>.</p>

  <p>Cell cycle regression can be particularly important if we are planning to do trajectory analysis down the line or if we have a dataset that is very strongly influenced by the cell cycle <span class="citation"><a href="#Luecken2019">Luecken and Theis 2019</a></span>. However, it isn’t always appropriate to remove the effects of the cell cycle - sometimes they can be useful for distinguishing between dividing and non-dividing cell types. When you are analysing your own data, you might need to try it both ways to determine if the effects of the cell cycle are helpful or not. You could also check whether the cell cycle genes are among the top scoring genes expressed by your cell clusters to get an idea of how strong the effects are.</p>

<h1 id="cell-cycle-regression">Cell Cycle Regression</h1>

<p>The second step after scoring the cell cycle genes is to use these scores to regress out the effects of the cell cycle. Now that we know which phase each of our cells is in, we can work out how this is affecting gene expression in our cells. We can subtract these effects from our data so that they won’t influence our cell clustering. You will need to type the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">phase</code> variable in to the <span><strong>Scanpy RegressOut</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> tool to enable it to regress out the cell cycle effects.</p>

<blockquote class="details">
  <div class="box-title details-title" id="details-how-does-cell-cycle-regression-work"><button class="gtn-boxify-button details" type="button" aria-controls="details-how-does-cell-cycle-regression-work" aria-expanded="true"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Details: How does cell cycle regression work?</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p>The <span><strong>Scanpy RegressOut</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> tool will create a linear model of the relationship between gene expression and the cell cycle scores we assigned in the previous step. Basically, this model is a line that shows how gene expression changes as the S or G2M score changes. Each gene will have its own line, so for any S score or G2M score, we could look at the corresponding point on the line to see the expected expression level of that gene.</p>

  <p><span><strong>Scanpy RegressOut</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> will then regress out or remove this expected effect for the genes expressed by each cell, according to the cell’s S and G2M scores. The expected effect is subtracted from the expression data, leaving behind the difference between the expected position on the line and the actual position of each data point. The data points won’t sit exactly on the line because their expression levels aren’t determined completely by the cell cycle - the linear model only tells us what we would expect based on the cell cycle scores alone.</p>

  <p>Understanding how the regression works should help you to see why we’re not just deleting the cell cycle genes from the dataset. We are using these genes that are known to be expressed during different phases to calculate the cell cycle scores and determine the phase each cell is in. We then use this information to work out the effect of the cell cycle on all of the other genes expressed by the cells. Even if they are not cell cycle genes, their expression can still be affected by the cycle. Finally, we remove or regress out the effect of the cell cycle on all the genes, leaving behind the variation that we’re interested in.</p>

<h1 id="plotting-the-effects-of-cell-cycle-regression">Plotting the Effects of Cell Cycle Regression</h1>

<p>Your data is now ready for further analysis, so you can return to the <a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_basic-pipeline/tutorial.html">Filter, Plot and Explore Single-cell RNA-seq Data</a> tutorial and move on to the Preparing coordinates step there. Make sure that you use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CellCycle_Regressed</code> dataset (you may want to rename it as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Use_me_Scaled</code> as that is the name used in the main tutorial). However, if you want to understand how cell cycle regression has affected your data then you can work through the following steps first, to visualise where the cell cycle genes are expressed - with or without regression.</p>

<p>In order to look at the cell cycle genes, we first need to label them in our AnnData dataset so that we can select them for plotting. To add a new annotation to the genes or variables, we need a column with entries for each gene, in the same order as in the dataset, and with a header at the top that will become the key for identifying these entries in the AnnData dataset. We want to end up with a column that reads <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TRUE</code> for the 97 cell cycle genes and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FALSE</code> for all the other genes.</p>

<p>You might find it easier to create this new column using a spreadsheet and then upload it as a tabular dataset, but it is possible to complete all the steps on Galaxy.</p>

<h2 id="prepare-a-table-of-cell-cycle-genes">Prepare a table of cell cycle genes</h2>

<p>If we’re going to mark all the cell cycle genes, we’ll need a single list of all 97 genes instead of the two separate lists for S Phase and G2/M Phase. We’ll combine the two lists into a single column with 97 entries. We’ll then add a second column that simply reads <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TRUE</code> in every row, which we’ll use later to mark these as cell cycle genes in the main dataset.</p>

<h2 id="plot-the-cell-cycle-genes-before-regression">Plot the cell cycle genes before regression</h2>

<p>Now that we have a dataset that only includes the cell cycle genes, we can visualise their effects in a PCA plot. We first calculate the PCA coordinates, which are a measure of how similar each pair of cells is in terms of the expression of the 97 cell cycle genes we’ve included in the filtered dataset. We will then visualise the cells on a PCA plot where the axes represent the principal components, which reflect the genes (or groups of genes) that had the biggest impact in these calculations.</p>

<p>You will learn more about plotting your data in the <a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_basic-pipeline/tutorial.html">Filter, Plot and Explore</a> tutorial. For now, it is enough to know that each dot on the plot represents a cell and the closer two cells are together, the more similar they are.</p>

      <li>The cells in different phases are now all mixed up together. This makes sense because we are only plotting the cell cycle genes, but the previously strong effects of the cell cycle on these genes have now been regressed out. There are still some differences between the cells (they don’t all end up at the same point on the PCA chart) because the regression only removes the expected effects of the cell cycle, leaving behind any individual variation in the expression of the cell cycle genes.</li>
    </ol>

<p>Comparing the before and after plots, we can clearly see that the effects of the cell cycle have been removed. Although you wouldn’t usually need to filter out the cell cycle genes or create these plots when analysing your own data, hopefully you have found doing it now to be helpful for understanding the impact of cell cycle regression.</p>

<blockquote class="question">
  <div class="box-title question-title" id="question-4"><i class="far fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Question</div>

  <ol>
    <li>What impact do you think the cell cycle regression will have when you analyse the whole dataset? What would happen if we plotted all of the genes from the main dataset?</li>
  </ol>

  <blockquote class="solution">
    <div class="box-title solution-title" id="solution-4"><button class="gtn-boxify-button solution" type="button" aria-controls="solution-4" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Solution</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

    <ol>
      <li>The regression reduces the impact of the cell cycle on the data - this is why the cells are less separated by phase afterwards. When we analyse the whole <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CellCycle_Regressed</code> dataset, with all of the genes, this could allow other differences in gene expression to become more apparent.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We wouldn’t expect to see such clear distinctions in PCA plots created using all of the genes (not just the cell cycle ones), even before the regression. Although the cell cycle genes can have a significant effect, these won’t be as obvious when other genes are also being taken into account. However, we will still see a difference after we regress out the effects of the cell cycle - the cells in different phases will become more mixed up together. How much of a difference the regression makes will depend on how strong the effects of the cell cycle are in a particular dataset - you can see the effects on this dataset below. You can also replicate these plots after completing the rest of the <a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_basic-pipeline/tutorial.html">Filter, Plot and Explore</a> tutorial by colouring your PCA plots by phase.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In this tutorial, you have annotated and scored the cell cycle genes and regressed out the effects of the cell cycle. You have also created PCA plots of the data before and after regression to visualise the effects.</p>

<p>You might want to check your results against this <a href="https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/marisa_jl/h/removing-the-effects-of-the-cell-cycle---answer-key">example history</a>.</p>

<p>You can now continue to analyse this data by returning to the Preparing coordinates step in the <a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_basic-pipeline/tutorial.html">Filter, Plot and Explore</a> tutorial. If you use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CellCycle_Regressed</code> dataset (which you may now want to rename as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Use_me_Scaled</code> since that is the name used in the main tutorial), you should notice some differences in your results compared to those shown there because the effects of the cell cycle have been regressed out.</p>
