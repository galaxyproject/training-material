<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Let’s start with what the differences are between Bulk RNA-seq and single cell RNA seq data.</li>
  <li>With Bulk RNA-seq we compare two tissues by looking at the average expression of each gene detected across each of the tissues.</li>
  <li>Due to the number of RNA molecules being considered, the sequencing depth and the strength of the analysis is reasonably high.</li>
  <li>The differential expression is then measured as the relative expression of a given gene between one tissue and another.</li>
</ul>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>With single cell RNA-seq analysis, the stage shifts away from measuring the average expression of a tissue.</li>
  <li>And towards measuring the specific gene expression of individual cells within those tissues.</li>
  <li>Here we are no longer comparing tissue against tissue, but cell against cell.</li>
  <li>Each cell is assigned a gene profile which describes the relative abundance of genes detected within it.</li>
  <li>Many cells share the same gene profile, where a gene profile ideally describes a cell type.</li>
  <li>Sometimes we need to compare single-cell datasets across tissues, and we see that many cells across tissues share the same cell type.</li>
  <li>For example, look at the purple and green gene profiles which are shared across both tissues.</li>
</ul>

  <li>The first row of the top table defines the library size, which is total number of messenger RNAs across all genes in each cell.</li>
  <li>The subsequent rows are the thresholds of gene detectability, displaying how many genes are detected in each cell for genes greater than the threshold amounts of 0 to 4.</li>
  <li>We see that even a threshold of greater than 3 transcripts detected in a given cell  still keeps 3 cells in the analysis: B, C, and E. In the lower table, the opposite is represented, with the total number of transcripts across all cells for each gene.</li>

  <li>Filtering can be a luxury however, as many single-cell RNA-seq datasets have typically low sequencing depth compared to bulk RNA-seq.</li>

  <li>This is normally performed by using median values. For example, for DE-Seq normalisation, the geometric mean count for a cell is taken, and each gene value in that cell is divided by it and by the median value of all geometric means of all cells.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Confounding biological variance appears in two forms: Transcriptional bursting, and Cell cycle variation.</li>
  <li>Transcriptional bursting is a phenomenon that occurs in cells in which transcription occurs in discrete states of active and inactive, where the interval between these states is hard to model.</li>
  <li>In bulk RNA-seq, this phenomenon is unnoticeable as the effects are averaged out over many cells. But in single cell, two cells of the same type may exhibit different gene profiles simply because one cell was actively transcribing and the other was not.</li>
  <li>This is not something we can control for in the analysis, but it is something we should be aware of when understanding why cell clusters can be noisy.</li>
  <li>Cell cycle variation on the other hand is a much more well understood process, where the amount of RNA in a cell is approximately double that from a cell of the same type due to one being in the early G1 phase and the other being in the M-phase during the cell cycle.</li>
  <li>There are genes which are known to covary with the cell cycle, and so by regressing the effect of these genes, we can control against the cell cycle.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Once we have removed unwanted confounders from the analysis we have the issue of quantifying the relationships between cells.</li>
  <li>From a data analysis standpoint, we treat each cell as an observation, and each gene as a variable.</li>
  <li>For large genomes this means extremely high dimensional datasets. Cells exist as points in this extremely sparsely populated high dimensional space, making it difficult to see the natural groupings.</li>
  <li>The high dimensional space can be reduced a lot by simply filtering out genes that do not appear to be differentially expressed across all cells.</li>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Louvain clustering is a widely used type of community clustering for single cell data.</li>
  <li>Here each cell is assigned a neighbourhood of its own and the number of internal and external links between neighbourhoods are counted.</li>
  <li>For each iteration, a random cell is selected and brought within the neighbourhood of another cell, and the internal and external links are once again counted.</li>
  <li>If the new configuration has reduced the number of external links in favour of more internal links, then the configuration is kept.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span>
If the new configuration has instead increased the number of external links, then the configuration is rejected and another cell is picked and tested. By performing this multiple times, a community structure of cells is built to whichever degree of specificity the user desires.</p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Single cell analysis is non-trivial, and each stage, from the filtering to the normalisation to the dimension reduction and the clustering can drastically affect the outcome of the analysis.</li>
  <li>Due to the variability in the analysis, one should not panic when faced with uncertainty.</li>
  <li>The goal is to play around with the data until it begins to reflect the biology.</li>
  <li>This can take many many tries to achieve, and it may never be perfect, but the idea is to try as many different ways as possible to see what robust conclusions you can come to.</li>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this regard, the vast UseGalaxy resources can be put to good use by testing out the many different paths of the analysis, and the Galaxy Training Network provides tutorials and hands-on trainings to assist you in this regard.</li>
  <li>Please explore them to better develop your understanding.</li>

<h2>Key Points</h2>

<ul>

<li>scRNA-seq requires much pre-processing before analysis can be performed.</li>

<li>Groups of similarly profiled-cells are compared against other groups.</li>

<li>Detectability issues requires careful consideration at all stages.</li>

<li>Clustering is an integral part of an analysis.</li>

</ul>
