# What is a convolutional neural network (CNN)?

???

What is a convolutional neural network (CNN)?

---

# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- Increasing popularity of social media in past decade
	- Image and video processing tasks have become very important
- FNN could not scale up to image and video processing tasks
- CNN specifically tailored for image and video processing tasks

---

# Feedforward neural networks (FNN)

- In FNN all nodes in a layer connected to all nodes in next layer
	- Each connection has a weight, must be learned by learning algorithm

![Neurons forming the input, output, and hidden layers of a multi-layer feedforward neural network](/training-material/topics/statistics/images/FFNN.png) &lt;!-- https://pixy.org/3013900/ CC0 license--&gt;

---

# Limitations of FNN

- If input is 64 pixel by 64 pixel grayscale image
	- Each grayscale pixel represented by 1 value, usually between 0 to 255
	- Where 0 is black, 255 is white, and values in between are shades of gray
- Since each grayscale pixel represented by 1 value, we say *channel* size is 1
- Image represented by 64 x 64 x 1 = 4,096 values (rows x columns x channels)
	- Hence, input layer of FNN has 4096 nodes
- Lets assume next layer has 500 nodes
	- Since FNN fully connected, we have 4,096 x 500 = 2,048,000 weights

---

# Limitations of FNN

- For complex problems, we need multiple hidden layers in our FNN
	- Compunds the problem of having many weights
- Having too many weights
	- Makes learning more difficult as dimension of search space is increased
	- Makes training more time/resource consuming
	- Increases the likelihood of overfitting

- Problem is further compunded for color images
	- Each pixel in color image represented by 3 values (RGB color mode)
	- Since each pixel represented by 3 values, we say *channel* size is 3
	- Image represented by 64 x 64 x 3 = 12,288 values (rows x columns x channels)
	- Number of weights is now 12,288 x 500 = 6,144,000

---

# Limitations of FNN

- Clear that FNN cannot scale to larger images (Too many weights)
- Another problem with FNN
	- 2D image represented as 1D vector in input layer
	- Any spatial relationship in the data is ignored

---

# Inspiration for CNN

- In 1959 Hubel &amp; Wiesel did an experiment to understand how visual cortex of brain processes visual info
	- Recorded activity of neurons in visual cortex of a cat
	- While moving a bright line in front of the cat
- Some cells fired when bright line is shown at a particular angle/location
	- Called these *simple* cells
- Other cells fired when bright line was shown regardless of angle/location
	- Seemed to detect movement
	- Called these *complex* cells
- Seemed complex cells receive inputs from multiple simple cells
	- Have an hierarchical structure
- Hubel and Wiesel won Noble prize in 1981

---

# Inspiration for CNN

- Inspired by complex/simple cells, Fukushima proposed *Neocognitron* (1980)
	- Hierarchical neural network used for handwritten Japanese character recognition
	- First CNN, had its own training algorithm
- In 1989, LeCun proposed CNN that was trained by backpropagation
- CNN got popular when outperformed other models at ImageNet Challenge
	- Competition in object classification/detection
	- On hundreds of object categories and millions of images
	- Run annually from 2010 to present
- Notable CNN architectures that won ImageNet challenge
	- AlexNet (2012), ZFNet (2013), GoogLeNet &amp; VGG (2014), ResNet (2015)

---

# Architecture of CNN

- A typical CNN has 4 layers
	- Input layer
	- Convolution layer
	- Pooling layer
	- Fully connected layer

- We will explain a 2D CNN here
	- Same concepts apply to a 1 (or 3) dimensional CNN

---

# Input layer

- Example input a 28 pixel by 28 pixel grayscale image
- Unlike FNN, we do not “flatten” the input to a 1D vector
	- Input is presented to network in 2D as 28 x 28 matrix
	- This makes capturing spatial relationships easier

---

# Convolution layer

- Composed of multiple filters (kernels)
- Filters for 2D image are also 2D
- Suppose we have a 3 by 3 filter (9 values in total)
	- Values are randomly set to 0 or 1
- Convolution: placing 3 by 3 filter on the top left corner of image
	- Multiply filter values by pixel values, add the results
	- Move filter to right one pixel at a time, and repeat this process
	- When at top right corner, move filter down one pixel and repeat process
	- Process ends when we get to bottom right corner of image

---

# 3 by 3 Filter

![A 3 by 3 filter applied to a 4 by 4 image, resulting in a 2 by 2 image](/training-material/topics/statistics/images/Conv_no_padding_no_strides.gif) &lt;!-- https://pixy.org/3013900/ CC0 license--&gt;

---

# Convolution operator parameters

- Filter size
- Padding
- Stride
- Dilation
- Activation function

---

# Filter size

- Filter size can be 5 by 5, 3 by 3, and so on
- Larger filter sizes should be avoided
	- As learning algorithm needs to learn filter values (weights)
- Odd sized filters are preferred to even sized filters
	- Nice geometric property of all input pixels being around output pixel

---

# Padding

- After applying 3 by 3 filter to 4 by 4 image, we get a 2 by 2 image
	– Size of the image has gone down
- If we want to keep image size the same, we can use padding
	- We pad input in every direction with 0’s before applying filter
	- If padding is 1 by 1, then we add 1 zero in evey direction
	- If padding is 2 by 2, then we add 2 zeros in every direction, and so on

---

# 3 by 3 filter with padding of 1

![A 3 by 3 filter applied to a 5 by 5 image, with padding of 1, resulting in a 5 by 5 image](/training-material/topics/statistics/images/Conv_same_padding_no_strides.gif) &lt;!-- https://pixy.org/3013900/ CC0 license--&gt;

---

# Stride

- How many pixels we move filter to the right/down is stride
- Stride 1: move filter one pixel to the right/down
- Stride 2: move filter two pixels to the right/down

---

# 3 by 3 filter with stride of 2

![A 3 by 3 filter applied to a 5 by 5 image, with stride of 2, resulting in a 2 by 2 image](/training-material/topics/statistics/images/Conv_no_padding_strides.gif) &lt;!-- https://pixy.org/3013900/ CC0 license--&gt;

---

# Dilation

- When we apply 3 by 3 filter, output affected by pixels in 3 by 3 subset of image
- Dilation: To have a larger receptive field (portion of image affecting filter’s output)
- If dilation set to 2, instead of contiguous 3 by 3 subset of image, every other pixel of a 5 by 5 subset of image affects output

---

# 3 by 3 filter with dilation of 2

![A 3 by 3 filter applied to a 7 by 7 image, with dilation of 2, resulting in a 3 by 3 image](/training-material/topics/statistics/images/Conv_dilation.gif) &lt;!-- https://pixy.org/3013900/ CC0 license--&gt;

---

# Activation function

- After filter applied to whole image, apply activation function to output to introduce non-linearlity
- Preferred activation function in CNN is ReLU
- ReLU leaves outputs with positive values as is, replaces negative values with 0

---

# Relu activation function

![Two matrices representing filter output before and after ReLU activation function is applied](/training-material/topics/statistics/images/Conv_ReLU.png) &lt;!-- https://pixy.org/3013900/ CC0 license--&gt;

# Single channel 2D convolution

![One matrix representing an input vector and another matrix representing a filter, along with calculation for single input channel two dimensional convolution operation](/training-material/topics/statistics/images/Conv_single_input_channel.png) &lt;!-- https://pixy.org/3013900/ CC0 license--&gt;

---

# Triple channel 2D convolution

![Three matrices representing an input vector and another three matrices representing a filter, along with calculation for multiple input channel two dimensional convolution operation](/training-material/topics/statistics/images/Conv_multiple_input_channel.png) &lt;!-- https://pixy.org/3013900/ CC0 license--&gt;

---

# Triple channel 2D convolution in 3D

![Multiple cubes representing input vector, filter, and output in a 3 channel 2 dimensional convolution operation](/training-material/topics/statistics/images/Conv_multiple_channel_3d.gif) &lt;!-- https://pixy.org/3013900/ CC0 license--&gt;

---

# Change channel size

- Output of a multi-channel 2D filter is a single channel 2D image
- Applying *multiple* filters results in a multi-channel 2D image
- E.g., if input image is 28 x 28 x 3 (rows x columns x channels)
	- We apply a 3 x 3 filter with 1 x 1 padding, we get a 28 x 28 x 1 image
	- If we apply 15 such filters, we get a 28 x 28 x 15
- Number of filters allows us to increase or decrease channel size

---

# Pooling layer

- Pooling layer performs down sampling to reduce spatial dimensionality of input
- This decreases number of parameters
	- Reduces learning time/computation
	- Reduces likelihood of overfitting
- Most popular type is *max* pooling
	- Usually a 2 x 2 filter with a stride of 2 
	- Returns maximum value as it slides over input data

---

# Fully connected layer

- Last layer in a CNN
- Connect all nodes from previous layer to this fully connected layer
	- Which is responsible for classification of the image

---

# An example CNN

![A convolutional neural network with 3 convolution layers followed by 3 pooling layers](/training-material/topics/statistics/images/Conv_CNN.png) &lt;!-- https://pixy.org/3013900/ CC0 license--&gt;

---

# An example CNN

- A typical CNN has several convolution plus pooling layers
	- Each responsible for feature extraction at different levels of abstraction
	- E.g., filters in first layer detect horizontal, vertical, and diagonal edges
	- Filters in the next layer detect shapes
	- Filters in the last layer detect collection of shapes
- Filter values randomly initialized, learned by learning algorithm
- CNN not only do classification, but can also automatically do feature extraction
	- Distinguishes CNN from other classification techniques (like Support Vector Machines)

---

# MNIST dataset

- MNIST dataset of handwritten digits
	- Composed of training set of 60,000 and test set of 10,000 images
- Digits have been size-normalized/centered in a fixed-size image (28 by 28 pixels)
- Images are grayscale
	- Each pixel is represented by a number between 0 and 255

# Classification of MNIST images with CNN

- We define a CNN and train it using MNIST dataset training data
- Goal is to learn a model such that given image of a digit we predict the digit (0 to 9)
- We then evaluate the trained CNN on test dataset and plot the confusion matrix
