                <p>In this tutorial you will learn how to use Galaxy tools to solve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">regression</a> problems. First, we will introduce the concept of regression briefly, and then examine linear regression, which models the relationship between a target variable and some explanatory variables (also known as independent variables). Next, we will discuss gradient boosting regression, an more advanced regressor model which can model nonlinear relationships between variables. Then, we will show how to visualize the results in each step. Finally, we will discuss how to train our models by finding the values of their parameters that minimize a cost function. We will work through a real problem to learn how the models and learning algorithms work.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we will build a regression model for chronological age prediction, based on DNA methylation. This is based on the work of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1872497317301643?via%3Dihub">Jana Naue et al. 2017</a>, in which biomarkers are examined to predict the chronological age of humans by analyzing the DNA methylation patterns. Different machine learning algorithms are used in this study to make an age prediction.</p>

<p>It has been recognized that within each individual, the level of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3174260/">DNA methylation</a> changes with age. This knowledge is used to select useful biomarkers from DNA methylation datasets. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site">CpG sites</a> with the highest correlation to age are selected as the biomarkers (and therefore features for building a regression model).

<h1 id="regression">Regression</h1>

<p>Regression analysis attempts to determine the relationship between one target variable and a series of independent variables. A regressor learns the mapping between the features of a dataset row (i.e. the values for each of the independent variables) and its target value. It tries to fit a curve for the targets, which can be linear or non-linear. When the targets in a dataset are real numbers, the machine learning task is known as regression and each sample in the dataset has a real-valued output or target. Figure <a href="#figure-1">1</a> shows how a regression curve is fitted which best explains all these points. Here, the curve is a straight line, so this is an example of linear regression. The regression task is to learn this curve, which explains the underlying distribution of the data points. The curve can then be used to make predictions for new data points; the target for a new sample will lie on the curve learned by the regression task.</p>

<p>Linear regression is a technique used to analyze a linear relationship between input variables (independent variables) and a single target variable. A linear relationship means that the data points tend to follow a straight line. Simple linear regression involves only a single input variable. Figure 2 shows a dataset with a linear relationship.</p>

<figure id="figure-2" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="images/linear_regression_generated_data.png" alt="regression.

<p>In linear regression, our goal is to find the line that best models the path of the data points. Figure 3 shows the dataset we used in Figure 2 with a line of best fit through it. The position of the line is determined by certain fitting coefficients (in this simple case, the gradient and intercept) and linear regression helps us pick appropriate values for these coefficients. In this example we have only one input variable and the problem is therefore simple linear regression. Note that in real problems we have more than one input variable. In this case, we call it multiple linear regression. Adding extra input variables just means that we’ll need to find more weights.</p>

  <p>Once we have a prediction in regression problems, we need some way to tell if it’s reasonable or not. A cost function helps us do this. The cost function compares all the predictions against their actual values and provides a single number that we can use as a measure. Two common cost functions are the error and squared error. The error is how far our prediction is away from the actual value (Figure 4).</p>

  <figure id="figure-4" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="images/cost_function.png" alt="regression.

  <p>We know an error above the actual value and an error below the actual value should be about as bad as each other. The squared error makes this clear because both positive and negative values of the error result in a positive squared error. We will use the Mean Squared Error (MSE) function as our cost function. This function finds the average squared error value for all of our data points. Cost functions are important to us because they measure how accurate our model is against the target values.</p>

<h1 id="analyze-dna-methylation-dataset">Analyze DNA methylation dataset</h1>

<p>As a benchmark, we will use the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1872497317301643?via%3Dihub">DNA methylation dataset</a> to predict the chronological age. One important reason to choose this dataset for an age prediction task is that DNA methylation changes with age and this change occurs at specific CpG sites in humans. 
It has been recognized that DNA methylation analysis, which mostly occurs in a CpG sequence context, can give additional information besides the DNA profile.  It has been shown that DNA methylation changes with age within each individual. This alteration in DNA methylation occurs at specific CpG sites in all individuals, but with individual differences in “speed”, showing more DNA methylation differences in older twins compared to young ones.</p>

<p>Epigenomic and phenotypic changes which are age-dependent are also contained in these cells. This knowledge is used to select useful biomarkers from the DNA methylation dataset. The CpG sites with the highest correlation to age are selected as biomarkers (features). In this study, specific biomarkers are analyzed by machine learning algorithms to create an age prediction model.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will apply a couple of (<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a>) machine learning tools to DNA methylation datasets to predict the chronological age of humans.</p>

<h2 id="get-training-and-test-datasets">Get training and test datasets</h2>

<p>Whole blood samples are collected from humans with their ages falling in the range 18-69 and the best age-correlated CpG sites in the genome are chosen as features. The dataset is divided into two parts - training and test sets. The training set is used to train a regressor and the test set is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. We proceed with the analysis by uploading new datasets and creating a new history.</p>

<p class="comment">The datasets from this study contain features (present as columns). The last column in the dataset refers to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Age</code>, which is used as labels/targets. Since the targets are real numbers, the machine learning task becomes a regression problem. Using these features and targets, a model is built which learns a mapping between these input features and targets. The training set contains <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">208</code> rows corresponding to individual samples and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">13</code> features (age-correlated CpG sites in DNA methylation dataset). The last column is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Age</code>. The test set contains <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">104</code> rows and the same number of features as the training set. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Age</code> column in the test set is predicted after training on the training set. Another dataset <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test_rows_labels</code> contains the true age values of the test set which is used to compute scores between true and predicted age.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">train_rows</code> contains a column <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Age</code> which is the label or target.

In both the plots, the true and predicted targets are plotted in a scatter plot.

In figure <a href="#figure-8">8</a>, we can see that the points are scattered and do not show any pattern. Therefore, the R2 score is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-0.06</code>. On the other hand, figure <a href="#figure-9">9</a> shows a better pattern as most of the points lie along the line and the R2 score is almost <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.0</code>.

<p>Linear regression is a useful technique but isn’t always the right choice for our real problems. Linear regression is a good choice when there is a linear relationship between your independent and dependent variables and you are trying to predict continuous values.</p>

<p>It is not a good choice when the relationship between independent and dependent variables is more complicated. For example, Figure 10 shows a dataset that does not have a linear relationship so linear regression would not be a good choice.</p>

It is an ensemble-based regressor because its prediction is the collective performance of multiple weak learners (e.g. decision trees). It learns features from training dataset and maps all the rows to their respective targets (real numbers). The process of mapping gives a trained model.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1872497317301643?via%3Dihub">Jana Naue et al. (2017)</a> used <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor">Random Forest</a> (another ensemble-based regressor) as regressor and we can conclude from this study that an ensemble-based regressor works well on this DNA methylation dataset. Therefore, we will use gradient boosting to build a prediction model.</p>

<p>Like the random forest method, gradient boosting is an ensemble-based regressor, because it uses multiple decision tree regressors internally and makes predictions by taking the collective performances of predictions made by multiple decision trees. It has a good predictive power and is robust to outliers. It creates an ensemble of weak learners (decision trees) and iteratively minimizes errors. One disadvantage, which comes from its basic principle of boosting, is that it cannot be parallelized. <em>Hint:</em> Please find the following tool in “Machine learning” tool section in Galaxy.</p>

The default value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n_estimators</code> for this regressor is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">100</code>. However, we are not sure if this gives the best accuracy. Therefore, it is important to try setting this parameter to different values to find the optimal one. We choose some values which are less than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">100</code> and a few more than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">100</code>. The hyperparameter search will look for the optimal number of estimators and gives the best-trained model as one of the outputs.

      <li>(Even though the default value of the number of estimators for the gradient boosting regressor is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">100</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">75</code> gives the best accuracy. That’s why it is important to perform hyperparameter search to tune these parameters for any dataset). 50 estimators also give almost the same accuracy.</li>

<p>We can see in the scatter plot (figure <a href="#figure-13">13</a>) that most of the points lie along the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x = y</code> curve. This tells us that the true and predicted ages are close to each other. The root mean square error (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RMSE</code>) is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.74</code> and the R2 score is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.94</code>.</p>

<p>We can see that the predicted values are close to the true values.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="#figure-13">13</a> shows that we achieved an R2 score of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.94</code> and root mean square score of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.74</code> for the test set using Gradient boosting regressor. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1872497317301643?via%3Dihub">Jana Naue et al. 2017</a> mention a similar root mean square score (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.93</code>) using the random forest regressor. The root mean square score shows the difference between the true and predicted age of humans. The R2 score (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.94</code>) is close to the best achievable score of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.0</code> which shows that the trained model is good. Overall, the second part of the analysis also shows that using the machine learning tools in Galaxy, we can achieve state-of-the-art predictions mentioned in the recent scientific studies.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>By following these steps, we learned how to perform regression and visualize the predictions using Galaxy’s machine learning and plotting tools. The features of the training dataset are mapped to the real-valued targets. This mapping is used to make predictions on an unseen (test) dataset. 
The quality of predictions is visualized using multiple plots to ascertain the robustness of machine learning tasks. There are many other regressors in the machine learning suite which can be tried out on these datasets to find how they perform. Different datasets can also be analyzed using these regressors. The regressors have many parameters which can be altered while performing the analyses to see if they affect the prediction accuracy. It may be beneficial to perform a hyperparameter search to tune these parameters for different datasets.</p>

					<b>Disliked</b>: In one place you write: “Select input data file”: test_rows_labels_without_header.csv Here the ".csv" suffix is not needed because it's not part of the name we gave to it. It's tabular file anyway.  In multiple places the figure references are wrong:  The residual plot shown in figure 9 -> figure 7  To infer how its values exhibit model performance, we can compare the figures 7 and 8. -> figures 8 and 9  Figures 5, 6 and 9 show that the prediction is acceptable -> figures 5, 6 and 7  The idea of cross-validation is shown in figure 3. -> figure 12
