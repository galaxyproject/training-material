      learning</a> uses the techniques from statistics, mathematics and computer
      science to make computer programs learn from data. It is one of the most
      popular fields of computer science and finds applications in multiple
      streams of data analysis like <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classification</a>,
      <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">regression</a>,

      estimation</a> and many more. Some real-life applications are spam
      filtering, medical diagnosis, autonomous driving, recommendation systems,
      facial recognition, stock prices prediction and many more. The following
      image shows a basic flow of any machine learning task. A user has data and
      it is given to a machine learning algorithm for analysis.

      There are multiple ways in which machine learning can be used to perform
      data analysis. They depend on the nature of data and the kind of data
      analysis. The following image shows the most popular ones. In <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning">supervised
      learning</a> techniques, the categories of data records are known
      beforehand. But in <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning">unsupervised
      learning</a>, the categories of data records are not known.
    backdrop: true

      The complete data is divided into training and test sets. The training set
      is used by a classifier to learn features. It results in a trained model
      and its robustness (of learning) is evaluated using the test set (unseen
      by the classifier during the training).

      This tutorial shows how to use a machine learning module implemented as a
      Galaxy tool. The data used in this tutorial is available at <a

      The datasets required for this tutorial contain 9 features of breast
      cancer which include the thickness of clump, cell-size, cell-shape and so
      on (<a
      href="https://github.com/EpistasisLab/penn-ml-benchmarks/tree/master/datasets/classification/breast-w">more
      information</a>). In addition to these features, the training dataset
      contains one more column as `target`. It has a binary value (0 or 1) for
      each row. `0` indicates no breast cancer and `1` indicates breast cancer.
      The test dataset does not contain the `target` column.

      In this step, <b>SVM (Support vector machine)</b> classifier is trained
      using `breast-w_train` dataset. The last column of this dataset assigns a
      category for each row. The classifier learns a mapping between each row
      and its category. This mapping is called a trained model. It is used to
      predict the categories of unseen data (`breast-w_test`).
