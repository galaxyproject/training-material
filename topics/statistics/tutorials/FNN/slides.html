# What is an artificial neural network?

???

What is an artificial neural network?

---

# Artificial Neural Networks

- ML discipline roughly inspired by how neurons in a human brain work
- Huge resurgence due to availability of data and computing capacity
- Various types of neural networks (Feedforward, Recurrent, Convolutional)
- FNN applied to classification, clustering, regression, and association

---

# Inspiration for neural networks

- Neuron a special biological cell with information processing ability
	- Receives signals from other neurons through its *dendrites*
	- If the signals received exceeds a threshold, the neuron fires
	- Transmits signals to other neurons via its *axon*
- *Synapse*: contact between axon of a neuron and denderite of another
	- Synapse either enhances/inhibits the signal that passes through it
	- Learning occurs by changing the effectiveness of synapse

# Celebral cortex

- Outter most layer of brain, 2 to 3 mm thick, surface area of 2,200 sq. cm
- Has about 10^11 neurons
	- Each neuron connected to 10^3 to 10^4 neurons
	- Human brain has 10^14 to 10^15 connections

---

# Celebral cortex

- Neurons communicate by signals ms in duration
	- Signal transmission frequency up to several hundred Hertz
	- Millions of times slower than an electronic circuit
	- Complex tasks like face recognition done within a few hundred ms
	- Computation involved cannot take more than 100 serial steps
- The information sent from one neuron to another is very small
	- Critical information not transmitted
	- But captured by the interconnections
- Distributed computation/representation of the brain
	- Allows slow computing elements to perform complex tasks quickly

---


# Perceptron

![Neurons forming the input and output layers of a single layer feedforward neural network](/training-material/topics/statistics/images/FFNN_no_hidden.png) &lt;!-- https://pixy.org/3013900/ CC0 license--&gt;

---

# Learning in Perceptron

- Given a set of input-output pairs (called *training set*)
- Learning algorithm iteratively adjusts model parameters
	- Weights and biases
- So the model can accurately map inputs to outputs
- Perceptron learning algorithm

---

# Limitations of Perceptron

- Single layer FNN cannot solve problems in which data is not linearly separable
	- E.g., the XOR problem
- Adding one (or more) hidden layers enables FNN to represent any function
	- *Universal Approximation Theorem*
- Perceptron learning algorithm could not extend to  multi-layer FNN
	- AI winter
- *Backpropagation* algorithm in 80's enabled learning in multi-layer FNN

---

# Multi-layer FNN

![Neurons forming the input, output, and hidden layers of a multi-layer feedforward neural network](/training-material/topics/statistics/images/FFNN.png) &lt;!-- https://pixy.org/3013900/ CC0 license--&gt;

- More hidden layers (and more neurons in each hidden layer)
	- Can estimate more complex functions
	- More parameters increases training time
	- More likelihood of *overfitting*

---

# Activation functions

![Table showing the formula, graph, derivative, and range of common activation functions](/training-material/topics/statistics/images/FNN_activation_functions.png) &lt;!-- https://pixy.org/3013900/ CC0 license--&gt;

---

# Supervised learning


- Training set of size *m*: { (x^1,y^1),(x^2,y^2),...,(x^m,y^m) }
	- Each pair (x^i,y^i) is called a *training example*
	- x^i is called *feature vector*
	- Each element of feature vector is called a *feature*
	- Each x^i corresponds to a *label* y^i
- We assume an unknown function y=f(x) maps feature vectors to labels
- The goal is to use the training set to learn or estimate f
	- We want the estimate to be close to f(x) not only for training set
	- But for training examples not in training set

---

# Classification problems

![Three images illustrating binary, multiclass, and multilabel classifications and their label representation](/training-material/topics/statistics/images/FNN_output_encoding.png) &lt;!-- https://pixy.org/3013900/ CC0 license--&gt;

---

# Output layer

- Binary classification
	- Single neuron in output layer
	- Sigmoid activation function
	- Activation &gt; 0.5, output 1
	- Activation &lt;= 0.5, output 0
- Multilabel classification
	- As many neurons in output layer as number of classes
	- Sigmoid activation function
	- Activation &gt; 0.5, output 1
	- Activation &lt;= 0.5, output 0
---

# Output layer (Continued)

- Multiclass classification
	- As many neurons in output layer as number of classes
	- *Softmax* activation function
	- Takes input to neurons in output layer
	- Creates a probability distribution, sum of outputs adds up to 1
	- The neuron with the highest proability is the predicted label
- Regression problem
	- Single neuron in output layer
	- Linear activation function

---

# Loss/Cost functions

- During training, for each training example (x^i,y^i), we present x^i to neural network
	- Compare predicted output with label y^1
	- Need loss function to measure difference between predicted &amp; expected output
- Use *Cross entropy* loss function for classification problems
- And *Quadratic* loss function for regression problems
	- Quadratic cost function is also called *Mean Squared Error (MSE)*

---

# Cross Entropy Loss/Cost functions

---

# Backpropagation (BP) learning algorithm

- A *gradient descent* technique
	- Find local minimum of a function by iteratively moving in opposite direction of gradient of function at current point
- Goal of learning is to minimize cost function given training set
	- Cost function is a function of network weights &amp; biases of all neurons in all layers
	- Backpropagation iteratively computes gradient of cost function relative to each weight and bias
	- Updates weights and biases in the opposite direction of gradient
	- Gradients (partial derivatives) are used to update weights and biases
	- To find a local minimum

---

# Backpropagation error

![Backpropagation error](/training-material/topics/statistics/images/FNN_BP_Error.png) &lt;!-- https://pixy.org/3013900/ CC0 license--&gt;

---

# Backpropagation formulas

![Backpropagation formulas](/training-material/topics/statistics/images/FNN_BP.png) &lt;!-- https://pixy.org/3013900/ CC0 license--&gt;

---

# Types of Gradient Descent

- *Batch* gradient descent
	- Calculate gradient for each weight/bias for *all* samples
	- Average gradients and update weights/biases
	- Slow, if we have too many samples

- *Stochastic* gradient descent
	- Update weights/biases based on gradient of *each* sample
	- Fast. Not accurate if sample gradient not representiative

- *Mini-batch* gradient descent
	- Middle ground solution
	- Calculate gradient for each weight/bias for all samples in *batch*
		- batch size is much smaller than training set size
	- Average batch gradients and update weights/biases

---

# Vanishing gradient problem

- Second BP equation is recursive
	- We have derivative of activation function
	- Calc. error in layer prior to output: 1 mult. by derivative value
	- Calc. error in two layers prior output: 2 mult. by derivative values

- If derivative values are small (e.g. for Sigmoid), product of multiple small values will be a very small value
	- Since error values decide updates for biases/weights
	- Update to biases/weights in first layers will be very small
		- Slowing the learning algorithm to a halt
	- The reason Sigmoid not used in deep networks
		- Why ReLU is popular in deep networks

---

# Car purchase price prediction

- Given 5 features of an individual (age, gender, miles driven per day, personal debt, and monthly income)
	- And, money they spent buying a car
	- Learn a FNN to predict how much someone will spend buying a car
- We evaluate FNN on test dataset and plot graphs to assess the model’s performance
	- Training dataset has 723 training examples
	- Test dataset has 242 test examples
	- Input features scaled to be in 0 to 1 range
