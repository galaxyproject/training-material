    summary: "IWTomics is an R/Bioconductor package (integrated in Galaxy) that, exploiting sophisticated Functional Data Analysis techniques (i.e. statistical techniques that deal with the analysis of curves), allows users to pre-process, visualize and test these data at multiple locations and scales."
