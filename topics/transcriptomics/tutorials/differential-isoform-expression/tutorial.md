# Introduction

Discovered over 40 years ago, {AS} formed a large part of the puzzle explaining how proteomic complexity can be achieved with a limited set of genes  ({% cite Alt1980 %}). The majority of eukaryote genes have multiple transcriptional isoforms, and recent data indicate that each transcript of protein-coding genes contain 11 exons and produce 5.4 mRNAs on average ({% cite Piovesan2016 %}). In humans,  approximately 95% of multi-exon genes show evidence of {AS} and approximately 60% of genes have at least one alternative transcription start site, some of which exert antagonistic functions ({% cite Carninci2006 %}, {% cite Miura2012 %}). Its regulation is essential for providing cells and tissues their specific features, and for their response to environmental changes ({% cite Wang2008 %}, {% cite Kalsotra2011 %}).

Alterations in gene splicing has been demonstrated to have significant impact on cancer development, and multiple evidences indicate that its disruption can exhibit effects on virtually all aspect of tumor progression ({% cite Namba2021 %}, {% cite Bonnal2020 %}). For instance, the unannotated isoform of TNS3 was found to be a novel driver of breast cancer ({% cite Namba2021 %}). 

![Figure 01. Examples of cancer splicing dysregulation on cancer hallmarks](../../images/differential_isoform/differential_cancer.png "Effect of alternative splicing dysregulation on cancer progression. The diagram depicts various cancer hallmarks and examples of genes whose splicing dysregulation has been demostrated to be implicated in the corresponding functional modification.")

Disregulation in {AS} can lead to the activation of {OCGs} or the inactivation of {TSGs}, which can promote or suppress tumorigenesis, respectively ({% cite Bashyam2019 %}). However, the strict classification of cancer genes as either {OCGs} or {TSGs} may be an oversimplification, as some genes can exhibit a dual role in cancer development, often impacting the same facet of tumorigenesis ({% cite Bashyam2019 %}). One of the mechanism that has been proposed to partially explain this apparently contradictory effect is the differential usage of isoforms, often referred to as {IS}. This regulatory phenomenon has been demonstrated to have a substantial biological impact in a diverse range of biological contexts, caused by functional diversity potential of the different isoforms ({% cite VittingSeerup2017 %}). 

In this tutorial, we aim to perform a genome-wide analysis of {IS} in cancer, with the objective of identifying genes of potential clinical relevance and gene regulatory networks on genome-scale.

# Background on data

The datasets consist of twelve FASTQ files, generated through the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing system. Half of the samples were obtained from PANC1 tumour lines, and the rest from control cells. The protocol used for extracting the samples includes the depletion of rRNAs by subtractive hybridization, a general strategy for mRNA enrichment in RNA-seq samples. For this training we will use a reduced set of reads, in order to speed up the analysis. The original datasets are available in the NCBI SRA database, with the accession number [PRJNA542693](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA542693).

## Get data

The first step of our analysis consists of retrieving the RNA-seq datasets from Zenodo and organizing them into collections.

# Quality assessment

Once we have got the datasets, we can start with the analysis. The first step is to perform the quality assessment. Since this step is deeply covered in the tutorial [Quality control]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.md %}), we won't describe this section in detail.


> <comment-title>Initial quality evaluation (OPTIONAL)</comment-title>
>
>   For the initial quality evaluation, it is necessary to perform a pre-processing step consisting in flattening the list of pairs into a simple list; this step is required because of issues between **FastQC** and **MultiQC**. The `Raw data QC` files generated by **FastQC** will be combine into a a single one by making use of **MultiQC**.

## Read pre-processing with fastp

In order to remove the adaptors we will make use of **fastp**, which is able to detect the adapter sequence by performing a per-read overlap analysis, so we won't even need to specify the adapter sequences.

# RNA-seq mapping and isoform quantification

The following section can be considered as the hard-core part of the training, the reason is  not because of it’s complexity (not all the details about the computational procedures will be presented, just those elements required for a basic understanding), but because it allows to characterize isoform quantification approach as genome-guided-based method.

> <comment-title>Transcriptome-reconstruction approaches</comment-title>
>
>  The different methods for estimating transcript/isoform abundance can be classified depending on two main requirements: reference sequence and alignment. Reference-guided transcriptome assembly strategy requires to aligning sequencing reads to a reference genome first, and then assembling overlapping alignments into transcripts. In contrast, *de novo* transcriptome assembly methods directly reconstructs overlapping reads into transcripts by utilising the redundancy of sequencing reads themselves ({% cite Lu2013 %}).
>
{: .comment}

In that section makes use of three main tools: **RNA STAR**, considered a state-of-the-art mapping tool for RNA-seq data, **RSeQC**, a package that allows comprehensively evaluate different aspects of the RNA-seq data, and **StringTie**, which uses a genome-guided transcriptome assembly approach along with concepts from de novo genome assembly to perform transcript assembly and quantification.

## RNA-seq mapping with **RNA STAR**

**RNA STAR** is a splice-aware RNA-seq alignment tool that allows to identify canonical and non-canonical splice junctions by making use of sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure ({% cite Krianovi2017 %}). One advantage of **RNA STAR** with respect to other tools is that it includes a feature called *two-pass mode*, a framework in which splice junctions are separately discovered and quantified, allowing robustly and accurately identify  splice junction patterns for differential splicing analysis and variant discovery.

> <details-title>RNA STAR two-pass mode</details-title>
>
> During two-pass mode splice junctions are discovered in a first alignment pass with high stringency, and are used as annotation in a second pass to permit lower stringency alignment, and therefore higher sensitivity (fig. 3). Two-pass alignment enables sequence reads to span novel splice junctions by fewer nucleotides, conferring greater read depth and providing significantly more accurate quantification of novel splice junctions that one-pass alignment ({% cite Veeneman2015 %}).
>
> ![Figure 03. RNA STAR twopass mode](../../images/differential_isoform/RNASTAR_twopass_mode.png "Two-pass alignment flowchart. Center and right, stepwise progression of two-pass alignment. First, the genome is indexed with gene annotation. Next, novel splice junctions are discovered from RNA sequencing data at a relatively high stringency (12 nt minimum spanning length). Third, these discovered splice junctions, and expressed annotated splice junctions are used to re-index the genome. Finally, alignment is performed a second time, quantifying novel and annotated splice junctions using the same, relatively lower stringency (3 nt minimum spanning length), producing splice junction expression. Source: Veeneman et al., 2016.")
>
{: .details}



The choice of **RNA STAR** as mapper is also determined by the sequencing technology; it has been demonstrated adequate for short-read sequencing data, but when using long-read data, such as PacBio or ONT reads, it is recommended to use **GMAP** as alignment tool ({% cite Krianovi2017 %}).

> <comment-title>Intron spanning in RNA-seq analysis</comment-title>
>
> RNA-seq mappers need to face the challenge associated with intron spanning of mature mRNA molecules, from which introns have been removed by splicing (single short read might align to two locations that are separated by 10 kbp or more). The complexity of this operation can be better understood if we take in account that for a typical human RNA-seq data set using 100-bp reads, more than 35% of the reads will span multiple exons.

Before moving to the transcriptome assembly and quantification step, we are going to use **RSeQC** in order to obtain some RNA-seq-specific quality control metrics.

## RNA-seq specific quality control metrics with **RSeQC**

RNA-seq-specific quality control metrics, such as sequencing depth, read distribution and coverage uniformity, are essential to ensure that the RNA-seq data are adequate for transcriptome reconstruction and {AS} analysis. For example, the use of RNA-seq with unsaturated sequencing depth gives imprecise estimations  and fails to detect low abundance splice junctions, limiting the precision of many analyses ({% cite Wang2012 %}).

In this section we will make use of of the **RSeQC** toolkit in order to generate the RNA-seq-specific quality control metrics. But before starting, we need to convert the annotation GTF file into BED12 format, which will be required in subsequent steps.

> <hands-on-title>GTF to BED12 GTF conversion</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [Convert GTF to BED12](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/gtftobed12/gtftobed12/357) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"GTF File to convert"*: `gencode.v43.annotation.gtf.gz`
>    - *"Advanced options"*: `Set advanced options`
>        - *"Ignore groups without exons"*: `Yes`
>
> 2. Rename the output as `BED12 annotation`
>
{: .hands_on}

We are going to use the following RSeQC modules:

- **Infer Experiment**: inference of RNA-seq configuration
- **Gene Body Coverage**: compute read coverage over gene bodies
- **Junction Saturation**: check junction saturation
- **Junction Annotation**: compares detected splice junctions to a reference gene model
- **Read Distribution**: calculates how mapped reads are distributed over genome features

Once all required outputs have been generated, we will integrate them by using **MultiQC** in order to interpret the results.

First, we will evaluate the plot corresponding to the **RNA STAR** alignment scores (fig. 4), which will allow us to easily compare the samples to get an overview of the quality of the samples. As a general criteria, we can consider that good quality samples should have at least 75% of the reads uniquely mapped. In our case, of samples have unique mapping values over 90%.

![Figure 04. RNA STAR alignment stats plot](../../images/differential_isoform/star_alignment.png "RNA star alignment stats plot. Note that STAR counts a paired-end read as one read.")

Now we can have a look at the **RSeQC** results;  we will evaluate the RSeQC **Read Distribution plot** (fig. 5).

![Figure 05. RSeQC read distribution plot](../../images/differential_isoform/rseqc_read_distribution_plot.png "RSeQC read distribution. This module will calculate how mapped reads were distributed over genome feature (like CDS exon, 5’UTR exon, 3’ UTR exon, Intron, Intergenic regions).")

In that case, all samples show a similar trend, both in health and cancer samples, with most reads mapping on CDS exons (around 72%), 5'UTR (around 4.5%) and 3'UTR (around 13.5%).

Now we will evaluate the results of the **Infer Experiment** module, which allows to speculate the experimental design (whether sequencing is strand-specific, and if so, how reads are stranded) by sampling a subset of reads from the BAM file and comparing their genome coordinates and strands with those of the reference gene model ({% cite Wang2012 %}).

![Figure 06. RSeQC infer experiment plot](../../images/differential_isoform/rseqc_infer_experiment_plot.png "RSeQC Infer Experiment plot. It counts the percentage of reads and read pairs that match the strandedness of overlapping transcripts. It can be used to infer whether RNA-seq library preps are stranded (sense or antisense).")

As can be appreciated in the image, the proportion of reads assigned as *sense* is similar to the ones assigned as *antisense*, which indicates that in that case our RNA-seq data is non-strand specific.

Now, let's evaluate the results generated by the **Gene Body Coverage** module. It scales all transcripts to 100 nt and calculates the number of reads covering each nucleotide position. The plot generated from this information illustrates the coverage profile along the gene body, defined as the entire gene from the transcription start site to the end of the transcript (fig. 7).

![Figure 07. RSeQC gene body coverage plot](../../images/differential_isoform/rseqc_gene_body_coverage_plot.png "RSeQC gene body coverage plot. It calculates read coverage over gene bodies. This is used to check if reads coverage is uniform and if there is any 5' or 3' bias.")

The gene body coverage pattern is highly influenced by the RNA-seq protocol, and it is useful for identifying artifacts such as 3' skew in libraries. For example, a skew towards increased 3' coverage can happen in degraded samples prepared with poly-A selection. According the figure 5, there're not bias in our reads as a result of sequencing technical problems.

Other important metric for {AS} analysis is the one provided by the **Junction Saturation** module, which allows to determine if the current sequencing depth is sufficient to perform {AS} analyses by comparing the detected splice junctions to reference gene model (fig. 8).

Since for a well annotated organism both the number of expressed genes and spliced junctions is considered to be almost fixed, if the number of known junctions reaches a plateau means that the current sequencing depth is almost saturated for known junction detection. In other words, nearly all known junctions have already been detected, and deeper sequencing will not likely detect additional known junctions. Using an unsaturated sequencing depth would miss many rare splice junctions ({% cite Wang2012 %}).

> <comment-title>RSeQC junction saturation details</comment-title>
>
> This approach helps identify if the sequencing depth is sufficient for {AS} analysis. However, it relies on the reference gene model for junction comparison, which might not be complete or accurate for all organisms. In addition, it might not provide enough information for novel junction detection, as the sequencing depth might still be insufficient for detecting new splice junctions.

![Figure 08. RSeQC junction saturation plot](../../images/differential_isoform/rseqc_junction_saturation_plot.png "RSeQC junction saturation. Saturation is checked by re-sampling the alignments from the BAM file, and the splice junctions from each subset is detected (green) and and compared them to the reference model (grey).")

As we can appreciate in the plot, the known junctions tend to stabilize around 110.000, which indicates that the read sequencing depth is good enough for performing the {AS} analysis.

After confirming that the saturation level is good enough, finally, we will check the output generated by the RSeQC junction annotation module; it allows to evaluate both splice junctions (multiple reads show the same splicing event) and splice events (single read level) (fig. 9).

![Figure 09.A RSeQC junction annotation plot](../../images/differential_isoform/rseqc_junction_annotation_junctions_plot.png "RSeQC junction annotation. The detected junctions and events are divided in three exclusive categories: known splicing junctions (blue), partial novel splicing junction (one of the splice site is novel) (grey) and new splicing junctions (green). Splice events refer to the number of times a RNA-read is spliced (A). Splice junctions correspond to multiple splicing events spanning the same intron.") 

According to the results, despite the number of new (or partially new) splicing junctions is relatively slow (around 0.5%), a large proportion of reads show novel splicing junction patterns.

After evaluating the quality of the RNA-seq data, we can start with the transcriptome assembly step.

## Transcriptome assembly and quantification with **StringTie**

**StringTie** is a fast and highly efficient assembler of RNA-seq alignments into potential transcripts. It uses a network flow algorithm to reconstruct transcripts and quantitate them simultaneously. This algorithm is combined with an assembly method to merge read pairs into full fragments in the initial phase ({% cite Kovaka2019 %}, {% cite Pertea2015 %}).

> <comment-title>StringTie algorithm</comment-title>
>
> StringTie first groups the reads into clusters, collapsing the reads that align to the identical location on the genome and keeping a count of how many alignments were collapsed,  then creates a splice graph for each cluster from which it identifies transcripts, and then for each transcript it creates a separate flow network to estimate its expression level using a maximum flow algorithm ({% cite Pertea2015 %}) (fig. 10).
>
> ![Figure 10. StringTie algorithm details](../../images/differential_isoform/stringtie_algorithm.png "Transcript assembly pipeline for StringTie. It begins with a set of RNA-seq reads that have been mapped to the genome. StringTie iteratively extracts the heaviest path from a splice graph, constructs a flow network, computes maximum flow to estimate abundance, and then updates the splice graph by removing reads that were assigned by the flow algorithm. This process repeats until all reads have been assigned. Source: Perea et al., 2015")
>
> **StringTie** uses an aggressive strategy for identifying and removing spurious spliced alignments. If a spliced read is aligned with more than 1% mismatches, keeping in mind that Illumina sequencers have an error rate < 0.5%, then **StringTie** requires 25% more reads than usual (the default is 1 read per bp) to support that particular spliced alignment. In addition, if a spliced read spans a very long intron (more than 100,000 bp), **StringTie** accepts that alignment (and the intron) only if a larger anchor of 25 bp (10 bp is the default) is present on both sides of the splice site. Here the term “anchor” refers to the portion of the read aligned within the exon beginning at the exon-intron boundary ({% cite Kovaka2019 %}).
>
>
{: .comment}

The main reason underlying the greater accuracy of **StringTie** most likely derives from its optimization criteria. By balancing the coverage (or flow) of each transcript across each assembly, it incorporates depth of coverage constraints into the assembly algorithm itself. When assembling a whole genome, coverage is a crucial parameter that must be used to constrain the algorithm; otherwise an assembler may incorrectly collapse repetitive sequences. Similarly, when assembling a transcript, each exon within an isoform should have similar coverage, and ignoring this parameter may produce sets of transcripts that are parsimonious but wrong ({% cite Pertea2015 %}).


> <details-title>StringTie long RNA-seq assembly</details-title>
>
> To handle the high error rates in the long reads, **StringTie** implements two techniques. First, it correct potentially wrong splice sites by checking all the splice sites present in the alignment of a read with a high-error alignment rate. If a splice site is not supported by any low-error alignment reads, then it tries to find a nearby splice site (within 10 bp, by default) that is supported by the most alignments among all nearby splice sites. Secondly, it implements a pruning algorithm that reduces the size of the splicing graph to a more realistic size by removing the edges in the graph starting from the edge least supported by reads to the most supported edge, until the number of nodes in the splicing graph falls under a given threshold (by default 1000 nodes).

{: .details}

Despite in this training we make use of RNA STAR as mapping tool, it is possible to use different splice-aware aligner such as HISAT2. Independently of the tool, each record with a spliced alignment should have the XS tag in the SAM/BAM file, which indicates the genomic strand from which the RNA that produced the read originated .

# Isoform analysis with **IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR**

**IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR** is an open-source R package that enables both analyze changes in genome-wide patterns of {AS} and specific gene isoforms switch consequences (note: {AS} literally will result in {IS}). An advantage of **IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR** over other approaches is that it allows allows to integrate multiple layers of information, such as previously annotated coding sequences, de-novo coding potential predictions, protein domains and signal peptides. In addition, IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR facilitates identification of IS by making use of a new statistical methods that tests each individual isoform for differential usage, identifying the exact isoforms involved in an {IS} ({% cite isoformswitchanalyzer %})

> <comment-title>Nonsense mediated decay</comment-title>

> If transcript structures are predicted (either de-novo or guided) **IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR** offers an accurate tool for identifying the dominant ORF of the isoforms. The knowledge of isoform positions for the CDS/ORF allows for prediction of sensitivity to Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD) — the mRNA quality control machinery that degrades isoforms with pre-mature termination codons (PTC).

In this training, the IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR stage is divided in four steps:

1. Data import: import into **IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR** the transcription-level expression measurement dataset generated by **Stringtie**. This step also requires to import the GTF annotation file and the transcriptome.
2. Pre-processing step: non-informative gene/isoforms are removed from the datasets and differentially isoform usage analysis with **DEXSeq**. Once the {IS} have been found, the corresponding nucleotide and aminoacid sequences are extracted.
3. Outward sequence analysis: The sequences obtained in the previous step are used in order to evaluate their coding potential and the motifs that they contain by using two different tools: **PfamScan** and **CPAT**.
4. Isoform splicing analysis: The final step involves importing and incorporating the results of the external sequence analysis, identifying intron retention, predicting functional consequences and generating the reports.

Now, we can start with the {IS} analysis.

It generates a **switchAnalyzeRlist** object that contains all relevant information about the isoforms involved in isoform swtches, such as each comparison of an isoform between conditions.



## Pre-processing step

Once the datasets have been imported into a RData file, we can start with the pre-processing step. In order to enhace the reliability of the downstream analysis, it is important to remove the non-informative genes/isoforms (e.g. single isoform genes and non-expressed isoforms).

After the pre-processing, **IsoformSwitchAnalyzieR** performs the differential isoform usage analysis by using **DESXSeq**, which despite originally designed for testing differential exon usage, it has demonstrated to perform exceptionally well for differential isoform usage.**DEXSeq** uses generalized linear models to assess the significance of observed differences in isoform usage values between conditions, taking into account the biological variation between replicates ({% cite dexseq %}).

> <comment-title>Difference in isoform fraction contept</comment-title>
>
> IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR measures isoform usage vian isoform fraction (IF) values which quantifies the fraction of the parent gene expression originating from a specific isoform, (calculated as isoform_exp / gene_exp). Consequently, the difference in isoform usage is quantified as the difference in isoform fraction (dIF) calculated as IF2 - IF1, and these dIF are used to measure the effect size  ({% cite isoformswitchanalyzer %}).
>
{: .comment}

IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR uses two parameters to define a significant {IS}:

- Alpha: the FDR corrected P-value (Q-value) cutoff.
- dIFcutoff: the minimum (absolute) change in isoform usage (dIF).

This combination is used since a Q-value is only a measure of the statistical certainty of the difference between two groups and thereby does not reflect the effect size which is measured by the dIF values ({% cite isoformswitchanalyzer %}).

## Outward sequence analysis

The next step is to use to use generated FASTA files corresponding to the aminoacid and nucleotide sequences to perform the external analysis tools. In that case, we will use **PfamScan** for predicting protein domains and **CPAT** predicting the coding potential. This information will be integrated in the downstream analysis.

### Protein domain identification with **PfamScan**

PfamScan is an open-source tool developed by the EMBL-EBI for identifying protein motifs. It allows to search FASTA sequences against Pfam HMM libraries. This tool requires three input datasets:

- Pfam-A HMMs in an HMM library searchable with the hmmscan program: Pfam-A.hmm.gz
- Pfam-A HMM Stockholm file associated with each HMM required for PfamScan: Pfam-A.hmm.dat.gz
- Active sites dataset: active_sites.dat.gz

>
> Pfam is a collection of multiple sequence alignments and profile hidden Markov models (HMMs). Each Pfam profile HMM represents a protein family or domain.  Pfam families are divided into two categories, Pfam-A and Pfam-B.

### Coding probablity prediction with **CPAT**

**CPAT** (Coding-Potential Assessment Tool ) is an open-source alignment-free tool, which uses logistic regression to distinguish between coding and noncoding transcripts on the basis of four sequence features. To achieve this goal, **CPAT** computes the following four metrics: maximum length of the open reading frame (ORF), ORF coverage, Fickett TESTCODE and Hexamer usage bias.

Each of those metrics is computed from a set of known protein-coding genes and another set of non-coding genes. **CPAT** will then builds a logistic regression model using theses as predictor variables and the “protein-coding status” as the response variable. After evaluating the performance and determining the probability cutoff, the model can be used to predict new RNA sequences ({% cite Wang2013 %}).

CPAT generates four files:

- No ORF: Sequence IDs or BED entries with no ORF found. Should be considered as non-coding.
- ORF probabilities (TSV): ORF information (strand, frame, start, end, size, Fickett TESTCODE score, Hexamer score) and coding probability.
- ORF best probabilities (TSV): The information of the best ORF. This file is a subset of the previous one.
- ORF sequences (FASTA): The top ORF sequences (at least 75 nucleotides long) in FASTA format.

For the downstream analysis, we will use only the `ORF best probabilities`, but it will require some minor modifications in order to be used as input to **IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR**.

## Isoform switching analysis

Once the expression data has been integrated and the required auxiliar information has been generated, we can start with the final stage of the analysis. **IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR** will extract the isoforms with significant changes in their isoform usage and the isoform, that compensate for the changes. Then, those isoforms are classified according to their contribution to gene expression (determinated by the dIF values). Finally, the isoforms with increased contribution (dIF values larger than the dIFcutoff) are compared in a pairwise manner to the isoforms with negative contribution.

IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR allows two analysis modes:

1. Analysis of individual {IS}
2. Genome-wide analysis of {IS}

In the next sections we will illustrate both different use-cases.

### Gene-specific isoform switching analysis

The gene-specific mode is interesting for those experimental designs which aim to evaluate a pre-selected set of genes of interest. For this purpose, we can analyze the expression pattern of the [gene RGMB](http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?g=ENSG00000174136;r=5:98768650-98798643) (repulsive guidance molecule BMP co-receptor b), whose aberrant expression is suggested to be associated with cancer cell proliferation through the BMP pathway ({% cite Shi2015 %}).

Let's have a look at the generated plot (fig. 13).

![Figure 13. RGMB gene isoform expression profile plot](../../images/differential_isoform/isoformSwitchAnalyzer_gene.png "RGMB isoform expression profile plot. The plot integrates isoform structures along with the annotations, gene and isoform expression and isoform usage including the result of the isoform switch test.")

In that case, we can appreciate that despite differences in overall gene expression is not statistically significant between health and cancerous tissues, there exists statistically significant {IS}: the isoform [ENST00000308234.11](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/J3KNF6/entry), which encodes the 478 aminoacid **Repulsive guidance molecule BMP co-receptor b protein** is repressed in cancer; on the other hand, the isoform [ENST00000513185.3](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q6NW40/entry), which encodes the 437 aminoanid **Repulsive guidance molecule B** is induced.

We will try to confirm this {IS} by visualising the coverage on this gene and more precisely on the region which is different between the two isoforms. We will take advantage of the coverage we generated with **STAR** and use a software called **pyGenomeTracks**

Let's have a look at the plot generated by **pyGenometracks** (fig. 14).

### IsoformSwitchAnalyzer genome-wide analysis

A genome-wide analysis is both useful for getting an overview of the extent of {IS} as well as discovering general patterns. In this training we will perform three different summaries/analyses for both the analysis of {AS} and {IS} with predicted consequences:

1. Global summary statistics for summarizing the number of switches with predicted consequences and the number of splicing events occurring in the different comparisons.
2. Analysis of splicing/consequence enrichment for analyzing whether a particular consequence/splice type occurs more frequently than the opposite event.
3. Analysis of genome-wide changes in isoform usage for analyzing the genome-wide changes in isoform usage for all isoforms with particular opposite pattern events.

> <comment-title>Difference in isoform fraction</comment-title>
>
> If an isoform has a significant change in its contribution to gene expression, there must per definition be reciprocal changes in one (or more) isoforms in the opposite direction, compensating for the change in the first isoform. Thus,the isoforms used more (positive dIF) can be compared to the isoforms used less (negative dIF) and by systematically identify differences annotation it is possible to identify potential function consequences of the {IS} event.

It generates five tabular files with the results of the different statistical analysis:

- Splicing summary: values of the different splicing events
- Splicing enrichment: results of enrichment statistical analysis for the different splicing events.
- Consequences summary: values of global usage of {IS}
- Consequences enrichment: results of enrichment statistical analysis for the different functional consequences.
- Switching gene/isoforms: list of genes with statistically significant isoform swiching between conditions (table 1). The switches are ranked (by p-value or switch size).

#### Analysis of splicing enrichment

In this section we will assess whether there are differences with respect to the type of {AS} event .

First, we will start analyzing the total number of splicing events (fig. 17).

![Figure 17. Summary of genome-wide total splicing events](../../images/differential_isoform/isoformSwitchAnalyzer_isoform_usage.png "Analysis of splicing enrichment. Number of isoforms significantly differentially used between cancer and health resulting in at least one splice event.")

From the figure 17 , it can be hypothesised that some of the {AS} events are not equally used. To formally analyze this type of uneven {AS}, **IsoformSwithAnalyzeR** computes the fraction of events being gains (as opposed to loss) and perform a statistical analysis of this fraction by using a binomial test (fig. 18).

![Figure 18. Enrichment/depletion in isoform switch with consequences statistical analysis](../../images/differential_isoform/isoformSwitchAnalyzer_splicing_event.png "Comparison of differential splicing events. The fraction (and 95% confidence inter-val) of isoform switches (x-axis) resulting in gain of a specific alternative splice event (indicated by y axis) in the switch from health to cancer. Dashed line indicate no enrichment/depletion. Color indicate if FDR < 0.05 (red) or not (black).")

According with the results (fig. 18), there are not statistically significant differences in specific splicing type events between both experimental conditions. However, this result is affected by the fact that we are using only a fraction of the total data (remember that we subsampled the origital datasets in order to speed up the analysis).

#### Analysis of consequence enrichment

To analyze large-scale patterns in predicted {IS} consequences, **IsoformSwitchAnalyzer** computes all {IS} events resulting in a gain/loss of a specific consequence (e.g. protein domain gain/loss) when comparing cancer and ctrl (fig. 20). According the results some types of functional consequences seem to be enriched or depleted between health and tumoral samples (e.g. intron retention).

![Figure 20. Summary of genome-wide enrichment/depletion o isoform switching events](../../images/differential_isoform/isoformSwitchAnalyzer_consequences_features.png "Analysis of consequence enrichment. Number of isoforms significantly differentially used between cancer and health resulting in at least one isoform switch consequence.")

To assess this observation, a standard proportion test is performed (fig. 21). The results indicate that differences in intron retention between health and cancer samples is statistically significant).

![Figure 20. Enrichment/depletion isoform switch analysis](../../images/differential_isoform/isoformSwitchAnalyzer_consequences_isoform.png "Enrichment/depletion in isoform switches consequences. The x-axis shows the fraction (with 95% confidence interval) resulting in the consequence indicated by y axis, in the switches from cancer to control. Dashed line indicate no enrichment/depletion. Color indicate if FDR < 0.05 (red) or not (black).")

According with the results (fig. 21), there are not statistically significant differences of IS consequences despite the apparent differentes in total event counts. However, as noted previously, in that case it is due to the small size of the datasets used.

#### Analysis of genome-wide changes in isoform usage

Finally, we will evaluate the genome-wide changes in isoform usage. This type of analysis allows to identify if differentes in splicing events are genome-wide or retricted to specific regions, and is particular interesting if the expected difference between conditions is large (fig. 24).

![Figure 24. Genome-wide changes violing plot](../../images/differential_isoform/isoformSwitchAnalyzer_summary.png "Genome-wide changes violin plot. The the dots in the violin plots above indicate 25th, 50th (median) and 75th percentiles.")

As expected from the previous results, in that case there are not statistically significant genome-wide differences in splicing events.

# Optional exercise: original data analysis

As additional activity, you can try to run the pipeline by using the original datasets. In that case we will make use of the Galaxy Workflow System, which will allow us to automatize the analysis by minimizing the number of required manual steps.

# Conclusion

Despite the large amount of RNA-seq data and computational methods available, isoform-based expression analysis is rare. Here we present a pipeline for  the statistical identification and analysis of splicing event and {IS} events with predicted functional consequences.
