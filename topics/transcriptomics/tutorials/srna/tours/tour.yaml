  - title: Introduction
    content: >-
      Small, noncoding RNA (sRNA) molecules, typically 18-40nt in length, are
      key features of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms governing gene
      expression. Through interactions with protein cofactors, these tiny sRNAs
      typically function by perfectly or imperfectly basepairing with substrate
      RNA molecules, and then eliciting downstream effects such as translation
      inhibition or RNA degradation. Different subclasses of sRNAs - e.g.
      microRNAs (miRNAs), Piwi-interaction RNAs (piRNAs), and endogenous short
      interferring RNAs (siRNAs) - exhibit unique characteristics, and their
      relative abundances in biological contexts can indicate whether they are
      active or not.

  - title: Introduction
    content: >-
      The data used in this tutorial are from polyphosphatase-treated sRNA
      sequencing (sRNA-seq) experiments in <i>Drosophila</i>. The goal of this
      study was to determine how siRNA expression changes in flies treated with
      RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down Symplekin, which is a component of
      the core cleaveage completx. To that end, in addition to sRNA-seq,
      mRNA-seq experiments were performed to determine whether targets of
      differentially expressed siRNAs were also differentially expressed. The
      original published study can be found <a
      href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28415970">here</a>. Because of
      the long processing time for the large original files - which contained
      7-22 million reads each - we have downsampled the original input data to
      include only a subset of usable reads.

  - title: Analysis strategy
    content: >-
      In this exercise we will identify what small RNAs are present in
      <i>Drosophila</i> Dmel-2 tissue culture cells treated with either RNAi
      against core cleavage complex component Symplekin or blank (control) RNAi
      (published data available in GEO at <a
      href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE82128">GSE82128</a>).
      In this study, biological triplicate sRNA- and mRNA-seq libraries were
      sequenced for both RNAi conditions. After removing contaminant ribosomal
      RNA (rRNA) and miRNA reads, we will identify and quantify endogenous
      siRNAs from sequenced reads and test for differential abundance. We will
      follow a popular small RNA analysis pipeline developed for piRNAs by the
      Phillip Zamore Lab and the ZLab (Zhiping Weng) at UMass Med School called
      <a href="https://github.com/bowhan/piPipes">PiPipes</a>. Although PiPipes
      was developed for analysis of piRNAs, many of the basical principles can
      be applied to other classes of small RNAs. <br><br>It is of note that this
      tutorial uses datasets that have been de-multiplexed so that the input
      data files are a single FASTQ formatted file for each sample. Because
      sRNAs are typically much smaller than fragments generated for RNA-seq or
      other types of deep sequencing experiments, single-end sequencing
      strategies are almost always used to sequence sRNAs. This tutorial uses
      the Collections feature of Galaxy to orgainze each set of replicates into
      a single group, making tool form submission easier and ensuring
      reproducibility.

    content: >-
      Read quality scores (phred scores) in FASTQ-formatted data can be encoded
      by one of a few different encoding schemes. Most Galaxy tools assume that
      input FASTQ files are using the Sanger/Illumina 1.9 encoding scheme. If
      the input FASTQ files are using an alternate encoding scheme, then some
      tools will not interpret the quality score encodings correctly. It is good
      practice to confirm the quality encoding scheme of your data and then
      convert to Sanger/Illumina 1.9, if necessary. We can check the quality
      encoding scheme using the <a
      href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">FastQC</a>
      tool (further described in the <a

      Check the FASTQC output and scroll down to the “Adapter Content” section.
      You can see that Illumina Universal Adapters are present in <b>>80%</b> of
      the reads. The next step is to remove these artificial adaptors because
      they are not part of the biological sRNAs. If a different adapter is
      present, you can update the <b>Adapter sequence to be trimmed off</b> in
      the Trim Galore!
    position: left
  - title: Adaptor trimming
    content: >-
      sRNA-seq library preparation involves adding an artificial adaptor
      sequence to both the 5’ and 3’ ends of the small RNAs. While the 5’
      adaptor anchors reads to the sequencing surface and thus are not
      sequenced, the 3’ adaptor is typically sequenced immediately following the
      sRNA sequence. In the example datasets here, the 3’ adaptor sequence is
      identified as the Illumina Universal Adapter, and needs to be removed from
      each read before aligning to a reference. We will be using the Galaxy tool
      Trim Galore! which implements the <a
      href="https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">cutadapt</a> tool for

      <br><br>We don’t want to trim for quality because the adapter-trimmed
      sequences represent a full small RNA molecule, and we want to maintain the
      integrity of the entire molecule. We increase the minimum read length
      required to keep a read because small RNAs can potentially be shorter than
      20 nt (the default value). We can check out the generated report file for
      any sample and see the command for the tool, a summary of the total reads
      processed and number of reads with an adapter identified, and histogram
      data of the length of adaptor trimmed. We also see that a very small

      An interesting thing to note from our FastQC results is the Sequence
      Length Distribution results. While many RNA-seq experiments have normal
      distribution of read lengths, an unusual spike at 22nt is observed in our
      data. This spike represents the large set of endogenous siRNAs that occur
      in the cell line used in this study, and is actually confirmation that our
      dataset captures the biological molecule we are interested in.

      Now that we have converted to fastqsanger format and trimmed our reads of
      the Illumina Universal Adaptors, we will align our trimmed reads to
      reference Drosophila rRNA and miRNA sequences (dm3) to remove these
      artifacts. Interestingly, Drosophila have a short 2S rRNA sequence that is
      30nt long and typically co-migrates with sRNA populations during gel
      electrophoresis. rRNAs make up a very large proportion of all non-coding
      RNAs, and thus need to be removed. Oftentimes, experimental approaches can
      be utilized to deplete or avoid capture of rRNAs, but these methods are
      not always 100% efficient. We also want to remove any miRNA sequences, as
      these are not relevant to our analysis. After removing rRNA and miRNA
      reads, we will analyze the remaining reads, which may be siRNA or piRNA
      sequences.

      For this tutorial we are not interested in miRNA reads, so we need to
      extract <i>unaligned</i> reads from the output BAM files. To do this,
      repeat the <b>Filter SAM or BAM, output SAM or BAM</b> and <b>Convert from
      BAM to FastQ</b> steps for each dataset collection. Finally, rename the
      converted FASTQ files something meaningful (e.g. “non-r/miRNA control RNAi
      sRNA-seq”).

      <br>In some instances, miRNA-aligned reads are the desired output for
      downstream analyses, for example, if we are investigating how loss of key
      miRNA pathway components affect levels of pre-miRNA and mature miRNAs. In
      this case, the BAM output of HISAT2 can directly be used in subsequent
      tools as it contains the subset of reads aligned to miRNA sequences.

      The regular expression in the <b>Match by</b> parameter tells the tool to
      identify sequences that are length 12-19 or 23-50 (inclusive), and the

      these sequences. What remains are sequences of length 20-22nt. We will now

      (23-29nt).

      Inspect the outputs. You should notice that we have ~32k reads that are
      20-22nt long in our Reads_20-22_nt_length_siRNAs file and ~16k reads that
      are 23-29nt long in our Reads_23-29_nt_length_piRNAs file, as expected.
      Given that we had ~268k trimmed reads in the Blank RNAi replicate 3 file,
      siRNAs represent ~12.1% of the reads and piRNAs represent ~6.2% of the
      reads in this experiment. There is no distinct peak in the piRNA range (
      you can find the example of the real piRNA profile in Figure 1 from [Colin
      D. Malone et al, 2009](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2009.03.040)).

      The next step in our analysis pipeline is to identify which RNA features -
      e.g. protein-coding mRNAs, transposable elements - the siRNAs and piRNAs
      align to. Most fly piRNAs originate from and thus align to transposable
      elements (TEs) but some also originate from genome piRNA clusters or
      protein-coding genes. siRNAs are thought to inhibit TE mobility and
      potentially target mRNAs for degradation via an RNA-interference (RNAi)
      mechanism. Ultimately, we want to know whether an RNA feature (TE, piRNA
      cluster, mRNA, etc.) has significantly different numbers of siRNAs or
      piRNAs targeting it. To determine this, we will use <b>Salmon</b> to
      simultaneously align and quantify siRNA reads against known target
      sequences to estimate siRNA abundance per target. For the remainder of the
      tutorial we will be focusing on siRNAs, but similar approaches can be done
      for piRNAs, miRNAs, or any other subclass of small, non-coding RNAs.

      We want to identify which siRNAs are differentially abundance between the
      blank and Symplekin RNAi conditions. To do this we will implement a
      counting approach using <b>Salmon</b> to quantify siRNAs per RNA feature.
      Specifically, we will analyzing mRNA and TE elements by counting siRNAs
      against a FASTA file of transcript sequences, not the reference genome.
      This approach is especially useful in this case because we are interested
      in TEs, which occur at many copies (100s - 1000s) in the genome, and thus
      will result in multiple alignments if we align to the genome with a tool
      like <b>HISAT2</b>. Further, we will be counting abundance of siRNAs that
      align sense or antisense to an RNA feature independently, as opposite
      sense alignments are correlated with unique downstream silencing effects.
      Then, we will provide this information to <b>DESeq2</b> to generate
      normalized counts and significance testing for differential abundance of
      siRNAs per feature.

      Analysis of small RNAs is a complicated and intricate process due to the
      diversity in characteristics, functionality, and nuances of small RNA
      subclasses. The goal of this tutorial is to introduce you to a common
      small RNA workflow that specifically identifies changes in endogenous
      siRNA abundances that target protein-coding mRNAs and transposable
      elements. The steps presented here can be rearranged and modified based on
      small RNA features of specific systems and the needs of the user.
