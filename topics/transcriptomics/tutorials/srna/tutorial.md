# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

Small, noncoding RNA (sRNA) molecules, typically 18-40nt in length, are key features of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms governing gene expression. Through interactions with protein cofactors, these tiny sRNAs typically function by perfectly or imperfectly basepairing with substrate RNA molecules, and then eliciting downstream effects such as translation inhibition or RNA degradation. Different subclasses of sRNAs - *e.g.* microRNAs (miRNAs), Piwi-interaction RNAs (piRNAs), and endogenous short interferring RNAs (siRNAs) - exhibit unique characteristics, and their relative abundances in biological contexts can indicate whether they are active or not. In this tutorial, we will examine expression of the piRNA subclass of sRNAs and their targets in *Drosophila melanogaster*.

The data used in this tutorial are from polyphosphatase-treated sRNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) experiments in *Drosophila*. The goal of this study was to determine how siRNA expression changes in flies treated with RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down Symplekin, which is a component of the core cleaveage completx. To that end, in addition to sRNA-seq, mRNA-seq experiments were performed to determine whether targets of differentially expressed siRNAs were also differentially expressed. The original published study can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28415970). Because of the long processing time for the large original files - which contained 7-22 million reads each - we have downsampled the original input data to include only a subset of usable reads.

# Analysis strategy

In this exercise we will identify what small RNAs are present in *Drosophila* Dmel-2 tissue culture cells treated with either RNAi against  core cleavage complex component Symplekin or blank (control) RNAi (published data available in GEO at [GSE82128](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE82128)). In this study, biological triplicate sRNA- and mRNA-seq libraries were sequenced for both RNAi conditions. After removing contaminant ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and miRNA reads, we will identify and quantify endogenous siRNAs from sequenced reads and test for differential abundance. We will follow a popular small RNA analysis pipeline developed for piRNAs by the Phillip Zamore Lab and the ZLab (Zhiping Weng) at UMass Med School called [PiPipes](https://github.com/bowhan/piPipes). Although PiPipes was developed for analysis of piRNAs, many of the basical principles can be applied to other classes of small RNAs.

It is of note that this tutorial uses datasets that have been de-multiplexed so that the input data files are a single FASTQ formatted file for each sample. Because sRNAs are typically much smaller than fragments generated for RNA-seq or other types of deep sequencing experiments, single-end sequencing strategies are almost always used to sequence sRNAs. This tutorial uses the *Collections* feature of Galaxy to orgainze each set of replicates into a single group, making tool form submission easier and ensuring reproducibility.

## Data upload and organization

Due to the large size of the original sRNA-seq datasets, we have downsampled them to only inlcude a subset of reads. These datasets are avaialble at [`Zenodo`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.826906) where you can find the FASTQ files corresponding to replicate sRNA-seq experiments and additional annotation files for the *Drosophila melanogaster* genome version dm3.

## Read quality checking

Read quality scores (phred scores) in FASTQ-formatted data can be encoded by one of a few different encoding schemes. Most Galaxy tools assume that input FASTQ files are using the Sanger/Illumina 1.9 encoding scheme. If the input FASTQ files are using an alternate encoding scheme, then some tools will not interpret the quality score encodings correctly. It is good practice to confirm the quality encoding scheme of your data and then convert to Sanger/Illumina 1.9, if necessary. We can check the quality encoding scheme using the [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) tool (further described in the [NGS-QC tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/sequence-analysis)).

*If you are following this tutorial OR your data were already in Sanger / Illumina 1.9 format*: Changes the datatype of each input file to 'fastqsanger'.

*If your data were not in Sanger / Illumina 1.9 format*: After `FASTQ Groomer` finishes, click on the groomed dataset collection name and then click on the name of one of the datasets. You should see that the format is **fastqsanger** instead of **fastq**, meaning you have successfully converted the quality score encoding scheme.

Go back to the `FASTQC` output and scroll down to the "Adapter Content" section. You can see that Illumina Universal Adapters are present in **>80%** of the reads. The next step is to remove these artificial adaptors because they are not part of the biological sRNAs. If a different adapter is present, you can update the **Adapter sequence to be trimmed off** in the `Trim Galore!` step described below.

## Adaptor trimming

sRNA-seq library preparation involves adding an artificial adaptor sequence to both the 5' and 3' ends of the small RNAs. While the 5' adaptor anchors reads to the sequencing surface and thus are not sequenced, the 3' adaptor is typically sequenced immediately following the sRNA sequence. In the example datasets here, the 3' adaptor sequence is identified as the Illumina Universal Adapter, and needs to be removed from each read before aligning to a reference. We will be using the Galaxy tool `Trim Galore!` which implements the [`cutadapt`](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) tool for adapter trimming.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Adaptor trimming

>    We don't want to trim for quality because the adapter-trimmed sequences represent a full small RNA molecule, and we want to maintain the integrity of the entire molecule. We increase the minimum read length required to keep a read because small RNAs can potentially be shorter than 20 nt (the default value). We can check out the generated report file for any sample and see the command for the tool, a summary of the total reads processed and number of reads with an adapter identified, and histogram data of the length of adaptor trimmed. We also see that a very small percentage of low-quality bases have been trimmed

{: .hands_on}

An interesting thing to note from our `FastQC` results is the *Sequence Length Distribution* results. While many RNA-seq experiments have normal distribution of read lengths, an unusual spike at 22nt is observed in our data. This spike represents the large set of endogenous siRNAs that occur in the cell line used in this study, and is actually confirmation that our dataset captures the biological molecule we are interested in.

Now that we have converted to *fastqsanger* format and trimmed our reads of the Illumina Universal Adaptors, we will align our trimmed reads to reference *Drosophila* rRNA and miRNA sequences (dm3) to remove these artifacts. Interestingly, *Drosophila* have a short 2S rRNA sequence that is 30nt long and typically co-migrates with sRNA populations during gel electrophoresis. rRNAs make up a very large proportion of all non-coding RNAs, and thus need to be removed. Oftentimes, experimental approaches can be utilized to deplete or avoid capture of rRNAs, but these methods are not always 100% efficient. We also want to remove any miRNA sequences, as these are not relevant to our analysis. After removing rRNA and miRNA reads, we will analyze the remaining reads as siRNA and piRNA sequences.

## Hierarchical read alignment to remove rRNA/miRNA reads

To first identify rRNA-originating reads (which we are not interested in in this case), we will align the reads to a reference set of rRNA sequences using [`HISAT2`](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml), an accurate and fast tool for aligning reads to a reference.

> 1. Repeat for the *Symplekin* RNAi dataset collection
>
>    We now need to extract the *unaligned* reads from the output BAM file for aligning to reference miRNA sequences. We can do this by using the `Filter SAM or BAM, output SAM or BAM` tool to obtain reads with a bit flag = 4 (meaning the read is unaligned) and then converting the filtered BAM file to FASTQ format with the `Convert from BAM to FastQ` tool.

Finally, rename the converted FASTQ files something meaningful (*e.g.* "non-r/miRNA control RNAi sRNA-seq").

## Small RNA subclass distinction

In *Drosophila*, non-miRNA small RNAs are typically divided into two major groups: endogenous siRNAs which are 20-22nt long and piRNAs which are 23-29nt long. We want to analyze these sRNA subclasses independently, so next we are going to filter the non-r/miRNA reads based on length using the `Manipulate FASTQ` tool.

>    The regular expression in the **Match by** parameter tells the tool to identify sequences that are length 12-19 or 23-50 (inclusive), and the **Miscellaneous Manipulation Type** parameter tells the tool to remove these sequences.

> We see in the above image (for Blank RNAi, replicate 3) that we have ~32k reads that are 20-22nt long in our Reads_20-22_nt_length_siRNAs file and ~16k reads that are 23-29nt long in our Reads_23-29_nt_length_piRNAs file, as expected. Given that we had ~268k trimmed reads in the Blank RNAi replicate 3 file, siRNAs represent ~12.1% of the reads and piRNAs represent ~6.2% of the reads in this experiment.

{: .hands_on}

The next step in our analysis pipeline is to identify which RNA features - e.g. protein-coding mRNAs, transposable elements - the siRNAs and piRNAs align to. Most fly piRNAs originate from and thus align to transposable elements (TEs) but some also originate from genome piRNA clusters or protein-coding genes. siRNAs are thought to inhibit TE mobility and potentially target mRNAs for degradation via an RNA-interference (RNAi) mechanism. Ultimately, we want to know whether an RNA feature (TE, piRNA cluster, mRNA, etc.) has significantly different numbers of siRNAs or piRNAs targeting it. To determine this, we will use `Salmon` to simultaneously align and quantify siRNA reads against known target sequences to estimate siRNA abundance per target. For the remainder of the tutorial we will be focusing on siRNAs, but similar approaches can be done for piRNAs, miRNAs, or any other subclass of small, non-coding RNAs.

## siRNA abundance estimation

We want to identify which siRNAs are differentially abundance between the blank and *Symplekin* RNAi conditions. To do this we will implement a counting approach using `Salmon` to quantify siRNAs per RNA feature. Specifically, we will analyzing mRNA and TE elements by counting siRNAs against a FASTA file of transcript sequences, not the reference genome. This approach is especially useful in this case because we are interested in TEs, which occur at many copies (100s - 1000s) in the genome, and thus will result in multiple alignments if we align to the genome with a tool like `HISAT2`. Further, we will be counting abundance of siRNAs that align *sense* or *antisense* to an RNA feature independently, as opposite sense alignments are correlated with unique downstream silencing effects. Then, we will provide this information to `DESeq2` to generate normalized counts and significance testing for differential abundance of siRNAs per feature.

>
> 1. **Salmon** {% icon tool %}: Run `Salmon` on each collection of siRNA reads (20-22nt) to quantify the abundance of *antisense* siRNAs at relevant targets. We will focus on abundance of siRNAs on mRNAs and transposable elements using the following parameters:

> 1. **Salmon** {% icon tool %}: Repeat step 1 on each collection of siRNA reads (20-22nt) to quantify the abundance of *sense* siRNAs at relevant targets by changing the following parameters:
>    - **Specify the strandedness of the reads**: read 1 (or single-end read) comes from the forward strand (SF)
> 1. Repeat `Salmon` for the *Symplekin* RNAi siRNAs (20-22nt) reads dataset collection
>
{: .hands_on}

The output of `Salmon` includes a table of RNA features, estimated counts, transcripts per million, and feature length. We will be using the TPM quantification column as input to `DESeq2` in the next section.

## siRNA differential abundance testing

[`DESeq2`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) is a great tool for differential expression analysis, but we also employ it here for estimation of abundance of reads targeting each of our RNA features. As input, `DESeq2` can take *t*ranscripts *p*er *m*illion (TPM) counts produced by `Salmon` for each feature. TPMs are estimates of the relative abundance of a given transcript in units, and analogously can be used here to quantify siRNAs that align either sense or antisense to transcripts.

## Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

Analysis of small RNAs is a complicated and intricate process due to the diversity in characteristics, functionality, and nuances of small RNA subclasses. The goal of this tutorial is to introduce you to a common small RNA workflow that specifically identifies changes in endogenous siRNA abundances that target protein-coding mRNAs and transposable elements. The steps presented here can be rearranged and modified based on small RNA features of specific systems and the needs of the user.
