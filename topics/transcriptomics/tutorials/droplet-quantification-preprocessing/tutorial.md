# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

<!-- This is a comment. -->

This tutorial will take you from raw FASTQ files to a cell x gene data matrix in AnnData format. What's a data matrix, and what's AnnData format? Well you'll find out! Importantly, this is the first step in processing single cell data in order to start analysing it. Currently you have a bunch of strings of `ATGGGCTT` etc. in your sequencing files, and what you need to know is how many cells you have and what genes appear in those cells. In the second part of this tutorial, we will also look at combining FASTQ files and adding in metadata (for instance, SEX or GENOTYPE) for analysis later on. These steps are the most computationally heavy in the single cell world, as you're starting with 100s of millions of reads, each 4 lines of text. Later on in analysis this data becomes simple gene counts such as 'Cell A has 4 GAPDHs', which is a lot easier to store! Because of this data overload, we have downsampled the FASTQ files to speed up the analysis a bit. Saying that, you're still having to map loads of reads to the massive murine genome, so get yourself a cup of coffee and prepare to analyse!

# Generating a matrix

In this section, we will show you the principles of the initial phase of single-cell RNA-seq analysis: generating expression measures in a matrix. We'll concentrate on droplet-based (rather than plate-based) methodology, since this is the process with most differences with respect to conventional approaches developed for bulk RNA-seq.

Droplet-based data consists of three components: cell barcodes, unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and cDNA reads. To generate cell-wise quantifications we need to:

 * Process cell barcodes, working out which ones correspond to 'real' cells, which to sequencing artefacts, and possibly correct any barcodes likely to be the product of sequencing errors by comparison to more frequent sequences.
 * Map biological sequences to the reference genome or transcriptome.
 * 'De-duplicate' using the UMIs.

This used to be a complex process involving multiple algorithms, or was performed with technology-specific methods (such as 10X's 'Cellranger' tool)  but is now much simpler thanks to the advent of a few new methods. When selecting methodology for your own work you should consider:

 * [STARsolo](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) - a droplet-based scRNA-seq-specific variant of the popular genome alignment method STAR. Produces results very close to those of Cellranger (which itself uses STAR under the hood).
 * [Kallisto/ bustools](https://www.kallistobus.tools/) - developed by the originators of the transcriptome quantification method, Kallisto.
 * [Alevin](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/alevin.html) - another transcriptome analysis method developed by the authors of the Salmon tool.

We're going to use Alevin {% cite article-Alevin %} for demonstration purposes, but we do not endorse one method over another.

## Get Data

We've provided you with some example data to play with, a small subset of the reads in a mouse dataset of fetal growth restriction {% cite Bacon2018 %} (see the study in Single Cell Expression Atlas [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6945/results/tsne) and the project submission [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6945/)). This is a study using the Drop-seq chemistry, however this tutorial is almost identical to a 10x chemistry. We will point out the one tool parameter change you will need to run 10x samples. This data is not carefully curated, standard tutorial data - it's real, it's messy, it desperately needs filtering, it has background RNA running around, and most of all it will give you a chance to practice your analysis as if this data were yours.

Down-sampled reads and some associated annotation can be downloaded from Zenodo below, or you can import this [example input history](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/h/input---pre-processing-with-alevin). How did I downsample these FASTQ files? Check out [this history](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/h/pre-processing-with-alevin---part-1---how-to-downsample) to find out!
Additionally, to map your reads, you will need a transcriptome to align against (a FASTA) as well as the gene information for each transcript (a gtf) file. You can download these for your species of interest from Ensembl [here](https://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html). Additionally, these files are available in the above history as well as the Zenodo links below. Keep in mind, these are big files, so they may take a bit to import!

## Generate a transcript to gene map

Gene-level, rather than transcript-level, quantification is standard in scRNA-seq, which means that the expression level of alternatively spliced RNA molecules are combined to create gene-level values. Droplet-based scRNA-seq techniques only sample one end each transcript, so lack the full-molecule coverage that would be required to accurately quantify different transcript isoforms.

To generate gene-level quantifications based on transcriptome quantification, Alevin and similar tools require a conversion between transcript and gene identifiers. We can derive a transcript-gene conversion from the gene annotations available in genome resources such as Ensembl. The transcripts in such a list need to match the ones we will use later to build a binary transcriptome index. If you were using spike-ins, you'd need to add these to the transcriptome and the transcript-gene mapping.

In your example data you will see the murine reference annotation as retrieved from Ensembl in GTF format. This annotation contains gene, exon, transcript and all sorts of other information on the sequences. We will use these to generate the transcript/ gene mapping by passing that information to a tool that extracts just the transcript identifiers we need.

{: .question}

It's now time to parse the GTF file using the [rtracklayer](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rtracklayer.html) package in R. This parsing will give us a conversion table with a list of transcript identifiers and their corresponding gene identifiers for counting. Additionally, because we will be generating our own binary index (more later!), we also need to input our FASTA so that it can be filtered to only contain transcriptome information found in the GTF.

## Generate a transcriptome index & quantify!

Alevin collapses the steps involved in dealing with dscRNA-seq into a single process. Such tools need to compare the sequences in your sample to a reference containing all the likely transcript sequences (a 'transcriptome'). This will contain the biological transcript sequences known for a given species, and perhaps also technical sequences such as 'spike ins' if you have those.

> ### {% icon details %} How does Alevin work?
>
> To be able to search a transcriptome quickly, Alevin needs to convert the text (FASTA) format sequences into something it can search quickly, called an 'index'. The index is in a binary rather than human-readable format, but allows fast lookup by Alevin. Because the types of biological and technical sequences we need to include in the index can vary between experiments, and because we often want to use the most up-to-date reference sequences from Ensembl or NCBI, we can end up re-making the indices quite often. Making these indices is time-consuming! Have a look at the uncompressed FASTA to see what it starts with.

We now have:

* Barcode/ UMI reads
* cDNA reads
* transcript/ gene mapping
* filtered FASTA

We can now run Alevin. In some public instances, Alevin won't show up if you search for it. Instead, you have to click the Single Cell tab at the left and scroll down to the Alevin tool. Tip: If you click the tools from the tutorial option within Galaxy, you'll always have the correct version of the tool! In this case, it is: (Galaxy Version 1.3.0+galaxy2) - it should be default. If not, click 'Versions' and choose that version.

This tool will take a while to run. Alevin produces many file outputs, not all of which we'll use. You can refer to the [Alevin documentation](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/alevin.html) if you're curious what they all are, but we're most interested in is:

* the matrix itself (quants_mat.mtx.gz - the count by gene and cell)
* the row (cell/ barcode) identifiers (quants_mat_rows.txt) and
* the column (gene) labels (quants_mat_cols.txt).

This is the matrix market (MTX) format.

Remember this was downsampled, and specifically by taking only the last 400,000 reads of the FASTQ file. The overall mapping rate of the file is more like 50%, which is still quite poor, but for early Drop-Seq samples and single-cell data in general, you might expect a slightly poorer mapping rate. 10x samples are much better these days! This is real data, not test data, after all!

{% icon congratulations %} Congratulations - you've made an expression matrix! We could almost stop here. But it's sensible to do some basic QC, and one of the things we can do is look at a barcode rank plot.

# Basic QC

The question we're looking to answer here, is: "do we have mostly a have a single cell per droplet"? That's what experimenters are normally aiming for, but it's not entirely straightforward to get exactly one cell per droplet. Sometimes almost no cells make it into droplets, other times we have too many cells in each droplet. At a minimum, we should easily be able to distinguish droplets with cells from those without.

![raw droplet barcode plots-400k](../../images/wab-raw_barcodes-400k.png "400k subsample raw")

Now, the image generated here (400k) isn't the most informative - but you are dealing with a fraction of the reads! If you run the total sample (so identical steps above, but with significantly more time!) you'd get the image below.

![raw droplet barcode plots-total](../../images/wab-raw_barcodes-total.png "Total sample - 32,579,453 reads - raw")

This is our own formulation of the barcode plot based on a [discussion](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/362#issuecomment-490160480) we had with community members. The left hand plots with the smooth lines are the main plots, showing the UMI counts for individual cell barcodes ranked from high to low. We expect a sharp drop-off between cell-containing droplets and ones that are empty or contain only cell debris. Now, this data is not an ideal dataset, so for perspective, in an ideal world with a very clean 10x run, data will look a bit more like the following taken from the lung atlas (see the study in Single Cell Expression Atlas [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6653/results/tsne) and the project submission [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6653/)).

![raw droplet barcode plots - lung atlas](../../images/wab-lung-atlas-barcodes-raw.png "Pretty data - raw")

In that plot, you can see the clearer 'knee' bend, showing the cut-off between empty droplets and cell-containing droplets.

The right hand plots are density plots from the first one, and the thresholds are generated either using [dropletUtils](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DropletUtils.html) or by the method described in the discussion mentioned above. We could use any of these thresholds to select cells, assuming that anything with fewer counts is not a valid cell. By default, Alevin does something similar, and we can learn something about that by plotting just the barcodes Alevin retains.

And the full sample looks like:

![raw droplet barcode plots - total](../../images/wab-alevin-barcodes-total.png "Total sample - 32,579,453 reads - Alevin processed")

And to round this off, here's the lung atlas plot.

![raw droplet barcode plots - total](../../images/wab-alevin-barcodes-lung.png "Pretty data - Alevin processed")

You should see a completely vertical drop-off where Alevin has trunctated the distribution (after excluding any cell barcode that had <10 UMI, Alevin then chose a threshold based off the curve and removed all barcodes with fewer UMIs).

In experiments with relatively simple characteristics, this 'knee detection' method works relatively well. But some populations (such as our sample!) present difficulties. For instance, sub-populations of small cells may not be distinguished from empty droplets based purely on counts by barcode. Some libraries produce multiple 'knees' for multiple sub-populations. The [emptyDrops](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1662-y) method has become a popular way of dealing with this. emptyDrops still retains barcodes with very high counts, but also adds in barcodes that can be statistically distinguished from the ambient profiles, even if total counts are similar. In order to ultimately run emptyDrops (or indeed, whatever tool you like that accomplishes biologically relevant thresholding), we first need to re-run Alevin, but prevent it from applying its own less than ideal thresholds.

To use emptyDrops effectively, we need to go back and re-run Alevin, stopping it from applying it's own thresholds. Click the re-run icon {% icon galaxy-refresh %} on any Alevin output in your history, because almost every parameter is the same as before, except you need to change the following:

Alevin outputs MTX format, which we can pass to the dropletUtils package and run emptyDrops. Unfortunately the matrix is in the wrong orientation for tools expecting files like those produced by 10X software (which dropletUtils does). We need to 'transform' the matrix such that cells are in columns and genes are in rows.

The output is a matrix in the correct orientation for the rest of our tools. However, our matrix is looking a bit sparse - for instance, click on `Gene table`. I don't know about you, but I'd struggle to have a good biological discussion using only Ensembl gene_ids! What I'd really like is the more understandable 'GAPDH' or other gene acronym, as well as information on mitochondrial genes so that I can assess if my cells were stressed out or not. In order to prepare our data for emptyDrops, we're going to combine this information into an object, and it's easiest to add in that information now.

Inspect {% icon galaxy-eye %} the **Gene Information** object in the history. Now you have made a new key for gene_id, with gene name and a column of mitochondrial information (false = not mitochondrial, true = mitochondrial). We need to add this information into the salmonKallistoMtxTo10x output 'Gene table'. But we need to keep 'Gene table' in the same order, since it is referenced in the 'Matrix table' by row.

Inspect {% icon galaxy-eye %} your `Annotated Gene Table`. That's more like it! You now have `gene_id`, `gene_name`, and `mito`. Now let's get back to your journey to emptyDrops and sophisticated thresholding of empty droplets!

# emptyDrops

emptyDrops {% cite article-emptyDrops %} works with a specific form of R object called a SingleCellExperiment. We need to convert our transformed MTX files into that form, using the DropletUtils Read10x tool:

Fantastic! Now that our matrix is combined into an object, specifically the SingleCellExperiment format, we can now run emptyDrops! Let's get rid of those background droplets containing no cells!

If you look at the barcode plots above for the 400k read sample, you'll see this is far too stringent for this subsampled data! To satisfy your curiosity, this minimum threshold would yield `3011` barcodes for the total sample. Also, the number may vary slightly as the output depends on a large number of random iterations.

Let's go back and tweak parameters, re-running the tool with a looser threshold minimum.

You should now have `111` barcodes! You now have an annotated expression matrix ready to go for further processing and analysis! Well done! However, the next tutorials we will link to use a tool called Scanpy.

{% icon congratulations %} Congrats! Your object is ready to for the scanpy pipeline! You can can check your work against the [example history](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/h/pre-processing-with-alevin---part-1---answer-key).

However, it may be that you want to combine this object with others like it, for instance, maybe you ran 5 samples, and you are starting with 10 FASTQ files...

# Combining FASTQ files

This sample was originally one of seven. So to run the other [12 downsampled FASTQ files](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/h/alevin-tutorial---all-samples---400k), you can use a [workflow](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/w/pre-processing-with-alevin---part-1-imported-from-uploaded-file)! Note - the N705 subsample is unluckily largely junk reads, so emptyDrops doesn't work. Instead, I processed it with Alevin. The total sample runs fine on emptyDrops of course. All these samples are going to take a while, so go and have several cups of tea... Or, better yet, I have [run them myself](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/h/pre-processing-with-alevin---part-2---input-generation), and plopped them in a [new clean history](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/h/pre-processing-with-alevin---part-2---input) for you to import as a fresh history. Alternatively, you can get data with zenodo.

Inspect the {% icon galaxy-eye %} `Experimental Design` text file. This shows you how each `N70X` corresponds to a sample, and whether that sample was from a male or female. This will be important metadata to add to our sample, which we will add very similarly to how you added the `gene_name` and `mito` metadata above!

Now let's look at what we've done! Unfortunately, AnnData objects are quite complicated, so the {% icon galaxy-eye %} won't help us too much here. Instead, we're going to use a tool to look into our object from now on.

The tool version in this course has the `9th` column at the farthest right is `batch`. Batch refers to the order in which the matrices were added. The files are added from the bottom of the history upwards, so be careful how you set up your histories when running this!
> {: .solution}

{: .question}

# Adding batch metadata

I set up the example history with the earliest indices at the bottom.

![Ordered history](../../images/wab-history-files-ascending.png "Note how N701 is lowest, ordered ascending to N707")

Therefore, when it is all concatenated together, the `batch` appears as follows:

| Index | Batch | Genotype | Sex |
|------ |--------------------|
| N701 | 0    | wildtype    | male    |
| N702 | 1    | knockout   | male    |
| N703 | 2    | knockout   | female    |
| N704 | 3    | wildtype    | male    |
| N705 | 4    | wildtype    | male    |
| N706 | 5    | wildtype    | male    |
| N707 | 6    | knockout    | male    |

If you used Zenodo to import files, they may not have imported in order (i.e. N701 to N707, ascending). In that case, you will need to tweak the parameters of the next tools appropriately to label your batches correctly!

The two critical pieces of metadata in this experiment are **sex** and **genotype**. I will later want to color my cell plots by these parameters, so I want to add them in now!

You might want to do this with all sorts of different metadata - which labs handled the samples, which days they were run, etc. Once you've added created all your metadata columns, we can add them together before plugging them into the AnnData object itself.

Woohoo! We're there! You can run an **Inspect AnnData** to check now, but I want to clean up this AnnData object just a bit more first. It would be a lot nicer if 'batch' meant something, rather than 'the order in which the Manipulate AnnData tool added my datasets'.

Huzzah! We are JUST about there. However, while we've been focussing on our cell metadata (sample, batch, genotype, etc.) to relabel the 'observations' in our object...

# Mitochondrial reads

Do you remember when we mentioned mitochondria early on in this tutorial? And how often in single cell samples, mitochondrial RNA is often an indicator of stress during dissociation? We should probably do something with our column of true/false in the gene annotation that tells us information about the cells. You will need to do this whether you have combined FASTQ files or are analysing just one (and thus skipping sections 4 & 5).

{% icon congratulations %}Well done!

# Pulling single cell data from public resources

It's important to note that this matrix is processed somewhat through the SCXA pipeline, which is quite similar to this tutorial, and it contains any and all metadata provided by their pipeline as well as the authors (for instance, more cell or gene annotations).

You may be interested in seeing an [example history](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/h/pre-processing-with-alevin---part-2---answer-key-1) and [Part 2 workflow](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/w/pre-processing-with-alevin---part-2). Note that the workflow will require changing of the `column` containing the batch metadata depending on how you are running it. The final object containing all the reads can be found in [here](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/wendi.bacon.training/h/pre-processing-with-alevin---part-2---total-anndata-example).

We have:

 * Taken raw read data and annotations and necessary input files for quantification.
 * Run Alevin in two different parameterisations, both allowing Alevin to make its own calls on what constitutes empty droplets, and applying emptyDrops instead.
 * Deployed barcode rank plots as a way of quickly assessing the signal present in droplet datasets.
 * Applied the necessary conversion to pass these data to downstream processes.
 * Retrieved partially analysed data from the Single Cell Expression Atlas
