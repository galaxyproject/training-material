title: Integrate and query local datasets and distant RDF data with AskOmics using Semantic Web technologies
questions:
- What is the Semantic Web and  how can it help to integrate and query data?
- How can AskOmics help to benefit from Semantic Web technologies without having the pain to write RDF or SPARQL code?
objectives:
- Understand the basics of RDF and SPARQL
- Learn how input data must be structured to be integrated with AskOmics
- Learn how to connect distant SPARQL endpoints to local data with AskOmics
key_points:
- RDF and SPARQL are Semantic Web technologies that come useful for data integration and querying but the technical aspects may deter end-users
- AskOmics is a web platform for data integration and query using Semantic Web in a user-friendly way

# How to explore data

---
## Requirements

Study of biological mechanisms requires to:

- **integrate** multiple data sources (differential expression results, genome annotation, remote protein database)
- **query** them to answer a biological question (which genes are over-expressed in a condition, and what are the protein coded by these genes)

# What is the Semantic Web?

---

## Semantic Web

Set of recommendations to **integrate data**, to **integrate domain knowledge** and to **perform query** and reasoning.

- Resource Description Framework (RDF): annotate data
- RDFS + OWL: represent knowledge (data description)
- SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL): query data

---

## RDF

- RDF is for describing **resources** (the R in RDF)
  - resources are identified by URIs (`nextprot:P01137`, `taxon:9606`)

- **describing** (D in RDF) a resource is representing it explicitly
  - its attributes (`nextprot:P01137 :hasSequence "MPPSGLRLLL..."`)
  - its relations to other entities (`nextprot:P01137 :hasTaxon taxon:9606`)
  - its descriptions (aka classes) (`nextprot:P01137 :is nextprot:Protein`)

---

## RDF: Set of triples

- RDF is represented by triples (subject, predicate, object)
  - **Subject**: the resource being described
  - **Predicate**: the relation (from subject to object)
  - **Object**: a value of the predicate for the subject

.image-01[ ![](images/rdf_schema_1.png)]

```turtle
nextprot:P01137 :hasTaxon taxon:9606 .
nextprot:P01137 :hasSequence "MPPSGLRLLL" .
```

---

## RDF: triples form a labeled directed graph


```turtle
# Description
nextprot:P01137 rdf:type nextprot:Protein .
taxon:9606 rdf:type nextprot:Organism .
# Data
nextprot:P01137 :hasTaxon taxon:9606 .
nextprot:P01137 :hasSequence "MPPSGLRLLL" .
```

.image-02[ ![](images/rdf_schema_2.png)]

---

## SPARQL

- The SPARQL language is a set of triple patterns with variables (`?variable_name`)

```
SELECT ?gene
WHERE {
    ?gene rdf:type :Gene .
    ?gene :hasTaxon taxon:9606 .
}
```

- All `?gene` with `rdf:type` `:Gene` **and** all `?gene` with `:hasTaxon` `taxon:9606`
- In other words, the query returns all the human genes


---

## SPARQL: entity matching allow federated queries

.pull-left[
- Using the same identifier for the same entity (**entity matching**) across multiple datasets allows federated queries

- Federated SPARQL queries provide unified querying capabilities over multiple datasets as if they were a single virtual graph

]

# What is AskOmics?

---

## AskOmics

Web software for **data integration** and **query** using Semantic Web. The main functionalities are:

- Convert of **multiple data format** into RDF triples and store them in a local triplestore
- Generate **complex SPARQL queries** using a user-friendly interface
- Support external SPARQL endpoint to **cross-reference integrated data with remote data**

AskOmics can be used as a standalone software, or **with Galaxy**

---


# Data integration with AskOmics

---

## Local data integration

- RDF and SPARQL are good infrastructures to describe and query biological datasets, but most of them are still stored on flat files like CSV/TSV and GFF.

- AskOmics converts multiple structured data formats into RDF triples
  * CSV/TSV
  * GFF
  * BED


---

## AskOmics generates the graph of data and the abstraction

AskOmics uses the file structure (*e.g.* header of TSV files) to generate the graph of data description: **the abstraction**

.image-04[ ![](images/askomics_convertion.png)]


The rest of the files is converted to RDF triples that correspond to the data.

---


## Distant RDF data integration

- Some public databases (*e.g.* [neXtProt](https://sparql.nextprot.org)) provide RDF data through a SPARQL endpoint (public access for RDF data)


- To connect with a remote SPARQL endpoint, AskOmics needs its RDF abstraction
- The abstraction can be generated with [abstractor](https://github.com/askomics/abstractor)

```bash
pip3 install abstractor
abstractor -s https://sparql.nextprot.org/sparql -o nextprot_abstraction.ttl -f turtle
```

- This abstraction can then be uploaded into AskOmics as a standard file


---

# Query multiple data sources with AskOmics

---

## Query composition

- Users navigate through the abstraction of local and remote data and create a path that represents a query

.image-06[ ![](images/askomics_query_builder.png)]

- The query is converted to SPARQL code that is executed on the local and remote RDF data
- Results are returned and can be downloaded
