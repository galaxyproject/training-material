### What is trajectory analysis?
.footnote[[Deconinck et al. Recent advances in trajectory inference from single-cell omics data](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coisb.2021.05.005.)]
--

Trajectory inference (TI) methods have emerged as a novel subfield within computational biology to better study the underlying dynamics of a biological process of interest, such as:

cellular development    | differentiation      | immune responses
:---:| :---:| :---:
.image-40[ ![development](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/1_cell_delevopment.png) ] | .image-40[ ![differentiation](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/2_differentiation.png) ] | .image-40[ ![immune](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/3_immune.png) ]

--
TI allows studying how cells evolve from one cell state to another, and subsequently when and how cell fate decisions are made.

### Clustering, trajectory and pseudotime

.pull-left[
**Clustering** calculates cell similarities to identify group cell types, that can be identified based on the marker genes expressed in each cluster.

**Trajectory inference** helps to understand how those cell types are related - whether cells differentiate, change in response to stimuli or over time. To infer trajectories, we need data from cells at different points along a path of differentiation. This inferred temporal dimension is known as pseudotime.   
**Pseudotime** measures the cells’ progress through the transition.

### Trajectory inference approaches: **Clustering-based (tree based)**

.footnote[[Deconinck et al. Recent advances in trajectory inference from single-cell omics data](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coisb.2021.05.005.)]
--

- Tries to find stable cell states in the data, then connect these states to form a trajectory and map the cells to the formed graph structure 

--

- Clustering approaches: soft K-means, Louvain, non-negative matrix factorization, hierarchical clustering

--

- To connect the clusters to each other, usually a **minimum weight spanning tree (MST)** is constructed (connecting without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight)

--

.image-25[ ![mst](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/mst.png) ]
---
### Trajectory inference approaches: **Graph-based**
.footnote[[Deconinck et al. Recent advances in trajectory inference from single-cell omics data](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coisb.2021.05.005.)]
--

- Constructs a graph representation of the cells and either uses graph decomposition to reveal connected and disconnected components, or graph diffusion or traversal methods to construct the trajectory topology

--

- Most methods start by building a **k-nearest neighbors (kNN) ** graph using the Euclidean distance

.image-50[ ![knn](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/knn.png) ]
--

- Diffusion peudotime (DPT) calculates the probability of cells transitioning into each other using random walks from a user-provided root cell and uses the differences between these probabilities as pseudotime


---

### Trajectory inference approaches: **Manifold learning-based**
.footnote[[Deconinck et al. Recent advances in trajectory inference from single-cell omics data](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coisb.2021.05.005.)]
--

- Assumes that data lays on a low-dimentional manifold embedded in a higher-dimentional space

--

- Uses principal curves and graphs to obtain smooth trajectories

--

- Usually used dimentionality reduction methods: **t-SNE** (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding), **UMAP** (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection), **PCA** (Principal component analysis), **ICA** (Independent Component Analysis), **LSA** (Latent semantic analysis)

### Extensions of trajectory inference: **RNA velocity methods**
.footnote[[Deconinck et al. Recent advances in trajectory inference from single-cell omics data](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coisb.2021.05.005.)]
--

- RNA velocity methods estimate the future state of a single cell captured in a static snapshot by looking at the ratios between spliced mRNA, unspliced mRNA, and mRNA degradation. 

--

- scVelo and CellRank use this extra velocity information to construct a directed k-nearest neighbor graph, as a starting step for the TI method. 

--

- This has the advantage that root cell specification is not necessary, and adds directional information to the trajectory.

--

.image-25[ ![velocity](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/velocity.png) ]

---
### Assumptions
--

- It would be quite difficult to analyse a sample every few seconds to see how the cells are changing. Therefore, we assume that snapshot data encompass all naïve, intermediate, and mature cell states with sufficient sampling coverage to allow the reconstruction of differentiation trajectories.    
[Sagar and Grün, 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115822/)

--

- As different TI methods make different assumptions about the data, a first choice to make is based on which biological process is to be expected: **not all TI methods are designed to infer all kinds of biological processes.**  
[Deconinck et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coisb.2021.05.005)

---
### Why different TI methods are designed to infer different kinds of biological processes?
--

Look at the pipeline presented by [Robrecht Cannoodt et al., 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eji.201646347)

--

.image-100[ ![pipeline](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/7_methods.jpg) ]        
--

There are multiple methods using particular algorithms, or even their combinations, so you must consider which one would be best for analysing your sample.

---

### When analysing your data, consider the following: 
--

.pull-left[  
  

- Tissue from which the cells come from   

- Branching points  

- Supervised and unsupervised learning  

- Format of the data  

- Number of cells and features  

- Computing power & running time

### When analysing your data, consider the following: **Tissue from which the cells come from**
--

.pull-left[
    
  
  
- Gives an idea about the topology you expect and the priors you can feed the method with, as well as expected cell types and potential contaminants  

- You need to know about 75% of your data and verify that your analysis shows that, before you can then identify the 25% new information  

- Trajectory analysis is quite a sensitive method, so always check if the obtained computational results make biological sense!

### When analysing your data, consider the following: **Branching points**

--

Cells can differentiate or develop in various way, so they may exhibit different topologies.

### When analysing your data, consider the following: **Branching points**  
  
  
  
.pull-left[
<br />
<br />
- diffusion pseudotime (DPT) and branch points
 - DPT does not rely on dimension reduction and can thus detect subtle changes in high-dimensional gene expression patterns
 - DPT-based analysis proceeds by identifying branching points that occur after cells progress from a root cell through a common ‘trunk trajectory’   
 <sub>[L. Haghverdi et al. (2016)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3971)</sub>

- binning and DNB (Dynamical Network Biomarker) theory
 - order cells, according to the pseudotime, evenly segmented into nonoverlap bins with each bin containing X cells
 - categorize DNB and non-DNB markers for each bin
 - one bin contains some unassigned cells - annotated as branch bin; of the remaining bins, there are bins on the trunk, and bins for each of the branch1 and branch2

- Some algorithms work fully unsupervised, ie. the user is not required to input any priors.  

- However, many of them take the ‘starting cell’, or ‘end cell’ as information that helps to infer the trajectory which best represents the actual biological processes.  

- On the other hand, priors can bias the outcome of the method, but if chosen appropriately, they are really helpful.

---
### When analysing your data, consider the following: **Supervised and unsupervised learning**

If you know which cells are root cells, you should enter this information to the method to make the computations more precise. However, some methods use unsupervised algorithms, so you will get a trajectory based on the tools they use and topology they can infer.

---
### When analysing your data, consider the following: **Format of the data**
--

- You have to check that your chosen method is compatible with the format of your data. If not, consider converting it or even contacting the developers to implement this into the pipeline.  

--

- Other possible inputs: 
 - Raw (FASTQ); 
 - Cellxgene matrix; 
 - Matrix, genes & barcodes tables; 
 - AnnData  
 - RDS

- Implementations  

.image-100[ ![implementation](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/implementation_1.jpg) ]

---
### When analysing your data, consider the following: **Number of cells and features**
--

- The more cells and features you have, the more dimensions there are in your dataset. Therefore, it may be more computationally difficult for the particular method to reduce the dimensionality and infer the correct trajectory.   

--

- For example, PAGA generally performs better than RaceID or Monocle when the dataset contains huge number of cells. (PAGA is graph-based, Monocle is tree based).  

--

- Also, the more cells you have, the more insightful data you can get, but it is often associated with more noise as well. Therefore, the number of cells also impacts how you pre-process your data and how ‘pure’ it will be for trajectory analysis. 

---
### When analysing your data, consider the following: **Computing power & running time**

It doesn't directly affect your analysis, however do bear in mind that calculations performed during dimensionality reduction, especially on large datasets, can be really time-consuming. Therefore, you might consider if you won't be limited by any of those factors.

### Trajectory analysis methods used in Galaxy: **PAGA (Partition-based graph abstraction)**
.footnote[[F.A. Wolf et al. 'PAGA: graph abstraction reconciles clustering with trajectory inference through a topology preserving map of single cells' (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1663-x)]

--

-  Provides an interpretable graph-like map of the arising data manifold, based on estimating connectivity of manifold partitions. The graph nodes correspond to cell groups and whose edge weights quantify the connectivity between groups  

--

- By following high-confidence paths in the abstracted graph and ordering cells within each group in the path according to their distance from a progenitor cell, we trace gene changes at single-cell resolution. Hence, PAGA covers both aspects of clustering and pseudotemporal ordering by providing a coordinate system that allows us to explore variation in data while preserving its topology

--

- Provides a natural way of abstracting both topological information and information about RNA velocity  

--

- Available within [Scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/scanpy.tl.paga.html)
