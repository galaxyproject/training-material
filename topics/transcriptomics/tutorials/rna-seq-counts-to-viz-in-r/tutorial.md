# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

{% include topics/introduction/tutorials/r-basics/tutorial_origin.md %}

With RNA-Seq data analysis, we generated tables containing list of DE genes, their expression, some statistics, etc. We can manipulate these tables using Galaxy, as we saw in some tutorials, e.g. ["Reference-based RNA-Seq data analysis"]({% link topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/ref-based/tutorial.md %}), and create some visualisations.

Sometimes we want to have some customizations on visualization, some complex table manipulations or some statistical analysis. If we can not find a Galaxy tools for that or the right parameters, we may need to use programming languages as R or Python.

In this tutorial, we will take the list of DE genes extracted from DESEq2's output that we generated in the ["Reference-based RNA-Seq data analysis" tutorial]({% link topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/ref-based/tutorial.md %}), manipulate it and create some visualizations.

# Visualization

In RNA-seq data analysis and other omics experiments, visualization are an important step to check the data, their quality and represent the results found for publication.

`ggplot2` is a plotting package that makes it simple to create complex plots from data in a data frame. It provides a more programmatic interface for specifying what variables to plot, how they are displayed, and general visual properties. Therefore, we only need minimal changes if the underlying data change or if we decide to change from a bar plot to a scatter plot. This helps in creating publication quality plots with minimal amounts of adjustments and tweaking.

`ggplot2` graphics are built step by step by adding new elements, i.e. layers:

```R
ggplot(data = <DATA>, mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>() +
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>() +
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>()
```

Adding layers in this fashion allows for extensive flexibility and customization of plots.

We should obtain our first ggplot2 plot:

![Our first ggplot2 plot](../../images/rna-seq-counts-to-viz-in-r/firstPlot.png)

This plot is called a volcano plot, a type of scatterplot that shows statistical significance (P value) versus magnitude of change (fold change). The most upregulated genes are towards the right, the most downregulated genes are towards the left, and the most statistically significant genes are towards the top. With this plot, we can then quickly identify genes with large fold changes that are also statistically significant, i.e. probably the most biologically significant genes.

The current version of the plot is not really informative, mostly due to the high number of p-values close to zero. In order to resolve this, we will apply `-log10()` to the y-axis values.

> The `+` sign used to add new layers must be placed at the end of the line containing the previous layer. If, instead, the `+` sign is added at the beginning of the line containing the new layer, `ggplot2` will not add the new layer and will return an error message.

Building plots with `ggplot2` is typically an iterative process. We start by defining the dataset we'll use, lay out the axes, and choose a `geom`. We can now modify this plot to extract more information from it.

## Volcano plot by chromosomes

`ggplot2` has a special technique called faceting that allows us to split one plot into multiple plots based on a factor included in the dataset. We will use it to split our volcano plot into five panels, one for each chromosome.

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

Data manipulation and visualization are important parts of any RNA-Seq analysis. Galaxy provides several tools for that as explained in several tutorials:

- [Reference-based RNA-Seq]({% link topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/ref-based/tutorial.md %})
- [Visualization of RNA-seq results with heatmap2]({% link topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/rna-seq-viz-with-heatmap2/tutorial.md %})
- [Visualization of RNA-seq results with Volcano Plot]({% link topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/rna-seq-viz-with-volcanoplot/tutorial.md %})

But sometimes we need more customization and then need to use programming languages as R or Python.

Working with a programming language (especially if it's your first time) often feels intimidating, but the rewards outweigh any frustrations. An important secret of coding is that even experienced programmers find it difficult and frustrating at times – so if even the best feel that way, why let intimidation stop you? Given time and practice you will soon find it easier and easier to accomplish what you want.

Finally, we won't lie; R is not the easiest-to-learn programming language ever created. So, don't get discouraged! The truth is that even with the modest amount of R covered today, you can start using some sophisticated R software packages, and have a general sense of how to interpret an R script. Get through these lessons, and you are on your way to being an accomplished R user!
