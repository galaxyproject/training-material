# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

In recent years, RNA sequencing (in short RNA-Seq) has become a very widely used technology to analyze the continuously changing cellular transcriptome, i.e. the set of all RNA molecules in one cell or a population of cells. One of the most common aims of RNA-Seq is the profiling of gene expression by identifying genes or molecular pathways that are differentially expressed (DE) between two or more biological conditions. This tutorial demonstrates a computational workflow for the detection of DE genes and pathways from RNA-Seq data by providing a complete analysis of an RNA-Seq experiment profiling *Drosophila* cells after the depletion of a regulatory gene.

In the study of {% cite brooks2011conservation %}, the authors identified genes and pathways regulated by the *Pasilla* gene (the *Drosophila* homologue of the mammalian splicing regulators Nova-1 and Nova-2 proteins) using RNA-Seq data. They depleted the *Pasilla* (*PS*) gene in *Drosophila melanogaster* by RNA interference (RNAi). Total RNA was then isolated and used to prepare both single-end and paired-end RNA-Seq libraries for treated (PS depleted) and untreated samples. These libraries were sequenced to obtain RNA-Seq reads for each sample. The RNA-Seq data for the treated and the untreated samples can be compared to identify the effects of *Pasilla* gene depletion on gene expression.

In this tutorial, we illustrate the analysis of the gene expression data step by step using 7 of the original datasets:

- 4 untreated samples: [GSM461176](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461176), [GSM461177](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461177), [GSM461178](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461178), [GSM461182](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461182)
- 3 treated samples (*Pasilla* gene depleted by RNAi): [GSM461179](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461179), [GSM461180](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461180), [GSM461181](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461181)

Each sample constitutes a separate biological replicate of the corresponding condition (treated or untreated). Moreover, two of the treated and two of the untreated samples are from a paired-end sequencing assay, while the remaining samples are from a single-end sequencing experiment.

# Data upload

In the first part of this tutorial we will use the files for 2 out of the 7 samples to demonstrate how to calculate read counts (a measure of the gene expression) from FASTQ files (quality control, mapping, read counting). We provide the FASTQ files for the other 5 samples if you want to reproduce the whole analysis later.

In the second part of the tutorial, read counts of all 7 samples are used to identify and visualize the DE genes, gene families and molecular pathways due to the depletion of the *PS* gene.

The reads are raw data from the sequencing machine without any pretreatments. They need to be assessed for their quality.

# Quality control

During sequencing, errors are introduced, such as incorrect nucleotides being called. These are due to the technical limitations of each sequencing platform. Sequencing errors might bias the analysis and can lead to a misinterpretation of the data.

Sequence quality control is therefore an essential first step in your analysis. We will use similar tools as described in the ["Quality control" training]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.md %}): [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and [Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html) ({% cite marcel2011cutadapt %}).

We should trim sequenced read to get rid of bases that were sequenced with high uncertainty (= low quality bases) at the read ends but also remove the reads of overall bad quality.

# Mapping

To make sense of the reads, we need to first figure out where the sequenced DNA fragments originated from in the genome, so we can then determine to which genes they belong.

This process is known as aligning or 'mapping' the reads to a reference. This is equivalent to solving a jigsaw puzzle, but unfortunately, not all pieces are unique.

{: .comment}

As a reference genome for *Drosophila melanogaster* is available, we can map the sequences to this genome in order to identify which genes are affected by the *Pasilla* gene depletion.

{% include topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/mapping/ref_genome_explanation.md answer_3="The genome of *Drosophila melanogaster* is known and assembled and it can be used as the reference genome in this analysis. Note that new versions of reference genomes may be released if the assembly improves, for this tutorial we are going to use the release 6 of the *Drosophila melanogaster* reference genome assembly [(dm6)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4383921/)."%}

With eukaryotic transcriptomes most reads originate from processed mRNAs lacking introns, therefore they cannot be simply mapped back to the genome as we normally do for DNA data. Instead the reads must be separated into two categories:

- Reads that can be mapped entirely within an exon
- Reads spanning two or more exons

![Five types of RNA-Seq reads](../../images/five_type_rna_seq_reads.png "The five types of RNA-seq reads (Figure 1a from {% cite kim2015hisat %})")

Spliced mappers have been developed to efficiently map transcript-derived reads against genomes:

![Splice-aware alignment](../../images/splice_aware_alignment.png "Principle of spliced mappers: (1) identification of the reads spanning a single exon, (2) identification of the splicing junctions on the unmapped reads")

> [**TopHat**](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml) ({% cite trapnell2009tophat %}) was one of the first tools designed specifically to address this problem. In **TopHat** reads are mapped against the genome and are separated into two categories: (1) those that map, and (2) those that are initially unmapped (IUM). "Piles" of reads representing potential exons are extended in search of potential donor/acceptor splice sites and potential splice junctions are reconstructed. IUMs are then mapped to these junctions.

> To further optimize and speed up spliced read alignment, [**HISAT2**](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml) ({% cite kim2019graph %}) was developed. It uses a hierarchical graph [FM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-index) (HGFM) index, representing the entire genome and eventual variants, together with overlapping local indexes (each spanning ~57 kb) that collectively cover the genome and its variants. This allows to find initial seed locations for potential read alignments in the genome using global index and to rapidly refine these alignments using a corresponding local index:
>
>    ![Hierarchical Graph FM index in HISAT/HISAT2](../../images/hisat.png "Hierarchical Graph FM index in HISAT/HISAT2 (Figure S8 from {% cite kim2015hisat %})")
>
> A part of the read (blue arrow) is first mapped to the genome using the global FM index. **HISAT2** then tries to extend the alignment directly utilizing the genome sequence (violet arrow). In (**a**) it succeeds and this read is aligned as it completely resides within an exon. In (**b**) the extension hits a mismatch. Now **HISAT2** takes advantage of the local FM index overlapping this location to find the appropriate mapping for the remainder of this read (green arrow). The (**c**) shows a combination these two strategies: the beginning of the read is mapped using global FM index (blue arrow), extended until it reaches the end of the exon (violet arrow), mapped using local FM index (green arrow) and extended again (violet arrow).

> [**STAR** aligner](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) ({% cite dobin2013star %}) is a fast alternative for mapping RNA-Seq reads against a reference genome utilizing an uncompressed [suffix array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_array). It operates in two stages. In the first stage it performs a seed search:
>
>    ![STAR's seed search](../../images/star.png "STAR's seed search (Figure 1 from {% cite dobin2013star %})")
>
> Here a read is split between two consecutive exons. **STAR** starts to look for a maximum mappable prefix (MMP) from the beginning of the read until it can no longer match continuously. After this point it start to look for a MMP for the unmatched portion of the read (**a**). In the case of mismatches (**b**) and unalignable regions (**c**) MMPs serve as anchors from which to extend alignments.
>
> At the second stage **STAR** stitches MMPs to generate read-level alignments that (contrary to MMPs) can contain mismatches and indels. A scoring scheme is used to evaluate and prioritize stitching combinations and to evaluate reads that map to multiple locations. **STAR** is extremely fast but requires a substantial amount of RAM to run efficiently.

**STAR** generates a BAM file with the mapped reads.

{% include topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/mapping/bam_explanation.md mapper="RNA STAR" %}

## Inspection of the mapping results

The BAM file contains information about where the reads are mapped on the reference genome. But as it is a binary file containing information for many reads (several million for these samples), it is difficult to inspect and explore the file.

A powerful tool to visualize the content of BAM files is the Integrative Genomics Viewer (**IGV**, {% cite robinson2011integrative %}).

> The gene body is the different regions of a gene. It is important to check if reads coverage is uniform over gene body or if there is any 5'/3' bias. For example, a bias towards the 5' end of genes could indicate degradation of the RNA. Alternatively, a 3' bias could indicate that the data is from a 3' assay. To assess this, we can use the **Gene Body Coverage** tool from the RSeQC ({% cite wang2012rseqc %}) tool suite. This tool scales all transcripts to 100 nucleotides (using a provided annotation file) and calculates the number of reads covering each nucleotide position.

Before going further in counting and differential expression analysis, it may be interesting to check the distribution of reads across known gene features (exons, CDS, 5' UTR, 3' UTR, introns, intergenic regions). For example, a high number of reads mapping to intergenic regions may indicate the presence of DNA contamination.

After the mapping, we have the information on where the reads are located on the reference genome. We also know how well they were mapped. The next step in RNA-Seq data analysis is quantification of the number of reads mapped to genomic features (genes, transcripts, exons, ...).

> ### {% icon comment %} Comment
>
> The quantification depends on both the reference genome (the FASTA file) and its associated annotations (the GTF file). It is extremely important to use an annotation file that corresponds to the same version of the reference genome you used for the mapping (e.g. `dm6` here), as the chromosomal coordinates of genes are usually different amongst different reference genome versions.

In order to identify genes that are regulated by the *Pasilla* gene, we need to identify genes which are differentially expressed between samples with PS gene depletion (treated) and control (untreated) samples.

# Counting the number of reads per annotated gene

To compare the expression of single genes between different conditions (*e.g.* with or without PS depletion), an essential first step is to quantify the number of reads per gene.

Two main tools could be used for that: [**HTSeq-count**](http://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.9.1/count.html) ({% cite anders2015htseq %}) or **featureCounts** ({% cite liao2013featurecounts %}). FeatureCounts is considerably faster and requires far less computational resources, so we will use it here.

In principle, the counting of reads overlapping with genomic features is a fairly simple task. But there are some details that need to be given to **featureCounts**: for example the strandness.

## Estimation of the strandness

RNAs that are typically targeted in RNA-Seq experiments are single stranded (*e.g.*, mRNAs) and thus have polarity (5' and 3' ends that are functionally distinct). During a typical RNA-Seq experiment the information about strandness is lost after both strands of cDNA are synthesized, size selected, and converted into a sequencing library. However, this information can be quite useful for the read counting step:

![Why strandness?](../../images/ref-based/strandness_why.png "Read1 will be assigned to gene1 located on the forward strand but Read2 could be assigned to gene1 (forward strand) or gene2 (reverse strand) depending if the strandness information is conserved.")

Some library preparation protocols create so called *stranded* RNA-Seq libraries that preserve the strand information (an excellent overview in {% cite levin2010comprehensive %}). In practice, with Illumina paired-end RNA-Seq protocols you are unlikely to encounter many of these possibilities. You will most likely deal with either:

- Unstranded RNA-Seq data
- Stranded RNA-Seq data generated by the use of specialized RNA isolation kits during sample preparation

> ### {% icon details %} More details about strandness
>
> ![Relationship between DNA and RNA orientation](../../images/dna_rna.png "Relationship between DNA and RNA orientation")

> The implication of stranded RNA-Seq is that you can distinguish whether the reads are derived from forward or reverse-encoded transcripts:

> Depending on the approach, and whether one performs single-end or paired-end sequencing, there are multiple possibilities on how to interpret the results of the mapping of these reads to the genome:

{: .details}

This information should be provided with your FASTQ files, ask your sequencing facility! If not, try to find it on the site where you downloaded the data or in the corresponding publication.

Another option is to estimate these parameters with a tool called **Infer Experiment** from the RSeQC ({% cite wang2012rseqc %}) tool suite. This tool takes the output of your mappings (BAM files), selects a subsample of your reads and compares their genome coordinates and strands with those of the reference gene model (from an annotation file). Based on the strand of the genes, it can gauge whether sequencing is strand-specific, and if so, how reads are stranded (forward or reverse):

![How to estimate the strandness?](../../images/ref-based/strandness_cases.png "In a stranded forward library, reads map mostly on the genes located on forward strand (here gene1). With stranded reverse library, reads map mostly on genes on the reverse strand (here gene2). With unstranded library, reads maps on genes on both strands.")

**Infer Experiment** {% icon tool %} tool generates one file with information on:
- Paired-end or single-end library
- Fraction of reads failed to determine
- 2 lines
    - For single-end
        - `Fraction of reads explained by "++,--"`: the fraction of reads that assigned to forward strand
        - `Fraction of reads explained by "+-,-+"`: the fraction of reads that assigned to reverse strand
    - For paired-end
        - `Fraction of reads explained by "1++,1--,2+-,2-+"`: the fraction of reads that assigned to forward strand
        - `Fraction of reads explained by "1+-,1-+,2++,2--"`: the fraction of reads that assigned to reverse strand

If the two "Fraction of reads explained by" numbers are close to each other, we conclude that the library is not a strand-specific dataset (or unstranded).

**FeatureCount** generates also the **feature length** output datasets. We will need this file later on when we will run the **goseq** tool.

Here we counted reads mapped to genes for two samples. It is really interesting to redo the same procedure on the other datasets, especially to check how parameters differ given the different type of data (single-end versus paired-end).

## Identification of the differentially expressed features

To be able to identify differential gene expression induced by PS depletion, all datasets (3 treated and 4 untreated) must be analyzed following the same procedure. To save time, we have run the previous steps for you. We then obtain 7 files with the counts for each gene of *Drosophila* for each sample.

We could compare the files directly and calculate the extent of differential gene expression. But it is not so simple.

Let's imagine we have RNA-Seq counts from 3 samples for a genome with 4 genes:

Gene | Sample 1 Counts | Sample 2 Counts | Sample 3 Counts
--- | --- | --- | ---
A (2kb) | 10 | 12 | 30
B (4kb) | 20 | 25 | 60
C (1kb) | 5 | 8 | 15
D (10kb) | 0 | 0 | 1

Sample 3 has more reads than the other replicates, regardless of the gene. It has a higher sequencing depth than the other replicates. Gene B is twice as long as gene A: it might explain why it has twice as many reads, regardless of replicates

The number of sequenced reads mapped to a gene depends then on:

- The **sequencing depth** of the samples

    Samples sequenced with more depth will have more reads mapping to each genes

- The **length of the gene**

    Longer genes will have more reads mapping to them

To compare samples or gene expressions, the gene counts need to be normalized. We could use TPM (Transcripts Per Kilobase Million).

> **FPKM** (Fragments Per Kilobase Million) is very similar to RPKM. RPKM is for single-end RNA-seq and FPKM for paired-end RNA-seq. With single-end, every read corresponds to a single fragment that was sequenced. With paired-end RNA-seq, two reads of a pair are mapped from a single fragment, or if one read in the pair did not map, one read can correspond to a single fragment (in case we decided to keep these). FPKM keeps tracks of fragments so that one fragment with 2 reads is counted only once.

Indeed, the sum of the TPMs in both samples adds up to the same number (10 here), the denominator required to calculate the proportions is then the same regardless of the sample, and so the proportion of reads for gene A (3.33/10 = 0.33) for both sample.

RNA-Seq is often used to compare one tissue type to another. For example, muscle vs epithelial tissue. And it could be that there are a lot of muscle specific genes transcribed in muscle but not in the epithelial tissue. We call that a **difference in library composition**.

It is also possible to see a difference in library composition in the same tissue type after the knock out of a transcription factor.

Let's imagine we have RNA-Seq counts from 2 samples (same library size: 635 reads), for a genome with 6 genes. The genes have the same expression in both sample, except one: only Sample 1 transcribe gene D, at a high level (563 reads). This means that the 563 reads used by D in Sample 1 will be distributed to other genes in Sample 2.

Gene | Sample 1 | Sample 2
--- | --- | --- | ---
A | 30 | 235
B | 24 | 188
C | 0 | 0
D | 563 | 0
E | 5 | 39
F | 13 | 102
**Total** | 635 | 635

The read count for all genes except for gene C and D is really high in Sample 2. But the only differentially expressed gene is gene D.

TPM, RPKM or FPKM do not deal with these differences in library composition in normalization, but more complex tools, like DESeq2, do.

[**DESeq2**](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) ({% cite love2014moderated %}) is a great tool for dealing with RNA-seq data and running Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis. It takes read count files from different samples, combines them into a big table (with genes in the rows and samples in the columns) and applies normalization for **sequencing depth** and **library composition**. Gene length normalization does not need to be accounted for because we are comparing the counts between sample groups for the same gene.

DESeq2 runs also the Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis, whose two basic tasks are:

- Estimate the biological variance using the replicates for each condition
- Estimate the significance of expression differences between any two conditions

This expression analysis is estimated from read counts and attempts are made to correct for variability in measurements using replicates, that are absolutely essential for accurate results. For your own analysis, we advise you to use at least 3, but preferably 5 biological replicates per condition. It is possible to have different numbers of replicates per condition.

> ### {% icon details %} Technical vs biological replicates
>
> A technical replicate is an experiment which is performed once but measured several times (e.g. multiple sequencing of the same library). A biological replicate is an experiment performed (and also measured) several times.
>
> In our data, we have 4 biological replicates (here called samples) without treatment and 3 biological replicates with treatment (*Pasilla* gene depleted by RNAi).
>
> We recommend to combine the count tables for different technical replicates (but not for biological replicates) before a differential expression analysis (see [DESeq2 documentation](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#collapsing-technical-replicates))
{: .details}

Multiple factors with several levels can then be incorporated in the analysis. After normalization we can compare the response of the expression of any gene to the presence of different levels of a factor in a statistically reliable way.

In our example, we have samples with two varying factors that can contribute to differences in gene expression:

- Treatment (either treated or untreated)
- Sequencing type (paired-end or single-end)

Here, treatment is the primary factor that we are interested in. The sequencing type is further information we know about the data that might affect the analysis. Multi-factor analysis allows us to assess the effect of the treatment, while taking the sequencing type into account too.

**DESeq2** generated 3 outputs

- A table with the normalized counts for each gene (rows) in the samples (columns)
- A graphical summary of the results, useful to evaluate the quality of the experiment:

    1. Plot with the first 2 dimensions from a principal component analysis ([PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)) run on the normalized counts of the samples

        > ### {% icon details %} What is a PCA?
        >
        > Let's imagine we have some beer bottles standing here on the table. We can describe each beer by its colour,its foam, by how strong it is, and so on. We can compose a whole list of different characteristics of each beer in a beer shop. But many of them will measure related properties and so will be redundant. If so, we should be able to summarize each beer with fewer characteristics. This is what PCA or principal component analysis does.
        >
        > With PCA, we do not just select some interesting characteristics and discard the others. Instead, we construct some new characteristics that summarize our list of beers well. These new characteristics are constructed using the old ones. For example, a new characteristic might be computed, e.g. foam size minus beer pH. They are linear combinations.
        >
        > In fact, PCA finds the best possible characteristics, the ones that summarize the list of beers. These characteristics can be used to find similarities between beers and group them.
        >
        > Going back to read counts, the PCA is run on the normalized counts for all the samples. Here, we would like to describe the samples based on the expression of the genes. So the characteristics are the number of reads mapped on each genes. We use them and linear combinations of them to represent the samples and their similarities.

        It shows the samples in the 2D plane spanned by their first two principal components. Each replicate is plotted as an individual data point. This type of plot is useful for visualizing the overall effect of experimental covariates and batch effects.

    3. Dispersion estimates: gene-wise estimates (black), the fitted values (red), and the final maximum a posteriori estimates used in testing (blue)

        This dispersion plot is typical, with the final estimates shrunk from the gene-wise estimates towards the fitted estimates. Some gene-wise estimates are flagged as outliers and not shrunk towards the fitted value. The amount of shrinkage can be more or less than seen here, depending on the sample size, the number of coefficients, the row mean and the variability of the gene-wise estimates.

    4. Histogram of *p*-values for the genes in the comparison between the 2 levels of the 1st factor

    5. [MA plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MA_plot)

        It displays the global view of the relationship between the expression change of conditions (log ratios, M), the average expression strength of the genes (average mean, A), and the ability of the algorithm to detect differential gene expression. The genes that passed the significance threshold (adjusted p-value < 0.1) are colored in red.

    1.  Gene identifiers
    2.  Mean normalized counts, averaged over all samples from both conditions
    3.  Fold change in log2 (logarithm base 2)

        The log2 fold changes are based on the primary factor level 1 vs factor level 2, hence the input order of factor levels is important. Here, DESeq2 computes fold changes of 'treated' samples against 'untreated' from the first factor 'Treatment', *i.e.* the values correspond to up- or downregulation of genes in treated samples.

We now have a table with 130 lines corresponding to the most differentially expressed genes. For each gene, we have its ID, its mean normalized counts (averaged over all samples from both conditions), its $$log_{2} FC$$ and other information.

The ID for each gene is something like FBgn0003360, which is an ID from the corresponding database, here Flybase. These IDs are unique but sometimes we prefer to have the gene names, even if they may not reference an unique gene (e.g. duplicated after re-annotation). But gene names may hint already to a function or they help you to search for desired candidates. We would also like to have the location of these genes within the genome. To do that, we need do add extra annotations from the annotation file which we used for mapping and counting.

## Visualization of the expression of the differentially expressed genes

We could plot the $$log_{2} FC$$ for the extracted genes, but here we would like to look at a heatmap of expression for these genes in the different samples. So we need to extract the normalized counts for these genes.

We proceed in several steps:
- Extract and plot the normalized counts for these genes for each sample with a heatmap, using the normalized count file generated by DESeq2
- Compute, extract and plot the Z-score of the normalized counts

### Visualization of the normalized counts

To extract the normalized counts for the interesting genes, we join the normalized count table generated by DESeq2 with the table we just generated. We will then keep only the lines corresponding to the most differentially expressed genes.

### Computation and visualization of the Z-score

To compare the gene expression over samples, we could also use the Z-score, which is often represented in publications.

The Z-score gives the number of standard-deviations that a value is away from the mean of all the values in the same group, here the same gene. A Z-score of -2 for the gene X in sample A means that this value is 2 standard-deviations lower than the mean of the values for gene X in all the samples (A, B, C, etc).

The Z-score $$z_{i,j}$$ for a gene $$i$$ in a sample $$j$$ given the normalized count $$x_{i,j}$$ is computed as $$z_{i,j} = \frac{x_{i,j}- \overline{x_i}}{s_i}$$ with $$\overline{x_i}$$ the mean and $$s_i$$ the standard deviation of the normalized counts for the gene $$i$$ over all samples.

> ### {% icon comment %} Compute the Z-score for all genes
>
> To save time in this tutorial, we will compute the Z-score directly on the normalized count of the most differentially expressed genes. In a standard analysis, we would compute the Z-score on all the genes (`Normalized count` file from **DESeq**) and then filter for the interesting genes as we did in the previous step.
{: .comment}

To compute the Z-score, we break the process into 2 steps:
1. Substract each value by the mean of values in the row (i.e. $$x_{i,j}- \overline{x_i}$$) using the normalized count table
2. Divide the previous values by the standard deviation of values of row, using 2 tables (the normalized counts and the table computed in the previous step)

Not tightly controlled genes, i.e. whose expression may vary in a wide range over samples, can be considerably induced or repressed. Their absolute Z-score will be small as the variations over samples is big. In contrast, genes that are tightly controlled may have only very small changes in their expression, without any biological impact. The absolute Z-score will be large for these genes.

# Functional enrichment analysis of the DE genes

We have extracted genes that are differentially expressed in treated (PS gene-depleted) samples compared to untreated samples. Now, we would like to know if the differentially expressed genes are enriched transcripts of genes which belong to more common or specific categories to classify their potential function a bit better. These categories are called Gene Ontologies (GO).

## Gene Ontology analysis

[Gene Ontology (GO)](http://www.geneontology.org/) analysis is widely used to reduce complexity and highlight biological processes in genome-wide expression studies. However, standard methods give biased results on RNA-Seq data due to over-detection of differential expression for long and highly-expressed transcripts.

The [**goseq**](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/goseq/inst/doc/goseq.pdf) tool ({% cite young2010gene %}) provides methods for performing GO analysis of RNA-Seq data, taking length bias into account. The methods and software used by goseq are equally applicable to other category based tests of RNA-Seq data, such as KEGG pathway analysis.

**goseq** needs 2 files as inputs:
- A tabular file with the differentially expressed genes from all genes assayed in the RNA-Seq experiment with 2 columns:
    - the Gene IDs (unique within the file), in uppercase letters
    - a boolean telling if the gene is differentially expressed or not: `True` if differentially expressed or `False` if not
- A file with information about the length of a gene to correct for potential length bias in differentially expressed genes

    1. `category`: GO category
    2. `over_rep_pval`: *p*-value for over-representation of the term in the differentially expressed genes
    3. `under_rep_pval`: *p*-value for under-representation of the term in the differentially expressed genes
    4. `numDEInCat`: number of differentially expressed genes in this category
    5. `numInCat`: number of genes in this category
    6. `term`: detail of the term

    9. `p.adjust.under_represented`: *p*-value for over-representation of the term in the differentially expressed genes, adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure

    To identify categories significantly enriched/unenriched below some p-value cutoff, it is necessary to use the adjusted *p*-value.

## KEGG pathways analysis

**goseq** can also be used to identify interesting KEGG pathways. The KEGG pathway database is a collection of pathway maps representing the current knowledge on the molecular interaction, reaction and relation networks. A map can integrate many entities including genes, proteins, RNAs, chemical compounds, glycans, and chemical reactions, as well as disease genes and drug targets.

For example, the pathway `dme00010` represents the Glycolysis process (conversion of glucose into pyruvate with generation of small amounts of ATP and NADH) for Drosophila melanogaster:

2. A table with the differentially expressed genes (from the list we provided) associated to the KEGG pathways (`DE genes for categories (GO/KEGG terms)`)

We could investigate which genes are involved in which pathways by looking at the second file generated by **goseq**. But it can be cumbersome and we would like to see the pathways as represented in the previous image. **Pathview** ({% cite luo2013pathview %}) can help to generate automatically similar images as the previous one but also add extra information about the genes (e.g. expression) in our study.

This tool needs 2 main information as inputs:
- Pathway ID(s) to plot, either as just one ID or as a file with one column with the pathway IDs
- A tabular file with the genes in the RNA-Seq experiment with 2 (or more) columns:
    - the gene IDs (unique within the file)
    - some information about the genes

      It can be for example a p-value or a fold change. This information will be added to the pathway plot: the node of the corresponding gene will be colored given the value. If there are different columns, the different information will be plotted side by side on the node.

Here we would like to visualize the 2 KEGG pathways: the over-represented `00010` (Glycolysis / Gluconeogenesis) and the under-represented `03040` (Spliceosome). We would like that the gene nodes are colored by Log2 Fold Change for the differentially expressed genes because of the treatment.

# Inference of the differential exon usage

Next, we would like to know the differential exon usage between treated (PS depleted) and untreated samples using RNA-Seq exon counts. We will rework the mapping results we generated previously.

We will use [DEXSeq](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEXSeq.html). DEXSeq detects high sensitivity genes, and in many cases exons, that are subject to differential exon usage. But first, as for the differential gene expression, we need to count the number of reads mapping to the exons.

## Count the number of reads per exon

This step is similar to the step of [counting the number of reads per annotated gene](#count-the-number-of-reads-per-annotated-gene) except that, instead of HTSeq-count, we are using DEXSeq-Count.

DEXSeq generates a count table similar to the one generated by featureCounts, but with counts for exons.

## Differential exon usage

DEXSeq usage is similar to DESeq2. It uses similar statistics to find differentially used exons.

As for DESeq2, in the previous step, we counted only reads that mapped to exons on chromosome 4 and for only one sample. To be able to identify differential exon usage induced by PS depletion, all datasets (3 treated and 4 untreated) must be analyzed following the same procedure. To save time, we did that for you. The results are available on [Zenodo]({{ page.zenodo_link }}):

- The results of running DEXSeq-count in 'Prepare annotation' mode
- Seven count files generated in 'Count reads' mode

Similarly to DESeq2, DEXSeq generates a table with:

1.  Exon identifiers
2.  Gene identifiers
3.  Exon identifiers in the Gene
4.  Mean normalized counts, averaged over all samples from both conditions
5.  Logarithm (to basis 2) of the fold change

    The log2 fold changes are based on primary factor level 1 vs. factor level 2. The order of factor levels is then important. For example, for the factor 'Condition', DESeq2 computes fold changes of 'treated' samples against 'untreated', *i.e.* the values correspond to up- or downregulations of genes in treated samples.

6.  Standard error estimate for the log2 fold change estimate
7.  *p*-value for the statistical significance of this change
8.  *p*-value adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure which controls false discovery rate ([FDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate))

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

In this tutorial, we have analyzed real RNA sequencing data to extract useful information, such as which genes are up or downregulated by depletion of the *Pasilla* gene, but also which GO terms or KEGG pathways they are involved in. To answer these questions, we analyzed RNA sequence datasets using a reference-based RNA-Seq data analysis approach. This approach can be summarized with the following scheme:
