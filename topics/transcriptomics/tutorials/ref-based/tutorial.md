# Introduction

In the study of [Brooks *et al.* 2011](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/21/2/193.long), the Pasilla (PS) gene, *Drosophila* homologue of the Human splicing regulators Nova-1 and Nova-2 Proteins, was depleted in *Drosophila melanogaster* by RNAi. The authors wanted to identify exons that are regulated by Pasilla gene using RNA sequencing data.

Total RNA was isolated and used for preparing either single-end or paired-end RNA-seq libraries for treated (PS depleted) samples and untreated samples. These libraries were sequenced to obtain a collection of RNA sequencing reads for each sample. The effects of Pasilla gene depletion on splicing events can then be analyzed by comparison of RNA sequencing data of the treated (PS depleted) and the untreated samples.

The genome of *Drosophila melanogaster* is known and assembled. It can be used as reference genome to ease this analysis.  In a reference based RNA-seq data analysis, the reads are aligned (or mapped) against a reference genome, *Drosophila melanogaster* here, to significantly improve the ability to reconstruct transcripts and then identify differences of expression between several conditions.

# Pretreatments

## Data upload

The original data is available at NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number [GSE18508](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE18508).

We will look at the 7 first samples:

- 3 treated samples with Pasilla (PS) gene depletion: [GSM461179](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461179), [GSM461180](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461180), [GSM461181](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM4611810)
- 4 untreated samples: [GSM461176](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461176), [GSM461177](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461177), [GSM461178](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461178), [GSM461182](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461182)

Each sample constitutes a separate biological replicate of the corresponding condition (treated or untreated). Moreover, two of the treated and two of the untreated samples are from a paired-end sequencing assay, while the remaining samples are from a single-end sequencing experiment.

We have extracted sequences from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) files to build FASTQ files.

Both files contain the reads that belong to chromosome 4 of a paired-end sample. The sequences are raw sequences from the sequencing machine, without any pretreatments. They need to be controlled for their quality.

## Quality control

For quality control, we use similar tools as described in [NGS-QC tutorial](../../NGS-QC/tutorials/dive_into_qc): [FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and [Trim Galore](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/).

As the genome of *Drosophila melanogaster* is known and assembled, we can use this information and map the sequences on this genome to identify the effects of Pasilla gene depletion on splicing events.

# Mapping

To make sense of the reads, their positions within *Drosophila melanogaster* genome must be determined. This process is known as aligning or 'mapping' the reads to the reference genome.

> Do you want to learn more about the principles behind mapping? Follow our [training](../../NGS-mapping)
> {: .comment}

Because in the case of a eukaryotic transcriptome, most reads originate from processed mRNAs lacking exons, they cannot be simply mapped back to the genome as we normally do for DNA data. Instead the reads must be separated into two categories:

- Reads that map entirely within exons
- Reads that cannot be mapped within an exon across their entire length because they span two or more exons

Spliced mappers have been developed to efficiently map transcript-derived reads against genomes. [TopHat](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml) was one of the first tools designed specifically to address this problem:

1. Identification of potential exons using reads that do map to the genome
2. Generation of possible splices between neighboring exons
3. Comparison of reads that did not initially map to the genome against these *in silico* created junctions

![](../../images/tophat2.png)

*[Kim et al., Genome Biology, 2013](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2013-14-4-r36)*

Here, we will use HISAT2, a successor to TopHat2 that is faster with low memory requirements.

To run efficiently the mapping, HISAT2 needs to know on important parameters about the sequencing library: the library type.

This information should usually come with your FASTQ files, ask your sequencing facility! If not, try to find them on the site where you downloaded the data or in the corresponding publication. Another option is to estimate these parameters with a *preliminary mapping* of a *downsampled* file and some analysis programs. Afterward, the actual mapping can be redone on the original files with the optimized parameters.

## Preliminary mapping

In a preliminary mapping, we will estimate the library type to run HISAT2 efficiently afterwards.

{: .comment}

The library type corresponds to a protocol used to generate the data: which strand the RNA fragment is synthesized from.

![](../../images/strand_library_type.png)

*[Credit: Zhao Zhang](http://onetipperday.sterding.com/2012/07/how-to-tell-which-library-type-to-use.html)*

In the previous illustration, you could see that for example dUTP method is to only sequence the strand from the first strand synthesis (the original RNA strand is degradated due to the dUTP incorporated).

Examples of protocol | Description | Library Type (HISAT2)
--- | --- | ---
Standard Illumina | Reads from the left-most end of the fragment (in transcript coordinates) map to the transcript strand, and the right-most end maps to the opposite strand | Unstranded (default)
dUTP, NSR, NNSR | Same as above except we enforce the rule that the right-most end of the fragment (in transcript coordinates) is the first sequenced (or only sequenced for single-end reads). Equivalently, it is assumed that only the strand generated during first strand synthesis is sequenced. | First strand (FR/F)
Ligation, Standard SOLiD | Same as above except we enforce the rule that the left-most end of the fragment (in transcript coordinates) is the first sequenced (or only sequenced for single-end reads). Equivalently, it is assumed that only the strand generated during second strand synthesis is sequenced. | Second strand (RF/R)

If you do not know the library type, you can find it by yourself by mapping the reads on the reference genome and infer the library type from the mapping results by comparing reads mapping information to the annotation of the reference genome.

![](../../images/library_type_mapping.png)

The sequencer always read from 5' to 3'. So, in First Strand case, all reads from the left-most end of RNA fragment (always from 5' to 3') are mapped to transcript-strand, and (for pair-end sequencing) reads from the right-most end are always mapped to the opposite strand.

We can now try to determine the library type of our data.

After the mapping, we have in the generated mapping file the information about where the reads are mapped on the reference genome. So for each mapped read, we know where it is mapped and how good it was mapped.

The next step in the RNA-Seq data analysis is quantification of expression level of the genomic features (gene, transcript, exons, ...) to be able then to compare several samples for the different expression analysis. The quantification consist into taking each known genomic feature (*e.g.* gene) of the reference genome and then counting how many reads are mapped on this genomic feature. So, in this step, we start with an information per mapped reads to end with an information per genomic feature.

To identify exons that are regulated by the Pasilla gene, we need to identify genes and exons which are differentially expressed between samples with PS gene depletion and control samples.
In this tutorial, we will then analyze the differential gene expression, but also the differential exon usage.

# Analysis of the differential gene expression

We will first investigate the differential gene expression to identify which genes are impacted by the Pasilla gene depletion

## Count the number of reads per annotated gene

To compare the expression of single genes between different conditions (*e.g.* with or without PS depletion), an first essential step is to quantify the number of reads per gene. [**HTSeq-count**](http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/count.html) is one of the most popular tool for gene quantification.

To quantify the number of reads mapped to a gene, an annotation of the gene position is needed. We already upload on Galaxy the `Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP5.78.gtf` with the Ensembl gene annotation for *Drosophila melanogaster*.

In principle, the counting of reads overlapping with genomic features is a fairly simple task. But there are some details that need to be decided, such how to handle multi-mapping reads. **HTSeq-count** offers 3 choices ("union", "intersection_strict" and "intersection_nonempty") to handle read mapping to multiple locations, reads overlapping introns, or reads that overlap more than one genomic feature:

![](../../images/htseq_count.png)

*[HTSeq documentation](http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/count.html)*

The recommended mode is "union", which counts overlaps even if a read only shares parts of its sequence with a genomic feature and disregards reads that overlap more than one feature.

## Analysis of the differential gene expression

In the previous section, we counted only reads that mapped to genes of chromosome 4 and for only one sample. To be able to identify differential gene expression induced by PS depletion, all datasets (3 treated and 4 untreated) must be analyzed with the similar procedure and for whole genome.

For time and computer saving, we run the previous steps for you and obtain 7 count files, available on [Zenodo](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.290221).

These files contain for each gene of Drosophila the number of reads mapped to it. We could compare directly the files and then having the differential gene expression. But the number of sequenced reads mapped to a gene depends on:

- Its own expression level
- Its length
- The sequencing depth of the sample
- The expression of all other genes within the sample

Either for within or for inter-sample comparison, the gene counts need to be normalized. We can then use the Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis, whose two basic tasks are:

- Estimate the biological variance using the replicates for each condition
- Estimate the significance of expression differences between any two conditions

This expression analysis is estimated from read counts and attempts are made to correct for variability in measurements using replicates that are absolutely essential accurate results. For your own analysis, we advice you to use at least 3, better 5 biological replicates per condition. You can have different number of replicates per condition.

[**DESeq2**](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) is a great tool for DGE analysis. It takes read counts produced by **HTseq-count**, combine them into a big table (with gene in the rows and samples in the columns) and applies size factor normalization:

- Computation for each gene of the geometric mean of read counts across all samples
- Division of every gene count by the geometric mean
- Use of the median of these ratios as sample's size factor for normalization

Multiple factors with several levels can then be incorporated in the analysis. With the normalization, we can then compare with statistical liability the gene expression of different levels of a factor.

In our example, we have samples with two varying factors that can explain differences in gene expression:

- Treatment (either treated or untreated)
- Sequencing type (paired-end or single-end)

Here treatment is the primary factor which we are interested in. The sequencing type is some further information that we know about the data that might effect the analysis. This particular multi-factor analysis allows us to assess the effect of the treatment taking also the sequencing type into account.

The first output of **DESeq2** is a tabular file. The columns are:

1.	Gene identifiers
2.	Mean normalized counts, averaged over all samples from both conditions
3.	Logarithm (to basis 2) of the fold change


    The log2 fold changes are based on primary factor level 1 vs. factor level 2. The order of factor levels is then important. For example, for the factor 'Treatment', DESeq2 computes fold changes of 'treated' samples against 'untreated', *i.e.* the values correspond to up- or downregulations of genes in treated samples.

4.	Standard error estimate for the log2 fold change estimate
5.	[Wald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wald_test) statistic
6.	*p*-value for the statistical significance of this change
7.	*p*-value adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure which controls false discovery rate ([FDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate))

    This dispersion plot is typical, with the final estimates shrunk from the gene-wise estimates towards the fitted estimates. Some gene-wise estimates are flagged as outliers and not shrunk towards the fitted value. The amount of shrinkage can be more or less than seen here, depending on the sample size, the number of coefficients, the row mean and the variability of the gene-wise estimates.

## Analysis of the functional enrichment among differentially expressed genes

We have extracted genes that are differentially expressed in treated (with PS gene depletion) samples compared to untreated samples. We would like to know the functional enrichment among the differentially expressed genes.

The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery ([DAVID](https://david.ncifcrf.gov/)) provides a comprehensive set of functional annotation tools for investigators to understand the biological meaning behind large lists of genes.

The query to DAVID can be done only on 100 genes. So, we will need to select the ones where the most interested in.

# Inference of the differential exon usage

Now, we would like to know the differential exon usage between treated (PS depleted) and untreated samples using RNA-seq exon counts. We will rework on the mapping results we generated previously.

We will use [DEXSeq](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEXSeq.html). DEXSeq detects high sensitivity genes, and in many cases exons, that are subject to differential exon usage. But first, as for the differential gene expression, we need to count the number of reads mapping the exons.

## Count the number of reads per exon

This step is similar to the step of [counting the number of reads per annotated gene](#count-the-number-of-reads-per-annotated-gene). Here instead of HTSeq-count, we are using DEXSeq-Count.

## Differential exon usage

DEXSeq usage is similar to DESeq2. It uses similar statistics to find differentially used exons.

As for DESeq2, in the previous step, we counted only reads that mapped to exons on chromosome 4 and for only one sample. To be able to identify differential exon usage induced by PS depletion, all datasets (3 treated and 4 untreated) must be analyzed with the similar procedure. For time saving, we did that for you. The results are available on [Zenodo](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.290221):

- [dexseq.gtf](https://zenodo.org/record/290221/files/dexseq.gtf): the results of the running DEXSeq-count in 'Prepare annotation' mode
- Seven files, counts files generated in 'Count reads' mode

Similarly to DESeq2, DEXSeq generates a table with:

1.  Exon identifiers
2.  Gene identifiers
3.  Exon identifiers in the Gene
4.  Mean normalized counts, averaged over all samples from both conditions
5.  Logarithm (to basis 2) of the fold change

    The log2 fold changes are based on primary factor level 1 vs. factor level 2. The order of factor levels is then important. For example, for the factor 'Condition', DESeq2 computes fold changes of 'treated' samples against 'untreated', *i.e.* the values correspond to up- or downregulations of genes in treated samples.

6.  Standard error estimate for the log2 fold change estimate
7.  *p*-value for the statistical significance of this change
8.  *p*-value adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure which controls false discovery rate ([FDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate))

# Annotation of the result tables with gene information

Unfortunately, in the process of counting, we loose all the information of the gene except its identifiant. In order to get the information back to our final counting tables, we can use a tool to make the correspondance between identifiant and annotation.

# Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have analyzed real RNA sequencing data to extract useful information, such as which genes are up- or downregulated by depletion of the Pasilla gene and which genes are regulated by the Pasilla gene. To answer these questions, we analyzed RNA sequence datasets using a reference-based RNA-seq data analysis approach. This approach can be sum up with the following scheme:
