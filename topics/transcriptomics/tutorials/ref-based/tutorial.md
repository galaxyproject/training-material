# Introduction



In recent years, RNA sequencing (in short RNA-Seq) has become a very widely used technology to analyze the continuously changing cellular transcriptome, i.e. the set of all RNA molecules in one cell or a population of cells. One of the most common aims of RNA-Seq is the profiling of gene expression by identifying genes or molecular pathways that are differentially expressed (DE) between two or more biological conditions. This tutorial demonstrates a computational workflow for the detection of DE genes and pathways from RNA-Seq data by providing a complete analysis of an RNA-Seq experiment profiling *Drosophila* cells after the depletion of a regulatory gene.

In the study of {% cite brooks2011conservation %}, the authors identified genes and pathways regulated by the *Pasilla* gene (the *Drosophila* homologue of the mammalian splicing regulators Nova-1 and Nova-2 proteins) using RNA-Seq data. They depleted the *Pasilla* (*PS*) gene in *Drosophila melanogaster* by RNA interference (RNAi). Total RNA was then isolated and used to prepare both single-end and paired-end RNA-Seq libraries for treated (PS depleted) and untreated samples. These libraries were sequenced to obtain RNA-Seq reads for each sample. The RNA-Seq data for the treated and the untreated samples can be compared to identify the effects of *Pasilla* gene depletion on gene expression.

In this tutorial, we illustrate the analysis of the gene expression data step by step using 7 of the original datasets:

- 4 untreated samples: [GSM461176](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461176), [GSM461177](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461177), [GSM461178](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461178), [GSM461182](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461182)
- 3 treated samples (*Pasilla* gene depleted by RNAi): [GSM461179](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461179), [GSM461180](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461180), [GSM461181](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461181)

Each sample constitutes a separate biological replicate of the corresponding condition (treated or untreated). Moreover, two of the treated and two of the untreated samples are from a paired-end sequencing assay, while the remaining samples are from a single-end sequencing experiment.

# Data upload

In the first part of this tutorial we will use the files for 2 out of the 7 samples to demonstrate how to calculate read counts (a measure of the gene expression) from FASTQ files (quality control, mapping, read counting). We provide the FASTQ files for the other 5 samples if you want to reproduce the whole analysis later.

In the second part of the tutorial, read counts of all 7 samples are used to identify and visualize the DE genes, gene families and molecular pathways due to the depletion of the *PS* gene.

The reads are raw data from the sequencing machine without any pretreatments. They need to be assessed for their quality.

# Quality control

During sequencing, errors are introduced, such as incorrect nucleotides being called. These are due to the technical limitations of each sequencing platform. Sequencing errors might bias the analysis and can lead to a misinterpretation of the data. Adapters may also be present if the reads are longer than the fragments sequenced and trimming these may improve the number of reads mapped.

Sequence quality control is therefore an essential first step in your analysis. We will use similar tools as described in the ["Quality control" tutorial]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.md %}): [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) to create a report of sequence quality, [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/) ({% cite ewels2016multiqc %}) to aggregate generated reports and [Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html) ({% cite marcel2011cutadapt %}) to improve the quality of sequences via trimming and filtering.

Unfortunately the current version of multiQC (the tool we use to combine reports) does not support list of pairs collections.
We will first need to transform our the list of pairs to a simple list.

We should trim the reads to get rid of bases that were sequenced with high uncertainty (i.e. low quality bases) at the read ends, and also remove the reads of overall bad quality.

# Mapping

To make sense of the reads, we need to first figure out where the sequences originated from in the genome, so we can then determine to which genes they belong. When a reference genome for the organism is available, this process is known as aligning or "mapping" the reads to the reference. This is equivalent to solving a jigsaw puzzle, but unfortunately, not all pieces are unique.

{: .comment}

In this study, the authors used *Drosophila melanogaster* cells. We should therefore map the quality-controlled sequences to the reference genome of *Drosophila melanogaster*.

{% include topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/mapping/ref_genome_explanation.md answer_3="The genome of *Drosophila melanogaster* is known and assembled and it can be used as the reference genome in this analysis. Note that new versions of reference genomes may be released if the assembly improves, for this tutorial we are going to use the release 6 of the *Drosophila melanogaster* reference genome assembly [(dm6)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4383921/)."%}

With eukaryotic transcriptomes most reads originate from processed mRNAs lacking introns:

![Types of RNA-Seq reads](../../images/ref-based/rna-seq-reads.png "The types of RNA-seq reads (adaption of the Figure 1a from {% cite kim2015hisat %}): reads that mapped entirely within an exon (in red), reads spanning over 2 exons (in blue), read spanning over more than 2 exons (in purple)")

Therefore they cannot be simply mapped back to the genome as we normally do for DNA data. Spliced-awared mappers have been developed to efficiently map transcript-derived reads against a reference genome:

![Splice-aware alignment](../../images/transcriptomics_images/splice_aware_alignment.png "Principle of spliced mappers: (1) identification of the reads spanning a single exon, (2) identification of the splicing junctions on the unmapped reads")

> <details-title>More details on the different spliced mappers</details-title>
>
> Several spliced mappers have been developed over the past years to process the explosion of RNA-Seq data.
>
> [**TopHat**](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml) ({% cite trapnell2009tophat %}) was one of the first tools designed specifically to address this problem. In **TopHat** reads are mapped against the genome and are separated into two categories: (1) those that map, and (2) those that are initially unmapped (IUM). "Piles" of reads representing potential exons are extended in search of potential donor/acceptor splice sites and potential splice junctions are reconstructed. IUMs are then mapped to these junctions.

>
> To further optimize and speed up spliced read alignment, [**HISAT2**](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml) ({% cite kim2019graph %}) was developed. It uses a hierarchical graph [FM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-index) (HGFM) index, representing the entire genome and eventual variants, together with overlapping local indexes (each spanning ~57 kb) that collectively cover the genome and its variants. This allows to find initial seed locations for potential read alignments in the genome using global index and to rapidly refine these alignments using a corresponding local index:
>
> ![Hierarchical Graph FM index in HISAT/HISAT2](../../images/transcriptomics_images/hisat.png "Hierarchical Graph FM index in HISAT/HISAT2 (Figure S8 from {% cite kim2015hisat %})")
>
> A part of the read (blue arrow) is first mapped to the genome using the global FM index. **HISAT2** then tries to extend the alignment directly utilizing the genome sequence (violet arrow). In (**a**) it succeeds and this read is aligned as it completely resides within an exon. In (**b**) the extension hits a mismatch. Now **HISAT2** takes advantage of the local FM index overlapping this location to find the appropriate mapping for the remainder of this read (green arrow). The (**c**) shows a combination these two strategies: the beginning of the read is mapped using global FM index (blue arrow), extended until it reaches the end of the exon (violet arrow), mapped using local FM index (green arrow) and extended again (violet arrow).

> [**STAR** aligner](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) ({% cite dobin2013star %}) is a fast alternative for mapping RNA-Seq reads against a reference genome utilizing an uncompressed [suffix array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_array). It operates in two stages. In the first stage it performs a seed search:
>
> ![STAR's seed search](../../images/transcriptomics_images/star.png "STAR's seed search (Figure 1 from {% cite dobin2013star %})")
>
> Here a read is split between two consecutive exons. **STAR** starts to look for a maximum mappable prefix (MMP) from the beginning of the read until it can no longer match continuously. After this point it starts to look for a MMP for the unmatched portion of the read (**a**). In the case of mismatches (**b**) and unalignable regions (**c**) MMPs serve as anchors from which to extend alignments.
>
> At the second stage **STAR** stitches MMPs to generate read-level alignments that (contrary to MMPs) can contain mismatches and indels. A scoring scheme is used to evaluate and prioritize stitching combinations and to evaluate reads that map to multiple locations. **STAR** is extremely fast but requires a substantial amount of RAM to run efficiently.

According to the **MultiQC** report, about 80% of reads for both samples are mapped exactly once to the reference genome. We can proceed with the analysis since only percentages below 70% should be investigated for potential contamination. Both samples have a low (less than 10%) percentage of reads that mapped to multiple locations on the reference genome. This is in the normal range for Illumina short-read sequencing, but may be lower for newer long-read sequencing datasets that can span larger repeated regions in the reference genome.

The main output of **STAR** is a BAM file.

{% include topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/mapping/bam_explanation.md mapper="RNA STAR" %}

## Inspection of the mapping results

The BAM file contains information for all our reads, making it difficult to inspect and explore in text format. A powerful tool to visualize the content of BAM files is the Integrative Genomics Viewer (**IGV**, {% cite robinson2011integrative %}).

> #### Gene body coverage
>
> The different regions of a gene make up the gene body. It is important to check if read coverage is uniform across the gene body. For example, a bias towards the 5' end of genes could indicate degradation of the RNA. Alternatively, a 3' bias could indicate that the data is from a 3' assay. To assess this, we can use the **Gene Body Coverage** tool from the RSeQC ({% cite wang2012rseqc %}) tool suite. This tool scales all transcripts to 100 nucleotides (using a provided annotation file) and calculates the number of reads covering each (scaled) nucleotide position. As this tool is really slow, we will compute the coverage only on 200,000 random reads.

Before going further in counting and differential expression analysis, it may be interesting to check the distribution of reads across known gene features (exons, CDS, 5' UTR, 3' UTR, introns, intergenic regions). For example, a high number of reads mapping to intergenic regions may indicate the presence of DNA contamination.

After the mapping, we now have the information on where the reads are located on the reference genome and how well they were mapped. The next step in RNA-Seq data analysis is quantification of the number of reads mapped to genomic features (genes, transcripts, exons, ...).

> <comment-title></comment-title>
>
> The quantification depends on both the reference genome (the FASTA file) and its associated annotations (the GTF file). It is extremely important to use an annotation file that corresponds to the same version of the reference genome you used for the mapping (e.g. `dm6` here), as the chromosomal coordinates of genes are usually different amongst different reference genome versions.

Here we will focus on the genes, as we would like to identify the ones that are differentially expressed because of the Pasilla gene knockdown.

# Counting the number of reads per annotated gene

To compare the expression of single genes between different conditions (*e.g.* with or without PS depletion), an essential first step is to quantify the number of reads per gene, or more specifically the number of reads mapping to the exons of each gene.

Two main tools are available for read counting: [**HTSeq-count**](http://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.9.1/count.html) ({% cite anders2015htseq %}) or **featureCounts** ({% cite liao2013featurecounts %}). Additionally, **STAR** allows to count reads while mapping: its results are identical to those from **HTSeq-count**. While this output is sufficient for most analyses, **featureCounts** offers more customization on how to count reads (minimum mapping quality, counting reads instead of fragments, count transcripts instead of genes etc.).

Therefore we offer a parallel tutorial for the 2 methods which give very similar results.

{% include _includes/cyoa-choices.html option1="featureCounts" option2="STAR" default="featureCounts" %}

In principle, the counting of reads overlapping with genomic features is a fairly simple task. But there are some details that need to be given to **featureCounts** or to the output of **STAR**, e.g. the strandness.

## Estimation of the strandness

RNAs that are typically targeted in RNA-Seq experiments are single stranded (*e.g.*, mRNAs) and thus have polarity (5' and 3' ends that are functionally distinct). During a typical RNA-Seq experiment the information about strandness is lost after both strands of cDNA are synthesized, size selected, and converted into a sequencing library. However, this information can be quite useful for the read counting step, especially for reads located on the overlap of 2 genes that are on different strands.

![Why strandness?](../../images/ref-based/strandness_why.png "If strandess information was lost during library preparation, Read1 will be assigned to gene1 located on the forward strand but Read2 will be 'ambiguous' as it can be assigned to gene1 (forward strand) or gene2 (reverse strand).")

Some library preparation protocols create so-called *stranded* RNA-Seq libraries that preserve the strand information ({% cite levin2010comprehensive %} provides an excellent overview). In practice, with Illumina RNA-Seq protocols you are unlikely to encounter all of the possibilities described in this article. You will most likely deal with either:

- Unstranded RNA-Seq data
- Stranded RNA-Seq data generated by the use of specialized RNA isolation kits during sample preparation

>
> ![Relationship between DNA and RNA orientation](../../images/transcriptomics_images/dna_rna.png "Relationship between DNA and RNA orientation")
>
> The implication of stranded RNA-Seq is that you can distinguish whether the reads are derived from forward or reverse-encoded transcripts. In the following example, the counts for the gene Mrpl43 can only be efficiently estimated in a stranded library as most of it overlap the gene Peo1 in the reverse orientation:

> ![Stranded RNA-Seq data look like this](../../images/ref-based/igv_stranded_screenshot.png "Non-stranded (top) vs. reverse strand-specific (bottom) RNA-Seq read alignment (using IGV, forward mapping reads are red and reverse mapping reads are blue )")
>
> Depending on the approach, and whether one performs single-end or paired-end sequencing, there are multiple possibilities on how to interpret the results of the mapping of these reads to the genome:
>
> ![Effects of RNA-Seq library types](../../images/transcriptomics_images/rnaseq_library_type.png "Effects of RNA-Seq library types (Figure adapted from Sailfish documentation)")
{: .details}

This information should be provided with your FASTQ files, ask your sequencing facility! If not, try to find it on the site where you downloaded the data or in the corresponding publication.

![How to estimate the strandness?](../../images/ref-based/strandness_cases.png "In a stranded forward library, reads map mostly on the same strand as the genes. With stranded reverse library, reads map mostly on the opposite strand. With unstranded library, reads map on genes on both strands independently of the orientation of the gene.")

There are 3 ways to estimate strandness from **STAR** results (choose the one you prefer)

1. We can do a visual inspection of read strands on IGV (for Paired-end dataset it is less easy than with single read and when you have a lot of samples, this can be painful).

3. Another option is to estimate these parameters with a tool called **Infer Experiment** from the RSeQC ({% cite wang2012rseqc %}) tool suite.

    This tool takes the BAM files from the mapping, selects a subsample of the reads and compares their genome coordinates and strands with those of the reference gene model (from an annotation file). Based on the strand of the genes, it can gauge whether sequencing is strand-specific, and if so, how reads are stranded (forward or reverse).

    {: .hands_on}

    {% tool [Infer Experiment](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/nilesh/rseqc/rseqc_infer_experiment/2.6.4.1) %} tool generates one file with information on:
    - Paired-end or single-end library
    - Fraction of reads failed to determine
    - 2 lines
        - For single-end
            - `Fraction of reads explained by "++,--"`: the fraction of reads that assigned to forward strand
            - `Fraction of reads explained by "+-,-+"`: the fraction of reads that assigned to reverse strand
        - For paired-end
            - `Fraction of reads explained by "1++,1--,2+-,2-+"`: the fraction of reads that assigned to forward strand
            - `Fraction of reads explained by "1+-,1-+,2++,2--"`: the fraction of reads that assigned to reverse strand

    If the two "Fraction of reads explained by" numbers are close to each other, we conclude that the library is not a strand-specific dataset (or unstranded).

The main output of **featureCounts** is a table with the counts, i.e. the number of reads (or fragments in the case of paired-end reads) mapped to each gene (in rows, with their ID in the first column) in the provided annotation. **FeatureCount** generates also the **feature length** output datasets. We will need this file later on when we will run the **goseq** tool.
</div>

<div class="STAR" markdown="1">

As you chose to use the STAR flavor of the tutorial, we will use **STAR** to count reads.

As written above, during mapping, **STAR** counted reads for each gene provided in the gene annotation file (this was achieved by the option `Per gene read counts (GeneCounts)`). However, this output provides some statistics at the beginning and the counts for each gene depending on the library (unstranded is column 2, stranded forward is column 3 and stranded reverse is column 4).

We will reformat the output of **STAR** to be similar to the output of **featureCounts** (or other counting softwares) which is only 2 columns, one with IDs and the other one with counts.

Here we counted reads mapped to genes for two samples. It is really interesting to redo the same procedure on the other datasets, especially to check how parameters differ given the different type of data (single-end versus paired-end).

To be able to identify differential gene expression induced by PS depletion, all datasets (3 treated and 4 untreated) must be analyzed following the same procedure.

You might think we can just compare the count values in the files directly and calculate the extent of differential gene expression. However, it is not that simple.

Let's imagine we have RNA-Seq counts from 3 samples for a genome with 4 genes:

Gene | Sample 1 Counts | Sample 2 Counts | Sample 3 Counts
--- | --- | --- | ---
A (2kb) | 10 | 12 | 30
B (4kb) | 20 | 25 | 60
C (1kb) | 5 | 8 | 15
D (10kb) | 0 | 0 | 1

Sample 3 has more reads than the other replicates, regardless of the gene. It has a higher sequencing depth than the other replicates. Gene B is twice as long as gene A: it might explain why it has twice as many reads, regardless of replicates.

The number of sequenced reads mapped to a gene therefore depends on:

- The **sequencing depth** of the samples

    Samples sequenced with more depth will have more reads mapping to each genes

- The **length of the gene**

    Longer genes will have more reads mapping to them

To compare samples or gene expressions, the gene counts need to be normalized. We could use TPM (Transcripts Per Kilobase Million).

> **FPKM** (Fragments Per Kilobase Million) is very similar to RPKM. RPKM is used for single-end RNA-seq, while FPKM is used for paired-end RNA-seq. With single-end, every read corresponds to a single fragment that was sequenced. With paired-end RNA-seq, two reads of a pair are mapped from a single fragment, or if one read in the pair did not map, one read can correspond to a single fragment (in case we decided to keep these). FPKM keeps tracks of fragments so that one fragment with 2 reads is counted only once.

> In the example, TPM for gene A in Sample 1 is 3.33 and in sample 2 is 3.33. The same proportion of total reads maps then to gene A in both samples (0.33 here). Indeed, the sum of the TPMs in both samples adds up to the same number (10 here), the denominator required to calculate the proportions is then the same regardless of the sample, and so the proportion of reads for gene A (3.33/10 = 0.33) for both sample.

RNA-Seq is often used to compare one tissue type to another, for example, muscle vs. epithelial tissue. And it could be that there are a lot of muscle specific genes transcribed in muscle but not in the epithelial tissue. We call this a **difference in library composition**.

It is also possible to see a difference in library composition in the same tissue type after the knock out of a transcription factor.

Let's imagine we have RNA-Seq counts from 2 samples (same library size: 635 reads), for a genome with 6 genes. The genes have the same expression in both samples, except one: only Sample 1 transcribes gene D, at a high level (563 reads). As the library size is the same for both samples, sample 2 has 563 extra reads to be distributed over genes A, B, C, E and F.

Gene | Sample 1 | Sample 2
--- | --- | --- | ---
A | 30 | 235
B | 24 | 188
C | 0 | 0
D | 563 | 0
E | 5 | 39
F | 13 | 102
**Total** | 635 | 635

As a result, the read count for all genes except for genes C and D is really high in Sample 2. Nonetheless, the only differentially expressed gene is gene D.

TPM, RPKM or FPKM do not deal with these differences in library composition during normalization, but more complex tools, like DESeq2, do.

[**DESeq2**](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) ({% cite love2014moderated %}) is a great tool for dealing with RNA-seq data and running Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis. It takes read count files from different samples, combines them into a big table (with genes in the rows and samples in the columns) and applies normalization for **sequencing depth** and **library composition**. We do not need to account for gene length normalization does because we are comparing the counts between sample groups for the same gene.

DESeq2 also runs the Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis, which has two basic tasks:

- Estimate the biological variance using the replicates for each condition
- Estimate the significance of expression differences between any two conditions

This expression analysis is estimated from read counts and attempts are made to correct for variability in measurements using replicates, that are absolutely essential for accurate results. For your own analysis, we advise you to use at least 3, but preferably 5 biological replicates per condition. It is possible to have different numbers of replicates per condition.

> <details-title>Technical vs biological replicates</details-title>
>
> A technical replicate is an experiment which is performed once but measured several times (e.g. multiple sequencing of the same library). A biological replicate is an experiment performed (and also measured) several times.
>
> In our data, we have 4 biological replicates (here called samples) without treatment and 3 biological replicates with treatment (*Pasilla* gene depleted by RNAi).
>
> We recommend to combine the count tables for different technical replicates (but not for biological replicates) before a differential expression analysis (see [DESeq2 documentation](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#collapsing-technical-replicates))
{: .details}

Multiple factors with several levels can then be incorporated in the analysis describing known sources of variation (e.g. treatment, tissue type, gender, batches), with two or more levels representing the conditions for each factor. After normalization we can compare the response of the expression of any gene to the presence of different levels of a factor in a statistically reliable way.

In our example, we have samples with two varying factors that can contribute to differences in gene expression:

- Treatment (either treated or untreated)
- Sequencing type (paired-end or single-end)

Here, treatment is the primary factor that we are interested in. The sequencing type is further information we know about the data that might affect the analysis. Multi-factor analysis allows us to assess the effect of the treatment, while taking the sequencing type into account too.

> <comment-title></comment-title>
>
> We recommend that you add all factors you think may affect gene expression in your experiment. It can be the sequencing type like here, but it can also be the manipulation (if different persons are involved in the library preparation), other batch effects, etc...

DESeq2 requires to provide for each factor, counts of samples in each category. We will thus use tags on our collection of counts to easily select all samples belonging to the same category.

**DESeq2** generated 3 outputs:

- A table with the normalized counts for each gene (rows) in the samples (columns)
- A graphical summary of the results, useful to evaluate the quality of the experiment:

    1. A plot of the first 2 dimensions from a principal component analysis ([PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)), run on the normalized counts of the samples

        > <details-title>What is a PCA?</details-title>
        >
        > Let's imagine we have some beer bottles standing here on the table. We can describe each beer by its colour, its foam, by how strong it is, and so on. We can compose a whole list of different characteristics of each beer in a beer shop. But many of them will measure related properties and so will be redundant. If so, we should be able to summarize each beer with fewer characteristics. This is what PCA or principal component analysis does.
        >
        > With PCA, we do not just select some interesting characteristics and discard the others. Instead, we construct some new characteristics that summarize our list of beers well. These new characteristics are constructed using the old ones. For example, a new characteristic might be computed, e.g. foam size minus beer pH. They are linear combinations.
        >
        > In fact, PCA finds the best possible characteristics, the ones that summarize the list of beers. These characteristics can be used to find similarities between beers and group them.
        >
        > Going back to read counts, the PCA is run on the normalized counts for all the samples. Here, we would like to describe the samples based on the expression of the genes. So the characteristics are the number of reads mapped on each genes. We use them and linear combinations of them to represent the samples and their similarities.

        It shows the samples in the 2D plane spanned by their first two principal components. Each replicate is plotted as an individual data point. This type of plot is useful for visualizing the overall effect of experimental covariates and batch effects.

    2. Heatmap of the sample-to-sample distance matrix (with clustering) based on the normalized counts.

        The heatmap gives an overview of similarities and dissimilarities between samples: the color represents the distance between the samples. Dark blue means shorter distance, i.e. closer samples given the normalized counts.

    3. Dispersion estimates: gene-wise estimates (black), the fitted values (red), and the final maximum a posteriori estimates used in testing (blue)

        This dispersion plot is typical, with the final estimates shrunk from the gene-wise estimates towards the fitted estimates. Some gene-wise estimates are flagged as outliers and not shrunk towards the fitted value. The amount of shrinkage can be more or less than seen here, depending on the sample size, the number of coefficients, the row mean and the variability of the gene-wise estimates.

    4. Histogram of *p*-values for the genes in the comparison between the 2 levels of the 1st factor

    5. An [MA plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MA_plot):

        This displays the global view of the relationship between the expression change of conditions (log ratios, M), the average expression strength of the genes (average mean, A), and the ability of the algorithm to detect differential gene expression. The genes that passed the significance threshold (adjusted p-value < 0.1) are colored in red.

- A summary file with the following values for each gene:

    1. Gene identifiers
    2. Mean normalized counts, averaged over all samples from both conditions
    3. Fold change in log2 (logarithm base 2)

       The log2 fold changes are based on the primary factor level 1 vs factor level 2, hence the input order of factor levels is important. Here, DESeq2 computes fold changes of 'treated' samples against 'untreated' from the first factor 'Treatment', *i.e.* the values correspond to up- or downregulation of genes in treated samples.

    4. Standard error estimate for the log2 fold change estimate
    5. [Wald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wald_test) statistic
    6. *p*-value for the statistical significance of this change

    > <tip-title>What are p-values and what are they used for?</tip-title>

    > The p-value is a measure often used to determine whether or not a particular observation possesses statistical significance. Strictly speaking, the p-value is the probability that the data could have arisen randomly, assuming that the null hypothesis is correct. In the concrete case of RNA-Seq, the null hypothesis is that there is no differential gene expression. So a p-value of 0.13 for a particular gene indicates that, for that gene, assuming it is not differentially expressed, there is a 13% chance that any apparent differential expression could simply be produced by random variation in the experimental data.
    >
    > 13% is still quite high, so we cannot really be confident differential gene expression is taking place. The most common way that scientists use p-values is to set a threshold (commonly 0.05, sometimes other values such as 0.01) and reject the null hypothesis only for p-values below this value. Thus, for genes with p-values less than 0.05, we can feel safe stating that differential gene expression plays a role. It should be noted that any such threshold is arbitrary and there is no meaningful difference between a p-value of 0.049 and 0.051, even if we only reject the null hypothesis in the first case.
    >
    > Unfortunately, p-values are often heavily misused in scientific research, enough so that Wikipedia provides a [dedicated article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misuse_of_p-values) on the subject. See also [this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/not-even-scientists-can-easily-explain-p-values/) (aimed at a general, non-scientific audience).

We now have a table with 130 lines corresponding to the most differentially expressed genes. For each gene, we have its ID, its mean normalized counts (averaged over all samples from both conditions), its $$log_{2} FC$$ and other information.

The ID for each gene is something like FBgn0003360, which is an ID from the corresponding database, here Flybase ({% cite thurmond2018flybase %}). These IDs are unique but sometimes we prefer to have the gene names, even if they may not reference an unique gene (e.g. duplicated after re-annotation). But gene names may hint already to a function or they help you to search for desired candidates. We would also like to display the location of these genes within the genome. We can extract such information from the annotation file which we used for mapping and counting.

## Visualization of the expression of the differentially expressed genes

We could plot the $$log_{2} FC$$ for the extracted genes, but here we would like to look at a heatmap of expression for these genes in the different samples. So we need to extract the normalized counts for these genes.

We proceed in several steps:

- Extract and plot the normalized counts for these genes for each sample with a heatmap, using the normalized count file generated by DESeq2
- Compute, extract and plot the Z-score of the normalized counts

### Visualization of the normalized counts

To extract the normalized counts for the interesting genes, we join the normalized count table generated by DESeq2 with the table we just generated. We will then keep only the columns corresponding to the normalized counts.

We now have a table with 131 lines (the 130 most differentially expressed genes and a header) and the normalized counts for these genes across the 7 samples.

### Visualization of the Z-score

To compare the gene expression over samples, we could also use the Z-score, which is often represented in publications.

The Z-score gives the number of standard-deviations that a value is away from the mean of all the values in the same group, here the same gene. A Z-score of -2 for the gene X in sample A means that this value is 2 standard-deviations lower than the mean of the values for gene X in all the samples (A, B, C, etc).

The Z-score $$z_{i,j}$$ for a gene $$i$$ in a sample $$j$$ given the normalized count $$x_{i,j}$$ is computed as $$z_{i,j} = \frac{x_{i,j}- \overline{x_i}}{s_i}$$ with $$\overline{x_i}$$ the mean and $$s_i$$ the standard deviation of the normalized counts for the gene $$i$$ over all samples.

# Functional enrichment analysis of the DE genes

We have extracted genes that are differentially expressed in treated (PS gene-depleted) samples compared to untreated samples. Now, we would like to know if the differentially expressed genes are enriched transcripts of genes which belong to more common or specific categories in order to identify biological functions that might be impacted.

## Gene Ontology analysis

[Gene Ontology (GO)](http://www.geneontology.org/) analysis is widely used to reduce complexity and highlight biological processes in genome-wide expression studies. However, standard methods give biased results on RNA-Seq data due to over-detection of differential expression for long and highly-expressed transcripts.

[**goseq**](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/goseq/inst/doc/goseq.pdf) ({% cite young2010gene %}) provides methods for performing GO analysis of RNA-Seq data while taking length bias into account. **goseq** could also be applied to other category-based tests of RNA-Seq data, such as KEGG pathway analysis, as discussed in a further section.

**goseq** needs 2 files as inputs:

- A tabular file with the differentially expressed genes from all genes assayed in the RNA-Seq experiment with 2 columns:
  - the Gene IDs (unique within the file), in uppercase letters
  - a boolean indicating whether the gene is differentially expressed or not (`True` if differentially expressed or `False` if not)
- A file with information about the length of a gene to correct for potential length bias in differentially expressed genes

We just generated the first input for **goseq**. As second input for **goseq** we need the gene lengths. We can use here the gene lengths generated by **featureCounts**  or **Gene length and GC content** and format the gene IDs.

## KEGG pathways analysis

**goseq** can also be used to identify interesting KEGG pathways. The KEGG pathway database is a collection of pathway maps representing current knowledge of molecular interaction, reaction and relation networks. A map can integrate many entities including genes, proteins, RNAs, chemical compounds, glycans, and chemical reactions, as well as disease genes and drug targets.

For example, the pathway `dme00010` represents the glycolysis process (conversion of glucose into pyruvate with generation of small amounts of ATP and NADH) for Drosophila melanogaster:

![dme00010 KEGG pathway](../../images/ref-based/dme00010_empty.png)

2. A table with the differentially expressed genes (from the list we provided) associated with the KEGG pathways (`DE genes for categories (GO/KEGG terms)`)

We could investigate which genes are involved in which pathways by looking at the second file generated by **goseq**. However, this can be cumbersome and we would like to see the pathways as represented in the previous image. **Pathview** ({% cite luo2013pathview %}) can help to automatically generate similar images to the previous one, while also adding extra information about the genes (e.g. expression) in our study.

This tool needs 2 main inputs:

- Pathway ID(s) to plot, either as just one ID or as a file with one column with the pathway IDs
- A tabular file with the genes in the RNA-Seq experiment with 2 (or more) columns:
  - the gene IDs (unique within the file)
  - some information about the genes

    This can be for example a p-value or a fold change. This information will be added to the pathway plot: the node of the corresponding gene will be colored given the value. If there are different columns, the different information will be plotted side by side on the node.

Here we would like to visualize the 2 KEGG pathways: the over-represented `00010` (Glycolysis / Gluconeogenesis) and the under-represented `03040` (Spliceosome). We would like the gene nodes to be colored by Log2 Fold Change for the differentially expressed genes because of the treatment.

# Inference of the differential exon usage

Next, we would like to know the differential exon usage between treated (PS depleted) and untreated samples using RNA-Seq exon counts. We will rework the mapping results we generated previously.

We will use [DEXSeq](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEXSeq.html). DEXSeq detects high sensitivity genes, and in many cases exons, that are subject to differential exon usage. But first, as for the differential gene expression, we need to count the number of reads mapping to the exons.

## Count the number of reads per exon

This step is similar to the step of [counting the number of reads per annotated gene](#count-the-number-of-reads-per-annotated-gene) except that, instead of HTSeq-count, we are using DEXSeq-Count.

DEXSeq generates a count table similar to the one generated by featureCounts, but with counts for exons.

## Differential exon usage

DEXSeq usage is similar to DESeq2. It uses similar statistics to find differentially used exons.

As for DESeq2, in the previous step, we counted only reads that mapped to exons on chromosome 4 and for only one sample. To be able to identify differential exon usage induced by PS depletion, all datasets (3 treated and 4 untreated) must be analyzed following the same procedure. To save time, we did that for you. The results are available on [Zenodo]({{ page.zenodo_link }}):

- The results of running DEXSeq-count in 'Prepare annotation' mode
- Seven count files generated in 'Count reads' mode

Similarly to DESeq2, DEXSeq generates a table with:

1. Exon identifiers
2. Gene identifiers
3. Exon identifiers in the Gene
4. Mean normalized counts, averaged over all samples from both conditions
5. Logarithm (to basis 2) of the fold change

   The log2 fold changes are based on primary factor level 1 vs. factor level 2. The order of factor levels is then important. For example, for the factor 'Condition', DESeq2 computes fold changes of 'treated' samples against 'untreated', *i.e.* the values correspond to up- or downregulations of genes in treated samples.

6. Standard error estimate for the log2 fold change estimate
7. *p*-value for the statistical significance of this change
8. *p*-value adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure which controls false discovery rate ([FDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate))

# Conclusion



In this tutorial, we have analyzed real RNA sequencing data to extract useful information, such as which genes are up or downregulated by depletion of the *Pasilla* gene, but also which GO terms or KEGG pathways they are involved in. To answer these questions, we analyzed RNA sequence datasets using a reference-based RNA-Seq data analysis approach. This approach can be summarized with the following scheme:
