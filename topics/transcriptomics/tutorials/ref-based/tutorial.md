# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

In the study of [Brooks *et al.* 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3032923/), the *Pasilla* (*PS*) gene, *Drosophila* homologue of the Human splicing regulators Nova-1 and Nova-2 Proteins, was depleted in *Drosophila melanogaster* by RNAi. The authors wanted to identify exons that are regulated by *Pasilla* gene using RNA sequencing data.

Total RNA was isolated and used for preparing either single-end or paired-end RNA-seq libraries for treated (PS depleted) samples and untreated samples. These libraries were sequenced to obtain a collection of RNA sequencing reads for each sample. The effects of *Pasilla* gene depletion on splicing events can then be analyzed by comparison of RNA sequencing data of the treated (PS depleted) and the untreated samples.

The genome of *Drosophila melanogaster* is known and assembled. It can be used as reference genome to ease this analysis.  In a reference based RNA-seq data analysis, the reads are aligned (or mapped) against a reference genome, *Drosophila melanogaster* here, to significantly improve the ability to reconstruct transcripts and then identify differences of expression between several conditions.

# Pretreatments

## Data upload

The original data is available at NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number [GSE18508](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE18508).

We will look at the 7 first samples:

- 3 treated samples with *Pasilla* (PS) gene depletion: [GSM461179](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461179), [GSM461180](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461180), [GSM461181](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461181)
- 4 untreated samples: [GSM461176](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461176), [GSM461177](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461177), [GSM461178](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461178), [GSM461182](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM461182)

Each sample constitutes a separate biological replicate of the corresponding condition (treated or untreated). Moreover, two of the treated and two of the untreated samples are from a paired-end sequencing assay, while the remaining samples are from a single-end sequencing experiment.

We have extracted sequences from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) files to build FASTQ files.

The sequences are raw data from the sequencing machine, without any pretreatments. They need to be assessed for their quality.

## Quality control

For quality control, we use similar tools as described in [NGS-QC tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/sequence-analysis): [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and [Trim Galore](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/).

This ensures that the information of a read pair is not lost entirely if only one read is of good quality.

As the genome of *Drosophila melanogaster* is known and assembled, we can use this information and map the sequences on this genome to identify the effects of *Pasilla* gene depletion on splicing events.

# Mapping

To make sense of the reads, we need to determine to which genes they belong. The first step is to determine their positions within the *Drosophila melanogaster* genome. This process is known as aligning or 'mapping' the reads to a reference.

{: .comment}

Because in the case of a eukaryotic transcriptome, most reads originate from processed mRNAs lacking introns, they cannot be simply mapped back to the genome as we normally do for DNA data. Instead the reads must be separated into two categories:

- Reads that map entirely within exons
- Reads that cannot be mapped within an exon across their entire length because they span two or more exons

![Five types of RNA-seq reads](../../images/five_type_rna_seq_reads.png "The five types of RNA-seq reads (Figure 1a from Kim et al, Nat Methods, 2015)")

Spliced mappers have been developed to efficiently map transcript-derived reads against genomes:

In TopHat reads are mapped against the genome and are separated into two categories: (1) those that map, and (2) those that initially unmapped (IUM). "Piles" of reads representing potential exons are extended in search of potential donor/acceptor splice sites and potential splice junctions are reconstructed. IUMs are then mapped to these junctions.

It uses a set of [FM-indices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-index) consisting one global genome-wide index and a collection of ~48,000 local overlapping 42 kb indices (~55,000 56 kb indices in HISAT2). This allows to find initial seed locations for potential read alignments in the genome using global index and to rapidly refine these alignments using a corresponding local index:

> A part of the read (blue arrow) is first mapped to the genome using the global FM index. The HISAT then tries to extend the alignment directly utilizing the genome sequence (violet arrow). In (**a**) it succeeds and this read aligned as it completely resides within an exon. In (**b**) the extension hits a mismatch. Now HISAT takes advantage of the local FM index overlapping this location to find the appropriate mapping for the remainder of this read (green arrow). The (**c**) shows a combination these two strategies: the beginning of the read is mapped using global FM index (blue arrow), extended until it reaches the end of the exon (violet arrow), mapped using local FM index (green arrow) and extended again (violet arrow).

>    ![STAR's seed search](../../images/star.png "STAR's seed search (Dobin et al, Bioinformatics, 2013)")
>
> Here a read is split between two consecutive exons. STAR starts to look for a maximum mappable prefix (MMP) from the beginning of the read until it can no longer match continuously. After this point it start to MMP for the unmatched portion of the read (**a**). In the case of mismatches (**b**) and unalignable regions (**c**) MMPs serve as anchors from which to extend alignments</p>
>
> At the second stage STAR stitches MMPs to generate read-level alignments that (contrary to MMPs) can contain mismatches and indels. A scoring scheme is used to evaluate and prioritize stitching combinations and to evaluate reads that map to multiple locations. STAR is extremely fast but requires a substantial amount of RAM to run efficiently.

## Inspection of the mapping results

The BAM file contains information about where the reads are mapped on the reference genome. But it is a binary file and with the information for more than 3 million reads encoded in it, it is difficult to inspect and explore the file.

A powerful tool to visualize the content of BAM files is the Integrative Genomics Viewer IGV.

After the mapping, we have the information on where the reads are located on the reference genome. We also know how well they were mapped.

The next step in the RNA-Seq data analysis is quantification of expression level of the genomic features (gene, transcript, exons, ...) to be able then to compare several samples for the different expression analysis. The quantification consist into taking each known genomic feature (*e.g.* gene) of the reference genome and then counting how many reads are mapped on this genomic feature. So, in this step, we start with an information per mapped reads to end with an information per genomic feature.

> The quantification depends on the definition of the genomic features of the reference genome, and then on the annotations. We strongly recommend you to use an annotation corresponding to the same version of the reference genome you used for the mapping.
{: .comment}

To identify exons that are regulated by the *Pasilla* gene, we need to identify genes and exons which are differentially expressed between samples with PS gene depletion and control samples.
In this tutorial, we will then analyze the differential gene expression, but also the differential exon usage.

Did mapping exercise work for you? Great! :tada:

# Analysis of the differential gene expression

We will first investigate the differential gene expression to identify which genes are impacted by the *Pasilla* gene depletion

## Count the number of reads per annotated gene

To compare the expression of single genes between different conditions (*e.g.* with or without PS depletion), an essential first step is to quantify the number of reads per gene. 

![Counting the number of reads per annotated gene](../../images/gene_counting.png "Counting the number of reads per annotated gene")

Two main tools could be used for that: [HTSeq-count](http://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.9.1/count.html) ([Anders et al, Bioinformatics, 2015](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/2/166/2366196)) or featureCounts ([Liao et al, Bioinformatics, 2014](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/2/166/2366196)). The second one is considerably faster and requires far less computational resources. We will use it.

In principle, the counting of reads overlapping with genomic features is a fairly simple task. But there are some details that need to be given to featureCounts: for example the strandness...

### Estimation of the strandness

RNAs that are typically targeted in RNAseq experiments are single stranded (*e.g.*, mRNAs) and thus have polarity (5' and 3' ends that are functionally distinct):

![Relationship between DNA and RNA orientation](../../images/dna_rna.png "Relationship between DNA and RNA orientation")

During a typical RNAseq experiment the information about strandedness is lost after both strands of cDNA are synthesized, size selected, and converted into sequencing library. However, this information can be quite useful for the read counting.

Some library preparation protocols create so called *stranded* RNAseq libraries that preserve the strand information (an excellent overview in [Levin et al, Nat Meth, 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3005310/)). The implication of stranded RNAseq is that you can distinguish whether the reads are derived from forward- or reverse-encoded transcripts:

![Stranded RNAseq data look like this](../../images/stranded_result.png "How do stranded RNAseq data look like (image from GATC Biotech)")

Depending on the approach and whether one performs single- or paired-end sequencing there are multiple possibilities on how to interpret the results of mapping of these reads onto the genome:

![Effects of RNAseq library types](../../images/rnaseq_library_type.png "Effects of RNAseq library types (adapted from Sailfish documentation)")

In practice, with Illumina paired-end RNAseq protocols, you are unlikely to uncover many of these possibilities. You will either deal with:

- Unstranded RNAseq data
- Stranded RNAseq data produced with Illumina TrueSeq RNAseq kits and [dUTP tagging](https://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/37/18/e123) (**ISR**)

This information should usually come with your FASTQ files, ask your sequencing facility! If not, try to find them on the site where you downloaded the data or in the corresponding publication.

Another option is to estimate these parameters with a tool called **Infer Experiment**. This tool takes the output of your mappings (BAM files), takes a subsample of your reads and compares their genome coordinates and strands with those of the reference gene model (from an annotation file). Based on the strand of the genes, it can gauge whether sequencing is strand-specific, and if so, how reads are stranded.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Determining the library strandness
>
> 1. **Infer Experiment** {% icon tool %}: Determine the library strandness with:
>    - "Input .bam file" to the STAR-generated `BAM` files (multiple datasets)
>    - "Reference gene model" to `Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.87.gtf`
>    - "Number of reads sampled from SAM/BAM file (default = 200000)" to `200000`
{: .hands_on}

The tool generates one file with:
- Paired-end or singled-end library
- Fraction of reads failed to determine
- 2 lines
    - For single-end
        - Fraction of reads explained by "++,--" (**SF** in previous figure)
        - Fraction of reads explained by "+-,-+" (**SR** in previous figure)
    - For paired-end
        - Fraction of reads explained by "1++,1--,2+-,2-+" (**SF** in previous figure)
        - Fraction of reads explained by "1+-,1-+,2++,2--" (**SR** in previous figure) 

If the fractions in the two last lines are too close to each other, we conclude that this is the library is not specific to a strand specific dataset (**U** in previous figure).

## Identification of the differentially expressed features

In the previous section, we counted reads that mapped to genes for two sample. To be able to identify differential gene expression induced by PS depletion, all datasets (3 treated and 4 untreated) must be analyzed following the same procedure and for the whole genome.

{: .hands_on}

To save time, we have run the necessary steps for you and obtained 7 count files, available on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1185122).

These files contain for each gene of *Drosophila* the number of reads mapped to it. We could compare the files directly and calculate the extent of differential gene expression, but the number of sequenced reads mapped to a gene depends on:

- Its own expression level
- Its length
- The sequencing depth of the sample
- The expression of all other genes within the sample

Either for within- or for between-sample comparison, the gene counts need to be normalized. We can then use the Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis, whose two basic tasks are:

- Estimate the biological variance using the replicates for each condition
- Estimate the significance of expression differences between any two conditions

This expression analysis is estimated from read counts and attempts are made to correct for variability in measurements using replicates that are absolutely essential for accurate results. For your own analysis, we advice you to use at least 3, but preferably 5 biological replicates per condition. You can have different number of replicates per condition.

[**DESeq2**](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) is a great tool for DGE analysis. It takes read counts produced previously, combines them into a big table (with genes in the rows and samples in the columns) and applies size factor normalization:

- Computation for each gene of the geometric mean of read counts across all samples
- Division of every gene count by the geometric mean
- Use of the median of these ratios as a sample's size factor for normalization

Multiple factors with several levels can then be incorporated in the analysis. After normalization we can compare, in a statistically reliable way, the response of the expression of any gene to the presence of different levels of a factor.

In our example, we have samples with two varying factors that can explain differences in gene expression:

- Treatment (either treated or untreated)
- Sequencing type (paired-end or single-end)

Here treatment is the primary factor which we are interested in. The sequencing type is some further information that we know about the data that might affect the analysis. This particular multi-factor analysis allows us to assess the effect of the treatment, while taking the sequencing type into account, too.

**DESeq2** generated 3 outputs

- A table with the normalized counts for each genes (rows) and each samples (columns)
- A graphical summary of the results, useful to evaluate the quality of the experiment:

    1. Histogram of *p*-values for all tests
    2. [MA plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MA_plot): global view of the relationship between the expression change of conditions (log ratios, M), the average expression strength of the genes (average mean, A), and the ability of the algorithm to detect differential gene expression. The genes that passed the significance threshold (adjusted p-value < 0.1) are colored in red.
    3. Principal Component Analysis ([PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)) and the first two axes

        Each replicate is plotted as an individual data point. This type of plot is useful for visualizing the overall effect of experimental covariates and batch effects.

    5. Dispersion estimates: gene-wise estimates (black), the fitted values (red), and the final maximum a posteriori estimates used in testing (blue)

        This dispersion plot is typical, with the final estimates shrunk from the gene-wise estimates towards the fitted estimates. Some gene-wise estimates are flagged as outliers and not shrunk towards the fitted value. The amount of shrinkage can be more or less than seen here, depending on the sample size, the number of coefficients, the row mean and the variability of the gene-wise estimates.

- A summary file with the following values for each gene

    1.  Gene identifiers
    2.  Mean normalized counts, averaged over all samples from both conditions
    3.  Logarithm (to basis 2) of the fold change

        The log2 fold changes are based on primary factor level 1 vs. factor level 2, hence the order of factor levels is important. For example, for the factor 'Treatment', DESeq2 computes fold changes of 'treated' samples against 'untreated', *i.e.* the values correspond to up- or downregulation of genes in treated samples.

    4.  Standard error estimate for the log2 fold change estimate
    5.  [Wald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wald_test) statistic
    6.  *p*-value for the statistical significance of this change
    7.  *p*-value adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure which controls false discovery rate ([FDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate))

## Visualization of the differentially expressed genes

We would like now to draw an heatmap of the normalized counts for each sample for the most differentially expressed genes.

We would proceed in several steps

We now have a table with 20 lines corresponding to the most differentially expressed genes. And for each of the gene, we have its id, its mean normalized counts (averaged over all samples from both conditions), its log<sub>2</sub>FC and other information.

We could plot the log<sub>2</sub>FC for the different genes, but here we would like to look at the heatmap with the read counts for these genes in the different samples. So we need to extract the read counts for these genes.

We will join the normalized count table generated by DESeq with the table we just generated to conserved in the normalized count table only the lines corresponding to the most differentially expressed genes

## Analysis of the functional enrichment among the differentially expressed genes

We have extracted genes that are differentially expressed in treated (with PS gene depletion) samples compared to untreated samples. We would like to know the functional enrichment among the differentially expressed genes.

[Gene Ontology (GO)](http://www.geneontology.org/) analysis is widely used to reduce complexity and highlight biological processes in genome-wide expression studies, but standard methods give biased results on RNA-seq data due to over-detection of differential expression for long and highly expressed transcripts.

[goseq tool](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/goseq/inst/doc/goseq.pdf) provides methods for performing GO analysis of RNA-seq data, taking length bias into account. The methods and software used by goseq are equally applicable to other category based tests of RNA-seq data, such as KEGG pathway analysis.

goseq needs 2 files as inputs:
- A tabular file with the differentially expressed genes from all genes assayed in the RNA-seq experiment with 2 columns:
    - the Gene IDs (unique within the file)
    - True (differentially expressed) or False (not differentially expressed)
- A file with information about the length of a gene to correct for potential length bias in differentially expressed genes

# Inference of the differential exon usage

Next, we would like to know the differential exon usage between treated (PS depleted) and untreated samples using RNA-seq exon counts. We will rework on the mapping results we generated previously.

We will use [DEXSeq](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEXSeq.html). DEXSeq detects high sensitivity genes, and in many cases exons, that are subject to differential exon usage. But first, as for the differential gene expression, we need to count the number of reads mapping to the exons.

## Count the number of reads per exon

This step is similar to the step of [counting the number of reads per annotated gene](#count-the-number-of-reads-per-annotated-gene) except that, instead of HTSeq-count, we are using DEXSeq-Count.

## Differential exon usage

DEXSeq usage is similar to DESeq2. It uses similar statistics to find differentially used exons.

As for DESeq2, in the previous step, we counted only reads that mapped to exons on chromosome 4 and for only one sample. To be able to identify differential exon usage induced by PS depletion, all datasets (3 treated and 4 untreated) must be analyzed following the same procedure. To save time, we did that for you.

Similarly to DESeq2, DEXSeq generates a table with:

1.  Exon identifiers
2.  Gene identifiers
3.  Exon identifiers in the Gene
4.  Mean normalized counts, averaged over all samples from both conditions
5.  Logarithm (to basis 2) of the fold change

    The log2 fold changes are based on primary factor level 1 vs. factor level 2. The order of factor levels is then important. For example, for the factor 'Condition', DESeq2 computes fold changes of 'treated' samples against 'untreated', *i.e.* the values correspond to up- or downregulations of genes in treated samples.

6.  Standard error estimate for the log2 fold change estimate
7.  *p*-value for the statistical significance of this change
8.  *p*-value adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure which controls false discovery rate ([FDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate))

# Annotation of the result tables with gene information

Unfortunately, in the process of counting, we loose all the information of the gene except its identifiant. In order to get the information back to our final counting tables, we can use a tool to make the correspondance between identifiant and annotation.

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

In this tutorial, we have analyzed real RNA sequencing data to extract useful information, such as which genes are up- or downregulated by depletion of the *Pasilla* gene and which genes are regulated by the *Pasilla* gene. To answer these questions, we analyzed RNA sequence datasets using a reference-based RNA-seq data analysis approach. This approach can be summarized with the following scheme:
