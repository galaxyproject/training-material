# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

<!-- This is a comment. -->

With the advances in the next-generation sequencing technologies, genome-wide RNA-RNA interaction predictions are now
possible. The most recent line of development has been to ligate the microRNA to the site-specific interaction region of
 the target, selecting these interactions via cross-linking to one of the Argonaute proteins required for microRNA-based
  regulation, and to sequence the resulting chimeric RNA molecule, for example, the CLASH and CLEAR-CLIP protocols.
Going beyond microRNAs, these protocols can be applied to RNA interactions that involve a regulatory protein
other than Argonaute. To generalize even further, researchers have applied the same idea to the detection of all
transcriptome-wide RNA-RNA interactions, which include both inter- and intramolecular base pairing without the necessity
 of choosing a specific regulatory protein for cross-linking. These protocols include LIGR-Seq that maps the human
 RNA-RNA interactome and PARIS that focused on long-range structures in human and mouse.

The reads from these experiments are chimeric with each arm generated from one of the interaction
partners. Due to short lengths, often these sequenced arms ambiguously map to multiple locations and  inferring the
origin of these can be quite complicated. Theoretically, alignment tools like `HISAT2` and `STAR` can be used to align
chimeric reads, but they are not efficient at this task. The other alignment tools like `BWA-MEM` or `Bowtie2` can be
used in local alignment settings to map these chimeric reads. In this case user needs to adjust the alignment parameters
to match the read lengths and there needs to be a lot of post-processing to be done to choose the best hits. Recently,
there is also an alignment tool called `CLAN` published to specifically map the chimeric reads from CLASH experiments.

In this tutorial, we will learn the analysis of a CLEAR-CLIP data set using a tool suite called `ChiRA`. The data used
is from mouse cortex sample
([GSM1881541](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM1881541)) prepared using CLEAR-CLIP protocol. It is
a complete analysis framework that can be used starting from raw sequencing reads to analysis and visualization of
results. `ChiRA` uses `BWA-MEM` or `CLAN` to map the reads. Subsequently, it also merges the overlappig alignments and
 chooses the best alignments per read by quantifying the all the loci that reads map to. In the end, it scores each
  alignment and outputs only the best alignments per read. The final part of this tutorial gives an insight into how to
  filter, export and visualize your results using the visualization framework `ChiRAViz`.

# Preprocessing

Before starting with the analysis of data it is always good to check the sequenced reads for low quality bases and
adapters.

## Quality control

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Quality check
First use `FastQC` to assess the read quality
>

library preparation are not present in the `FastQC` standard adapters list.

## Adapter trimming
Due to the inefficiency of the current RNA interactome protocols, not all reads are not made up of RNA hybrids. In some
cases, reads contain single RNA fragments with adapters or nothing but only adapters. Hence adapter removal is a very important step
in this analysis. In this step, we use `cutadapt` to trim the adapters. As the adapters used in this library are not
standard Illumina adapters, we need to provide them manually.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Adapter trimming

> > 1. Normally yes, but in this case not. Always look at this plot in combination with "Sequence Length Distribution"
plot. It looks like there is huge difference in base composition after 55th base. But the number of
sequences that constitute this is very important. From the sequence length distribution, most of the sequences are
 between 53 and 57 bases long. We see the abnormality in the per base sequence content because it is from
 very few sequences.

# Analysis of interactome data using `ChiRA` tool suite

The analysis includes several steps that deal with deduplication mapping, quantification and extraction of interacting
partners.

## Remove duplicate sequences

First, we eliminate the duplicate sequences from the library to reduce the computational effort. This will also have an
impact on the quantification of the loci because often these identical sequences might be PCR duplicates. There is also
a 5' degenerate linker of length 5 nucleotides present in the reads. Hence we have to strip that too.

>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Input FASTQ file"*: `Read 1 Output` (output of **cutadapt** {% icon tool %})

>    > * The UMI will be trimmed and put in the unique sequence id.
>    {: .tip}
>
{: .hands_on}


## Map reads to the reference transcriptome

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Map chimeric reads from fasta file
Here we use `BWA-MEM` aligner in local alignment mode to locate the chimeric arms on the
transcriptome. Your reference can be single or split in two. Two references are
ideal for example if you have CLASH experimental data where you have separate
miRNA and target references.
>
> 1. **ChiRA map** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Input FASTA file"*: `fasta file` (output of **ChiRA collapse** {% icon tool %})
>    - *"Single or split reference?"*: `Split reference`
>        - {% icon param-file %} *"Reference FASTA file"*: `miRNA_mature.fa.gz` (Input dataset)
>        - {% icon param-file %} *"Second reference FASTA file"*: `transcriptome.fa.gz` (Input dataset)
>    - *"aligner"*: `BWA-MEM`
>
{: .hands_on}


## Merge overlapping alignment information

In this step, we merge the overlapping aligned positions to define the read concentrated loci. If an annotation GTF file
produced, the transcriptomic alignment positions are first converted to their corresponding genomic positions. The
merging is also done on reads defining which parts of the reads are mapping that indicates potential interacting segments
of read.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on:

> 1. **ChiRA merge** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Input BED file of alignments"*: `ChiRA aligned BED` (output of **ChiRA map** {% icon tool %})
>    - *"Do you have an annotation in GTF format?"*: `Yes`
>        - {% icon param-file %} *"Annotations in GTF format"*: `whole_transcriptome.gff.gz` (Input dataset)
>    - *"Did you use single or split reference for alignment?"*: `Split reference`

>        - {% icon param-file %} *"Second reference FASTA file"*: `transcriptome.fa.gz` (Input dataset)
>
>    > ### {% icon tip %} Tip: Parameters for samples with high coverage.
>    >
>    > * In samples with a very high coverage, the likelihood of having overlapping alignments increases. Hence the
default `Overlap based` merging may results in very long loci merged by some random alignments.
>    > * Therefore, use the `blockbuster` merging mode and adjust the paramertes accordingly.
>        - From *"Select the mode of merging"*: `Gaussian based (blockbuster)`
>    > * Working with only the chimeric reads further reduces the computation time fr subsequent steps.
>        - *"chimeric_only"*: `Yes`
>    {: .tip}

{: .hands_on}

## Quantify aligned loci to score the alignments

Now we have the loci where the potential interacting read segments are mapped to. Due to the small length of these arms, there is a
very high chance of multi mapping. Another reason for this is the lenient mapping parameters that are used to increase
the mapping sensitivity. Quantification needs 2 files containing read segements and loci where they are mapping to. From
this information, `ChiRA quanitify` tries to infer the correct origin of reads and calculates the expression of the loci
using a simple expectation-maximization algorithm.

>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Tabular file of merged alignments"*: `ChiRA merged alignments` (output of **ChiRA merge** {% icon tool %})
>
{: .hands_on}

## Extract the best scoring chimeras

After having the information about the loci expression, the final step extracts only the best scoring interacting
partners for each read. All the combinations of the transcripts that are overlapping with the interacting loci are
reported. If there is more than one locus with the equal best score then all the best hits are reported. If you have the
genomic fasta file the tool can hybridize the interacting loci sequences using `IntaRNA`.

# Visualization

The output tabular file generated in the above step can be huge with up to some millions of rows depending on the
library size and more than 30 columns. Extracting useful data from this can be very tedious. For example, extracting and
visualizing the distribution of target biotypes of your favorite miRNA can be very tricky and might need more than a
hand full of galaxy tools to achieve. For this reason, there exists a visualization and filtering tool for this data along
with `ChiRA` known as `ChiRAViz`. It is a galaxy visualization framework to work with the output of `ChiRA`. But it does
not directly work with the tabular output we have. Rather it needs a "sqlite" database. For this reason, we first build a
sqlite database from the `ChiRA` output.

the interactions that `mmu-miR-190a` involved in and consider those which have an `IntaRNA` predicted hybrid.

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

Though chimeric reads look normal when inspected in a FASTQ file, the origin of each read is from two different RNA fragments. Limitations of the current sequencing protocols limit the length of each sequenced interacting RNA fragment. These smaller RNA fragments are often harder to map considering that the boundaries of each RNA fragment in the read are unknown. In this tutorial, we have seen how to map these reads and infer the true origins of them by quantifying the mapped loci. The visualization framework gives flexibility in filtering and searching output files, visualize the summaries of filtered data as well as exporting them.
