description: >-
  In this tutorial, we will identify what transcripts are present in the G1E and
  megakaryocyte cellualr states and which transcripts are differentially
  expressed between the two states. We will use a de novo transcript
  reconstruction strategy to infer transcript structures from the mapped reads
  in the absence of the actual annotated transcript structures. This will allow
  us to identify novel transcripts and novel isoforms of known transcripts, as
  well as identify differentially expressed transcripts.

      The data provided here are part of a Galaxy tutorial that analyzes RNA-seq
      data from a study published by Wu et al. in 2014 <a
      href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2014/10/12/gr.164830.113.abstract">DOI:10.1101/gr.164830.113</a>.
      The goal of this study was to investigate “the dynamics of occupancy and
      the role in gene regulation of the transcription factor Tal1, a critical
      regulator of hematopoiesis, at multiple stages of hematopoietic
      differentiation.” To this end, RNA-seq libraries were constructed from
      multiple mouse cell types including G1E - a GATA-null immortalized cell
      line derived from targeted disruption of GATA-1 in mouse embryonic stem
      cells - and megakaryocytes. This RNA-seq data was used to determine
      differential gene expression between G1E and megakaryocytes and later
      correlated with Tal1 occupancy. This dataset (GEO Accession: GSE51338)
      consists of biological replicate, paired-end, poly(A) selected RNA-seq
      libraries. Because of the long processing time for the large original
      files, we have downsampled the original raw data files to include only
      reads that align to chromosome 19 and a subset of interesting genomic loci
      identified by Wu et al.

      Now that we have trimmed our reads and are fortunate that there is a
      reference genome assembly for mouse, we will align our trimmed reads to
      the genome. <br><br>Instead of running a single tool multiple times on all

      To make sense of the reads, their positions within mouse genome must be

      the reference genome.

  - title: Mapping
    content: >-
      In the case of a eukaryotic transcriptome, most reads originate from
      processed mRNAs lacking introns. Therefore, they cannot be simply mapped
      back to the genome as we normally do for reads derived from DNA sequences.
      Instead, the reads must be separated into two categories:
        <ul>
          <li>Reads contained within mature exons - these align perfectly to the reference genome</li>
          <li>Reads that span splice junctions in the mature mRNA - these align with gaps to the reference genome</li>
        </ul>
      Spliced mappers have been developed to efficiently map transcript-derived
      reads against genomes. <a
      href="https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml>HISAT</a> is an
      accurate and fast tool for mapping spliced reads to a genome. Another
      popular spliced aligner is <a

      Now that we have mapped our reads to the mouse genome with <i>HISAT</i>,
      we want to determine transcript structures that are represented by the
      aligned reads. This is called de novo transcriptome reconstruction. This
      unbiased approach permits the comprehensive identification of all
      transcripts present in a sample, including annotated genes, novel isoforms
      of annotated genes, and novel genes. While common gene/transcript
      databases are quite large, they are not comprehensive, and the de novo
      transcriptome reconstruction approach ensures complete transcriptome(s)
      identification from the experimental samples. The leading tool for
      transcript reconstruction is <i>Stringtie</i>. Here, we will use
      <i>Stringtie</i> to predict transcript structures based on the reads
      aligned by <i>HISAT2</i>.

      generated in the absence of a reference transcriptome, and we ultimately
      would like to know what transcript structure corresponds to which
      annotated transcript (if any), we have to make a transcriptome database.
      We will use the tool <i>Stringtie - Merge</i> to combine redundant
      transcript structures across the four samples and the RefSeq reference.
      Once we have merged our transcript structures, we will use
      <i>GFFcompare</i> to annotate the transcripts of our newly created
      transcriptome so we know the relationship of each transcript to the RefSeq

      <br><br>We now want to identify which transcripts are differentially

      In addition to the list of genes, DESeq2 outputs a graphical summary of
      the results, useful to evaluate the quality of the experiment:

      <ul>
        <li>Histogram of <i>p</i>-values for all tests</li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MA_plot>MA plot</a>: global view of the relationship between the expression change of conditions (log ratios, M), the average expression strength of the genes (average mean, A), and the ability of the algorithm to detect differential gene expression. The genes that passed the significance threshold (adjusted p-value < 0.1) are colored in red.</li>
        <li>Principal Component Analysis (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">PCA</a>) and the first two axes</li>
        Each replicate is plotted as an individual data point. This type of plot is useful for visualizing the overall effect of experimental covariates and batch effects.
        <li>Heatmap of sample-to-sample distance matrix: overview over similarities and dissimilarities between samples</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Dispersion estimates: gene-wise estimates (black), the fitted values (red), and the final maximum a posteriori estimates used in testing (blue)</li>
        This dispersion plot is typical, with the final estimates shrunk from the gene-wise estimates towards the fitted estimates. Some gene-wise estimates are flagged as outliers and not shrunk towards the fitted value. The amount of shrinkage can be more or less than seen here, depending on the sample size, the number of coefficients, the row mean and the variability of the gene-wise estimates.

      Now that we have a list of transcript expression levels and their
      differential expression levels, it is time to visually inspect our
      transcript structures and the reads they were predicted from. It is a good
      practice to visually inspect (and present) loci with transcripts of
      interest. Fortunately, there is a built-in genome browser in Galaxy,
      <b>Trackster</b>, that make this task simple (and even fun!).

      <br><br>In this last section, we will convert our aligned read data from
      BAM format to bigWig format to simplify observing where our stranded
      RNA-seq data aligned to. We’ll then initiate a session on Trackster, load
      it with our data, and visually inspect our interesting loci.

      In this tutorial, we have analyzed real RNA sequencing data to extract
      useful information, such as which genes are up- or down-regulated by
      depletion of the Pasilla gene and which genes are regulated by the Pasilla
      gene. To answer these questions, we analyzed RNA sequence datasets using a
      reference-based RNA-seq data analysis approach.
