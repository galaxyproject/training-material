                <p>The data provided here are part of a Galaxy tutorial that analyzes RNA-seq data from a study published by <em>Wu et al.</em> in 2014 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4248312/">DOI:10.1101/gr.164830.113</a>. The goal of this study was to investigate “the dynamics of occupancy and the role in gene regulation of the transcription factor Tal1, a critical regulator of hematopoiesis, at multiple stages of hematopoietic differentiation.” To this end, RNA-seq libraries were constructed from multiple mouse cell types including G1E - a GATA-null immortalized cell line derived from targeted disruption of GATA-1 in mouse embryonic stem cells - and megakaryocytes. This RNA-seq data was used to determine differential gene expression between G1E and megakaryocytes and later correlated with Tal1 occupancy. This dataset (GEO Accession: GSE51338) consists of biological replicate, paired-end, poly(A) selected RNA-seq libraries. Because of the long processing time for the large original files, we have downsampled the original raw data files to include only reads that align to chromosome 19 and a subset of interesting genomic loci identified by Wu <em>et al</em>.</p>

<h1 id="analysis-strategy">Analysis strategy</h1>

<p>The goal of this exercise is to identify what transcripts are present in the G1E and megakaryocyte cellular states and which transcripts are differentially expressed between the two states. We will use a <em>de novo</em> transcript reconstruction strategy to infer transcript structures from the mapped reads in the absence of the actual annotated transcript structures. This will allow us to identify novel transcripts and novel isoforms of known transcripts, as well as identify differentially expressed transcripts.</p>

<h2 id="data-upload">Data upload</h2>

<p>Due to the large size of this dataset, we have downsampled it to only include reads mapping to chromosome 19 and certain loci with relevance to hematopoeisis. This data is available at <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/583140"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Zenodo</code></a>, where you can find the forward and reverse reads corresponding to replicate RNA-seq libraries from G1E and megakaryocyte cells and an annotation file of RefSeq transcripts we will use to generate our transcriptome database.</p>

<p>In the case of a eukaryotic transcriptome, most reads originate from processed mRNAs lacking introns. Therefore, they cannot be simply mapped back to the genome as we normally do for reads derived from DNA sequences. Instead, the reads must be separated into two categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reads contained within mature exons - these align perfectly to the reference genome</li>
  <li>Reads that span splice junctions in the mature mRNA - these align with gaps to the reference genome</li>
</ul>

<p>Spliced mappers have been developed to efficiently map transcript-derived reads against genomes. <a href="https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HISAT</code></a> is an accurate and fast tool for mapping spliced reads to a genome.

<h1 id="de-novo-transcript-reconstruction">De novo transcript reconstruction</h1>
<p>Now that we have mapped our reads to the mouse genome with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HISAT</code>, we want to determine transcript structures that are represented by the aligned reads. This is called <em>de novo</em> transcriptome reconstruction. This unbiased approach permits the comprehensive identification of all transcripts present in a sample, including annotated genes, novel isoforms of annotated genes, and novel genes. While common gene/transcript databases are quite large, they are not comprehensive, and the <em>de novo</em> transcriptome reconstruction approach ensures complete transcriptome(s) identification from the experimental samples. The leading tool for transcript reconstruction is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Stringtie</code>. Here, we will use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Stringtie</code> to predict transcript structures based on the reads aligned by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HISAT</code>.</p>

<p>We just generated four transcriptomes with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Stringtie</code> representing each of the four RNA-seq libraries we are analyzing. Since these were generated in the absence of a reference transcriptome, and we ultimately would like to know what transcript structure corresponds to which annotated transcript (if any), we have to make a <strong>transcriptome database</strong>. We will use the tool <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Stringtie - Merge</code> to combine redundant transcript structures across the four samples and the RefSeq reference.

<h1 id="analysis-of-the-differential-gene-expression">Analysis of the differential gene expression</h1>

<p>We just generated a transriptome database that represents the transcripts present in the G1E and megakaryocytes samples. This database provides the location of our transcripts with non-redundant identifiers, as well as information regarding the origin of the transcript.</p>

<p>We now want to identify which transcripts are differentially expressed between the G1E and megakaryocyte cellular states. To do this we will implement a counting approach using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FeatureCounts</code> to count reads per transcript. Then we will provide this information to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DESeq2</code> to generate normalized transcript counts (abundance estimates) and significance testing for differential expression.</p>

<h1 id="visualization">Visualization</h1>
<p>Now that we have a list of transcript expression levels and their differential expression levels, it is time to visually inspect our transcript structures and the reads they were predicted from. It is a good practice to visually inspect (and present) loci with transcripts of interest. Fortunately, there is a built-in genome browser in Galaxy, <strong>Trackster</strong>, that make this task simple (and even fun!).</p>

<p>In this last section, we will convert our aligned read data from BAM format to bigWig format to simplify observing where our stranded RNA-seq data aligned to. We’ll then initiate a session on Trackster, load it with our data, and visually inspect our interesting loci.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In this tutorial, we have analyzed RNA sequencing data to extract useful information, such as which genes are expressed in the G1E and megakaryocyte cellular states and which of these genes are differentially expressed between the two cellular states. In addition, we identified unannotated genes that are expressed in a cell-state dependent manner and at a locus with relevance to differentiation and development. To identify these transcripts, we analyzed RNA sequence datasets using a de novo transcriptome reconstruction RNA-seq data analysis approach. This approach can be summed up with the following scheme:</p>
