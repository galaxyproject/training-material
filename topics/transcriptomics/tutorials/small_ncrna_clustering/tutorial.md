# Introduction

Small Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play a vital role in many cellular processes such as RNA splicing, translation, gene regulation. The small RNA-seq is a type of RNA-seq in which RNA fragments are size selected to capture only short RNAs. One of the most common applications of the small RNA-seq is discovering novel small ncRNAs. Mapping the small RNA-seq data reveals interesting patterns that represent the traces of the small RNA processing.

For example, consider the miRNA biogenesis. The primary miRNA transcripts are processed by Drosha-complexes and results in hairpin precursor miRNAs. Then after they transported to the cytoplasm, Dicer slices off the hairpin. One of the RNA strands bound by Argonaute proteins regulates the target mRNA while the other strand is degraded.

The following figure (bottom part of the figure is taken from {% cite Pasquinelli2012 %}) represents one of the small RNA processing patterns. The vertical block bars represent a mapped reads on reference genome. The height of the bars represents the number of reads mapped at that location. Reads in each bubble represent a *read profile*. In this case, they both are from miRNAs. From the small RNA-seq, we often see the two processed miRNA strands after mapping. The miRNA strand which targets the mRNA is expressed and we see more reads compared to the degraded strand. The gap between those two piles of reads represents the missing hairpin.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use **BlockClust** to cluster similar processing patterns together.

# Preprocessing of the data
The data is we use is from human cell line MCF-7 sequenced in single-end on Illumina Genome Analyzer II. Reads are 36nt long and should be sufficiently long enough for this type of data. We start with a BAM file as an input for this tutorial. This BAM file is a result of mapping the reads on human reference genome build hg19 using **segemehl**. If you want to use your own raw sequencing data, please clip the adapters and map to the reference genome.

In the first step, we convert the BAM file into BED file. This is not a plain file conversion. Hence we cannot use any kind of BAM to BED conversion tools. We use BlockClust tool in the pre-processing mode for this purpose. The resulting BED file contains tags (a tag is a unique read sequence in a deep-sequencing library) and their normalized expression (in column 5), i.e. the ratio of the read count per tag to the number of mappings on the reference genome.

## Sort BAM file
Before continue to BAM to BED conversion we need to sort the alignments in the input BAM file by their positions.

# Grouping of the adjacent reads into read profiles

Now we group the adjacent reads into so-called blocks and blockgroups using blockbuster tool. In general, each blockgroup should represent a single ncRNA read profile.

![blocks of a blockgroup](../../images/transcriptomics_images/blockclust_blocks.png "Representation of blocks and blockgroups of a read profile")

> <details-title>More details about the theory</details-title>
>
> The idea is to perform peak detection on the signal obtained by counting the number of reads per nucleotide. This signal, spanning adjacent loci, is then modeled with a mixture of Gaussians. An iterative greedy procedure is then used to collect reads that belong to the same block, starting from the largest Gaussian component, and removing them in successive iterations. The tool further assembles a sequence of adjacent blocks into a blockgroup if the blocks are either overlapping or are at a distance smaller than a user-defined threshold. A more detailed explanation is at [the blockbuster website](http://hoffmann.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/LIFE/blockbuster.html)

## Sort the BED file of tags

In order to run the blockbuster successfully the input BED file need to be sorted by chromosome, strand, start position and then end positions.

# Clustering with **BlockClust**
Here we use **BlockClust** in clustering mode. All you need here is the output of the **blockbuster**.

Apart from clustering, **BlockClust** has built-in class specific discriminative models for C/D box snoRNA, H/ACA box snoRNA, miRNA, rRNA, snRNA, tRNA and Y_RNA. So it can also be used to predict if a read profile might belong to one of the known ncRNA class.

>        - *"Would you like to perform classification?"*: `Yes`
>        - *"Mode of classification"*: `Model based`
>
{: .hands_on}

The tool produces the following four output files.

The `BlockClust: BED of predicted clusters` file is the result of Markov cluster algorithm. Each entry in this file represents a blockgroup. The 4th column contains is in the form of *annotation:blockgroup_id:cluster_id*. The *cluster_id* represents which cluster the blockgroup belongs to.

The `BlockClust: Model based predictions BED` file is the result of classification. Each entry in this file represents a blockgroup. The 4th column contains the annotation of the ncRNA which it overlaps. For the blockgroups which are not overlapped with any known ncRNAs, the prefix `predicted_` is added indicating that it is predicted by the **BlockClust** classification models.

The `BlockClust: Hierarchical clustering plot` file shows a dendrogram construced based on average linkage clustering.

The `BlockClust: Pairwise similarities` file contains the pairwise similarities of all input blockgroups.

Next, we will visualize the read profiles (from the BAM file) and the predictions (BED from **BlockClust**) together.
