# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

Single-cell RNA-seq analysis is a rapidly evolving field at the forefront of transcriptomic research, used in high-throughput developmental studies and rare transcript studies to examine cell heterogeneity within a populations of cells.
The cellular resolution and genome wide scope make it possible to draw new conclusions that are not otherwise possible with bulk RNA-seq. The analysis requires a great deal of knowledge about statistics, wet-lab protocols, and some machine learning due to variability and sparseness of the data. The uncertainty from the low coverage and low cell numbers per sample that once were common setbacks in the field are overcome by 10x Genomics which provides high-throughput solutions which are quickly championing the field.

### Era of 10x Genomics

10x genomics has provided not only a cost-effective high-throughput solution to understanding sample heterogeneity at the individual cell level, but has defined the standards of the field that many downstream analysis packages are now scrambling to accommodate.

![clusters]({% link topics/transcriptomics/images/tenx_clusters_intro.png %} "From less than 1K to over 10K with 10x genomics: Analyses of two separate scRNA datasets using the (left) CelSEQ2 protocol, and the (right) 10x Chromium system.")

The gain in resolution reduces the granularity and noise issues that plagued the field of scRNA-seq not long ago, where now individual clusters are much easier to decipher due to the added stability added by this gain in information.

### Library Preparation

![Library Preparation]({% link topics/transcriptomics/images/tenx_libprep.png %} "An overview of the library preparation")

The 10X barcoded gel beads consist of a pool barcodes which are used to separately index each cell's transcriptome. The individual gel barcodes are delivered to each cell via flow-cytometry, where each cell is fed single-file along a liquid tube and tagged with a 10X gel bead. The cells are then isolated from one another within thousands of nanoliter droplets, where each droplet described by a unique 10x barcode that all reads in that droplet are associated with once they undergo reverse-transcription (RT) which reconstructs the mRNA into a cDNA counterpart. The oil is then removed and all (now barcoded) cDNA reads are pooled together to be sequenced.

Though there are approximately 3 million 10x gel barcodes used, the amount actually qualitatively profiled in a sample is ~10,000 due to majority of droplets (>90%) being empty in order to ensure that the remainder contains only one cell.

> ### {% icon details %} Whitelist Barcodes

>

![Overview of workflow]({% link topics/transcriptomics/images/tenx_workflow.png %} "An overview of the workflow")

The first part of this tutorial is essentially a one-click "fire and forget" solution to demultiplexing and quantifying scRNA-seq data, where much of the complexity required in this extremely crucial stage is simplified into a single step.

However, those who are more interested in learning the intricacies of how FASTQ files are transformed into a count matrix, please see the [Pre-processing of Single-Cell RNA Data]({% link topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-preprocessing/tutorial.md %}) tutorial.

10x Genomics has its own processing pipeline, [Cell Ranger](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger) to process the scRNA-seq outputs it produces, but this process requires much configuration to run and is significantly slower than other mappers.

Since STARsolo is a drop-in solution to the *Cell Ranger* pipeline, the first part of the tutorial is a one-click solution where users are encouraged to launch their **RNA STARsolo** jobs and spend the time familiarising themselves with the pre-processing training materials mentioned above.

{: .details}

The second part of this tutorial also has a one-click solution to producing a matrix identical to that given by the *Cell Ranger* pipeline, but the more interesting aspects of the pipeline are explored in the *Introspective Method* part of the tutorial.


# Producing a Count Matrix from FASTQ

Here we will use the [1k PBMCs from a Healthy Donor (v3 chemistry)](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/3.0.0/pbmc_1k_v3) from 10x genomics, consisting of 1000 Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) extracted from a healthy donor, where PBMCs are primary cells with relatively small amounts of RNA (~1pg RNA/cell).

The source material consists of 6 FASTQ files split into two sequencing lanes *L001* and *L002*, each with three reads of **R1** (barcodes), **R2** (cDNA sequences), **I1** (illumina lane info):
  * pbmc\_1k\_v3\_S1\_*L001*\_**R1**\_001.fastq.gz
  * pbmc\_1k\_v3\_S1\_*L001*\_**R2**\_001.fastq.gz
  * pbmc\_1k\_v3\_S1\_*L001*\_**I1**\_001.fastq.gz
  * pbmc\_1k\_v3\_S1\_*L002*\_**R1**\_001.fastq.gz
  * pbmc\_1k\_v3\_S1\_*L002*\_**R2**\_001.fastq.gz
  * pbmc\_1k\_v3\_S1\_*L002*\_**I1**\_001.fastq.gz

The *Cell Ranger* pipeline requires all three files to perform the demultiplexing and quantification, but **RNA STARsolo** does [not require](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/issues/640) the I1 lane file to perform the analysis. These source files are provided in the [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3457880) data repository, but they require approximately 2 hours to process. For this tutorial, we will use datasets sub-sampled from the source files to contain approximately 300 cells instead of 1000. Details of this sub-sampling process can be viewed at the [Zenodo link](https://zenodo.org/record/3457880/files/subsetting_data.txt).

### Data upload and organization

For the mapping, we require the sub-sampled source files, as well as a "whitelist" of (~3,7 million) known cell barcodes, [freely extracted](https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004506263-What-is-a-barcode-whitelist) from the *Cell Ranger* pipeline. This whitelist file may be found within the Galaxy Data Library, but it is included here in the Zenodo record for convenience and also because the sequencing facility may not always provide this file.

The barcodes in the R1 FASTQ data are checked against these known cell barcodes in order assign a specific read to a specific known cell. The barcodes are designed in such a manner that there is virtually no chance that they will align to a place in the reference genome. In this tutorial we will be using hg19 (GRCh37) version of the human genome, and will therefore also need to use a hg19 GTF file to annotate our reads.

## 10x Chemistries

There are two main reagent kits used during the library preparation, and the choice of one will influence the size of the sequences we work with. Below we can see the layout of the primers used in both chemistries. We can ignore most of these as they are not relevant, namely: the P5 and P7 illumina primers are used in the illumina [bridge amplification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumina_dye_sequencing#Bridge_amplification) process; the Sample Index is an 8bp primer which is related to the Chromium system that balances nucleotide bias and ensures that there is no sample overlap during the multiplexed sequencing; and the Poly(dT) VN primer used to capture RNA sequences with poly-A tails (i.e. mRNA).

![chem]({% link topics/transcriptomics/images/tenx_primers.svg %} "10x Chromiumv2 and Chromiumv3 Chemistries")

The primers of interest to us are the Cell Barcode (CB) and the Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMI) used in the Read 1 sequencing primer, as they describe to us how to demultiplex and deduplicate our reads. It is highly advised that the [Plates, Batches, and Barcodes]({% link topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-preprocessing/tutorial.md %}) slides are revisited to refresh your mind on these concepts.


| Chemistry | Read 2 | Read 1 (CB + UMI) | Insert (Read 2 + Read 1) |
|:---------:|:------:|:-----------------:|:------------------------:|
| v2        |  98    | 26 (16 + 10)      | 124 |
| v3        |  91    | 28 (16 + 12)      | 119 |

The table above gives a summary of the primers used in the image and the number of basepairs occupied by each.

> ### {% icon details %} Details: Strandedness
>
> Unstranded protocols do not distinguish between whether a fragment was sequenced from the forward or the reverse strand, which can lead to some ambiguity if the fragment overlaps two transcripts. In the image below, it is not clear whether the fragment is derived from GeneF or GeneR due to this overlap.
>
> ![strandedness]({% link topics/transcriptomics/images/tenx_strandedness.svg %} "Mapping fragments to overlapping transcripts is ambiguous with unstranded protocols.")
>
> Stranded protocols overcome this by fitting different 5' and 3' primers and adaptors, meaning that the orientation of the fragment is fixed during sequencing. For the Chromium v2 and v3 chemistries, the barcode information is purely within the R1 forward strand.

UMIs (or Unique Molecular identifiers) do not delineate cells as Cell Barcodes do, but instead serve as random 'salt' that tag molecules randomly and are used to mitigate amplification bias by deduplicating any two reads that map to the same position with the same UMI, where the chance of this happening will be astronomically small unless one read is a direct amplicon of the other.
> > 1. $$4^{10} = 1,048,576$$ unique molecules tagged, vs. $$4^{12} = 16,777,216$$ unique molecules tagged. The reality is much much smaller due to edit distances being used that would reduce both these numbers substantially (as seen in the [*Plates, Batches, and Barcodes*]({% link topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-plates-batches-barcodes/slides.html %}) slides), but the scale factor of 16 times more molecules ($$4^{12-10} = 16$$) can be uniquely tagged is true.
> > 1. Forward.
> {: .solution}
{: .question}

The differences in the chemistries is a slight change in the library size, where the v2 aims to capture *on average* 50,000 reads per cell, whereas the v3 aims to capture *at minimum* 20,000 reads per cell. This greatly reduces the lower-tail of the library size compared to the previous version.


### Determining what Chemistry our Data Contains

To perform the demultiplexing, we need to tell **RNA STARsolo** where to look in the R1 FASTQ to find the cell barcodes. We can do this by simply counting the number of basepairs in any read of the R1 files.

## Performing the Demultiplexing and Quantification

We will now proceed to demultiplex, map, and quantify both sets of reads using the correct chemistry discovered in the previous sub-section.

## Inspecting the Output Files

At this stage **RNA STARsolo** has output 5 files, 2 mapping quality files and 3 matrix files:
 1. Log
 1. Feature Statistic Summaries
 1. Matrix Gene Counts
 1. Barcodes
 1. Genes


### Mapping Quality

Let us investigate the output log. This type of quality control is essential in any RNA-based analysis and it is strongly recommended that you familiarise yourself with the [Quality Control]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.md %}) tutorial.

The explanation of these parameters can be seen in the [RNA STAR Manual](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/doc/STARmanual.pdf) under the *STARsolo* section, with most of the information given in the details box below.

>  | nTooMany | not used at the moment |
>  | nNoMatch | number of reads with CBs that do not match whitelist even with one mismatch |

The main information to gather at this stage is that the `nCellBarcodes` tell us how many cells were detected in our sample, where we see that there are 5200 cells, which is expected of our sub-sampled data. Another metric to take into account is that the number of matches (`nMatch`) has the largest value, and that the number of reads that map to the genome but not to a feature/gene given in the GTF (`nNoFeature`) is not too large. The number of no features is also quite high when mapping the original (non-subsampled) 10x input datasets, so this appears to be the default expected behaviour.



# Producing a Quality Count Matrix

The matrix files produced by **RNA STARsolo** are in the *bundled* format, meaning that the information to create a tabular matrix of Genes vs Cells are separated into different files. These files are already 10x analysis datasets, compatible with any downstream single-cell RNA analysis pipeline, however the number of cells represented here are greatly over-represented, as they have not yet been filtered for high quality cells, and therefore the matrix represents *any* cells that were unambiguously detected in the sample.

If we were to construct a cell matrix using the data we have, we would have a large matrix of 60,000 Genes against 3 million Cells, of which most values would be zero, i.e. an *extremely* sparse matrix.

To get a high quality count matrix we must apply the **DropletUtils** tool, which will produce a filtered dataset that is more representative of the *Cell Ranger* pipeline.

Later on, we will actually later visualise these thresholds ourselves by "ranking" the barcodes, to see the dividing line between high and low quality barcodes.

This will produce a count matrix in a human readable tabular format which can be used in downstream analysis tools, such as those used in the [*Downstream Single-cell RNA analysis with RaceID*]({% link topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-raceid/tutorial.md %}) tutorial.

This is the default output of *Cell Ranger* and so is also the default output of **RNA STARsolo**. The format is also now a widely accepted format in many downstream analysis suites.

## Introspective Method

The *DefaultDrops* method given in the previous sub-section is a good one-click solution to emulating the *Cell Ranger* process of producing a high quality count matrix.

However, the **DropletUtils** tool does provide other options for determining which cells are of "good" quality and which are not.

A useful diagnostic for droplet-based data is the barcode rank plot, which shows the (log-)total UMI count for each barcode on the y-axis and the (log-)rank on the x-axis. This is effectively a transposed empirical cumulative density plot with log-transformed axes. It is useful as it allows users to examine the distribution of total counts across barcodes, focusing on those with the largest counts.

![knee]({% link topics/transcriptomics/images/tenx_knee.png %} "Barcode Ranks: The separating thresholds of high and low quality cells")

The knee and inflection points on the curve mark the transition between two components of the total count distribution. This is assumed to represent the difference between empty droplets with little RNA and cell-containing droplets with much more RNA, and gives us a rough idea of how many cells to expect in our sample.

On large 10x datasets we can use these thresholds as metrics to utilise in our own custom filtering, which is once again provided by the **DropletUtils** tool.

Here we recover 282 high quality cells instead of the 272 detected via the default method previously. On large datasets, this difference can help clean downstream clustering. For example, soft or less well-defined clusters are derived from too much noise in the data due to too many low quality cells being in the data during the clustering. Filtering these out during the pre-processing would produce much better separation, albeit at the cost of having less cells to cluster. This filter-cluster trade-off is discussed in more detail in the downstream analysis training materials.


# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

In this workflow we have learned to quickly perform mapping and quantification of scRNA-seq FASTQ data in a single step via **RNA STARsolo**, and have reproduced a *Cell Ranger* workflow using the **DropletUtils** suite, where we further explored the use of barcode rankings to determine better filtering thresholds to generate a high quality count matrix.

A full pipeline which produces both an AnnData and tabular file for inspection is provided [here](workflows/scrna_tenx.ga).
