<!-- Questions for team

* Does it make sense to split out the Understanding Barcodes section into its own tutorial
* Does it make sense to split out the Understanding Plates and Batches into its own tutorial
* How do I set 'requirements'?
* All other tutorials have only 1 set of slides to accompany the material.
   - Here I will need seperate ones for: UMIs, CelSeq

Todo:
* Split "Mitigating duplicate transcript counts with UMIs"
* Snippets can be parameterised, so USE them more.

Feedback:
* BG says the concepts of Cell barcode, UMI, and overall barcode are confusing.

## Why do Single Cell sequencing?
{:.no_toc}

Single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing is the technological successor to classical bulk RNA-seq, where samples are no longer defined at the tissue level but at the individual cell level. Under bulk RNA-seq the expression of genes in a sample would yield the average expression of all the constituent cells in that sample, irregardless of the distinct expressions profiles given by subpopulations of cells. The advent of scRNA sequencing has provided the means to explore samples at the individual cell level, enabling a greater understanding of the development and function of such samples by the characteristics of their constituent cells. Consider the heterogenity of cells sampled from bone marrow, where hematopoietic stem cells can give rise to many different cell types within the same tissue:

 ![Cell Differentiation of Hematopoietic Stem cells](../../images/scrna_hematopoiesis.png "Cell Differentiation of Hematopoietic Stem cells [Wikimedia Commons]")
 
The genes expressed by these cells at different developmental time points can be subtle, but generally can be classified into discrete cell subpopulations or under statistical clustering methods such as PCA or tSNE. Cells in the same cluster exhibit similar profiles of differential expression in the same set of related genes, compared to cells in other clusters. By identifying significant genes in each cluster, cell types and cell developmental heirarchies can be inferred based on the proximity of these clusters to one another.

Other than cell development, there are many more factors that can shape the level of gene expression exhibited by a given cell. Intercellular cell-signalling can block or enhance specific transcripts, the total amount of transcripts of a cell increases with the cell-cycle, or the proximity of a cell within a tissue to nutrients or oxygen.

 ![Facets of Cellular Identity](../../images/scrna_nbt3711.png "Revealing the vectors of cellular identity with single-cell genomics, Nature Biotechnology, 2016")


This tutorial is in part inspired by aspects of the [Hemberg workflow](https://hemberg-lab.github.io/scRNA.seq.course/) at the Sanger institute, as well as the [CGATOxford workflow](https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools) which provides the **UMI-tools** suite that we make use of. The barcoding follows the [CelSeq2 protocol](#details-the-celseq2-protocol) and uses the lane configuration as that utilized by the Freiburg MPI GrÃ¼n lab.

# Analysis Strategy
{:.no_toc}

Most scRNA sequencing techniques use pooled-sequencing approaches to generate a higher throughput of data by performing amplification and sequencing upon multiple cells in the same "pool". From a bioinformatics standpoint, this means that the output FASTQ data from the sequencer is batch-specific and contains all the sequences from multiple cells.

In this tutorial, we will perform pre-processing upon scRNA FASTQ batch data to generate an *N*-by-*M*  count matrix of *N* cells and *M* genes, with each element indicating the level of expression of that gene in a particular cell.

This count matrix is crucial for performing the downstream analysis, where differential gene analysis is performed between cells in order to cluster them into groups denoting their cell type and lineage. 

The tutorial is structured in two parts:

 ![Overview of workflow](../../images/scrna_workflow.svg "An overview of the entire workflow")

The first part of this tutorial will use example *FASTQ* data from a single batch, which we will perform [barcode extraction](#understanding-barcodes) and annotation upon. Alignment and quality control will also be performed, and we will see how to construct a rudimentary count matrix. 


The second part of this tutorial will deal with [multiple batches](#multiple-batches), and a different set of example count matrices will be used in which to merge and perform quality control upon. This will produce a final count matrix valid for downstream analysis.

# Single Batch Processing

### Data upload and organization

In this tutorial we will be analysing scRNA-seq data of bone marrow cells taken from a single C57 mouse by *Herman et al.* ([2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4662)) and producing a count matrix that we can use for later analysis.

The size of scRNA files (.fastq) are typically in the gigabyte range and are somewhat impractical for training purposes, so we will expediate the analysis by using a smaller subset of actual batch data. We will also be using *Mus Musculus* annotation data (.gtf) from the  [NCBI RefSeq](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/vertebrate_mammalian/Mus_musculus/) track, as well as a barcodes file (.tsv).

## Understanding Barcodes

[Back to previous](javascript:window.history.back())

Barcodes are small random oligonucleotides that are inserted into the captured sequence at a specific point, and provide two pieces of information about the sequence:
  
 1. Which cell the sequence came from
 2. Which transcript the sequence came from

When the sequence is mapped against a reference genome, we can then see which gene locus it aligns to and qualitavely assert that, together with the two pieces of information above, the sequence depicts a transcript from a specific a gene that originated from a specific cell.

> ### {% icon question %} Questions about Cell Barcodes
>
> 1. Why is it important to know which cell a sequence came from?
> 2. Barcoding the cell makes sense, but why do we need to barcode the transcript too? i.e. Can we not infer which gene the sequence originates from by simply mapping it against the reference genome?
> 
> > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
> >
> > 1. If our sequence codes for a *GeneX* which is a gene of interest, we may want to know which cells express GeneX more than others.   
> > e.g. If *CellA* has 10 times more *GeneX* sequences than *CellB*, then we know that *CellA* and *CellB* differ at *GeneX* - which might suggest a causative source of variation for any change in function between *CellA* and *CellB* (or cells in the same cluster as *CellA*, and cells in the same cluster as *CellB*).
> > 2. *Yes* and *no*!  
> > **Yes**: We can indeed align our sequence against a reference genome and obtain the name of the gene it aligns against. This sequence will then contribute to the 'count' of sequences that gene has, and increase the expression of that gene.  
> > **No**: We do not know whether these 'counts' are *unique*. Many of these counts could be duplicates as a result of the amplification process. To explain further, we must look at UMIs and their role in the analysis.
> {: .solution}
{: .question}

To explore the uniqueness of counts, we must discuss the inclusion of *UMIs* in a single-cell analysis.

> ### {% icon details %} Mitigating duplicate transcript counts with UMIs
>
> One of the major issues with sequencing is that the read fragments require amplification before they can be sequenced. A gene with a single mRNA transcript will not be detected by most sequencers, so it needs to be duplicated 100-1000x times for the sequencer to 'see' it.
>
>
> Amplification is an imprecise process however, since some reads are amplified more than others, and subsequent amplification can lead to these over-amplified reads being over-amplified even more, leading to an exponential bias of some reads over others.
>
> 
> ![Amplification Bias](../../images/scrna_amplif_errors.png "A cell with two reads from different trascripts being amplified unevenly")
>
> Consider the above example where two reads from different transcripts are amplified unevenly. The resulting frequency table would look like so:
>
>  |  | Reads in Cell 1 |
>  |--|------------------|
>  | Gene Red | 5 |
>  | Gene Blue | 0 |
>
> 
> But the truth is entirely different (i.e. Gene Red should have 1 count, and Gene Blue should also have 1 count). How do we correct for this bias?
>
> 
> **Unique Molecular Identifiers** (or *UMIs*) constitute the second portion of a barcode, where their role is to *uniquely* count reads such that amplicons of the same read are only counted once, e.g:
> 
>  ![Amplification Bias with UMIs](../../images/scrna_amplif_errors_umis.png "A cell with four unique transcripts, two from Gene Red and two from Gene Blue")
> 
> Here, we see two unique transcripts from Gene Red and two unique transcripts from Gene Blue, each given a (coloured) UMI. After amplificaiton, Gene Red has more reads than Gene Blue. If we were to construct a frequency table as before to count the reads, we would have:
> 
>  |  | Reads in Cell 1 |
>  |--|-----------------|
>  | Gene Red | 6 |
>  | Gene Blue | 3 |
>  
>  Which is wrong, because it shows that Red has twice the expression that Blue does. However, we can reconstitute the true count by considering the UMI information:
>  
>  |  | UMI colour  | Reads in Cell 1 |
>  |--|-------------|-----------------|
>  | Gene Red | Pink | 2 |
>  |          | Blue | 4 |
>  | Gene Blue | Brown | 1 |
>  |           | Green | 2 |
>  
> We can then make the decision to ignore the frequencies of these UMIs, and simply count how many *unique* UMIs we see in each gene:
> 
>  |  | Set of UMIs in Gene | UMIs in Cell 1 |
>  |--|---------------------|----------------|
>  | Gene Red | {Pink, Blue} | 2 |
>  | Gene Blue | {Brown, Green} | 2 |
>  
>  Which provides us with the true count of the number of true transcripts for each gene:
>  
>  |  | UMIs in Cell 1 |
>  |--|----------------|
>  | Gene Red | 2 |
>  | Gene Blue | 2 |
>

{: .details}

> ### {% icon question %} Questions about UMIs
>
> 1. Are UMIs specific to genes? i.e. Can the same UMI map to different genes?
> 2. Can the same UMI map to different mRNA molecules of the same gene?
> 
> > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
> >
> 1. No. The same UMI can tag transcripts of different genes. UMIs are not universal tags, they are just 'added randomness' that help reduce amplification bias -- not unique to any particular gene.
> > 2. Yes, UMIs are not precise but operate probabilistically. In most cases, two transcripts of the same gene will be tagged by different UMIs. In rarer (but still prevalent) cases, the same UMI will capture different transcripts of the same gene.

### Barcoding Format

We now know the role of UMIs and cell barcodes, but how do we handle them in the analysis? Let us look at 4 example sequences in our paired-end FASTQ data.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Preparing the Data

>    1. Create a new history and rename it (*e.g.* 'Inspecting FastQ Files in scRNA batch data')

{: .hands_on}

At this point we now have a history with two items: our paired FASTQ test data, and a tabular file of read names. We will now apply the tabular file to the FASTQ file and extract only those reads.

What we observe are the standard four lines of any FASTQ file:
  1. Read name starting with `@`
  2. Sequence of nucleotide bases
  3. Seperator `+`
  4. Quality string of the nucleotide bases in ASCII

The main source of interest for us is in the (2) sequences of these reads, which somewhere within encode for three crucial pieces of information that we will need to perform quantification:

  1. Cell Barcode
  2. UMI Barcode
  3. Reverse-transcribed mRNA sequence

These can be encoded into the sequences of our paired-end data by any means. In order to know where our barcodes are, we must be familiar with the sequencing primers used in the analysis:

> ### {% icon details %} The CelSeq2 protocol
> 
> CelSeq2 is a paired-end protocol, meaning that two primers bind to opposite strands in order to sequence. Each primer has a specific role. In this case; *Read1* contains the barcoding information followed by the polyT tail of the messenger RNA, and *Read2* contains the actual sequence. Here, Read1 is regarded as the 'forward' strand and Read2 as the 'reverse' strand, though this is more a convention when dealing with paired-end data rather than an indication of the actual strand orientation.

> ![CelSeq2 Scheme](../../images/celseq2_schema.png "Read1 encapsulates the barcodes, and Read2 the mRNA sequence")
>
> [Back to previous](javascript:window.history.back())
{: .details}

#### Verifying the Barcode Format

As shown in [CelSeq2 Primer Figure](#details-the-celseq2-protocol), we have the following encoding:
 * Forward Read:
    * 01-06bp: UMI Barcode
    * 07-12bp: Cell Barcode
    * 13-30bp: Poly-T tail
 * Reverse Read:
    * 01-70bp: mRNA sequence

The encoding of the barcodes on the first read can actually be seen by examining the distribution of bases in a FastQC plot.

Here we can see the three distinct regions along the x-axis that correspond to our expected CelSeq2 Schema:

 * 01 - 06 bp: smooth, relatively constant bases.
 * 07 - 12 bp: noisy, highly varied distribution of bases.
 * 13 - 30b p: T-dominated region

We can see that the distribution of the first 6bp is relatively more even than the following 6bp which seems to have more extreme variation.

UMIs are not so well-curated -- i.e it is possible to encounter the same UMI in the same cell multiple times. The more extreme variation in the 7-12bp region is simply caused by a fewer number of samples.

### Uniting Barcodes with Sequence

In a sense, we have a disparity in our data: the reverse reads contain the sequences we wish to map, but not the barcodes; the forward reads contain the barcode, but not the sequence. For the forward and reverse reads given above, the information that we really want from both can be summarized in this table:

#### Coupling our Data Sources

How should we unite these two source of information into a single location without impacting the data content?

For this we need to take the barcode information from the Forward reads, and stick it into the *header* of the Reverse reads. That way we can align our sequence to the reference and still keep the barcode information associated with the reads.

## Mapping / Alignment

In their raw state, FASTQ files do not tell us very much. The sequences they signify align to genes in a genome, and it is these genes that we are interested in.

Mapping is a relatively straightforward process, and is covered more extensively in the [Galaxy NGS tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/sequence-analysis):

 1. Select your genome
 2. Select your gene annotation file
 3. Run the alignment program
 3. Run MultiQC on the resulting log

The FASTQ data was sequenced from mouse data, so to perform the alignment we will need to gather all data relevant to that genome. We will use the latest version (mm10).

The annotation GTF file must match the genome version used, since both use physical coordinates. Each GTF contains all the gene, exon, intron, and other regions of interest that we will use to annotate our reads, should our reads align to any of the regions specified in this file.

For alignment, we will use RNA-STAR for performance and splice-awareness.

The purpose of MultiQC is to observe how well our reads were mapped against the reference genome. Many reads are discarded due to being of too low quality, or having ambiguous sequence content that can map them to multiple locations.

#### Confirming Reads in the BAM file

We now have a BAM file of our aligned reads, with cell and UMI barcodes embedded in the read headers. We also have the chromosome and base-pair positions of where these reads are aligned. The can be confirmed by peeking into the BAM file:

The fields of the BAM file can be better explained at section 1.4 of [the SAM specification](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf), but we will summarize the main fields of interest here:

 * `J00182..._GACGAA_GCGGTC`: The *readname* appended by `_`, the cell barcode, another `_`, and then the UMI barcode.
 * `16`: The FLAG value

{: .question}

 * `chr1` `2030`: The position and base-pair of alignment of the first base of the sequence.
 * A series of quality fields, with the main contributors being  the sequence and sequence quality strings.
 * `NH`: The number of hits for  this read. If it is multiply mapped, then the number of multiples will be shown (here `2`).
 * `HI`: Which number this particular read is in the series of (potentially) multi-mapped reads (here `1`, not neccesarily meaning the first or 'better').
 * `nM`: The number of mismatches in the alignment of this read to the reference (here `2`).


#### Filtering the BAM File

If we perform counting on the current BAM file we will be counting all reads, even the undesireable ones such as those that did not align so optimally.

The main filtering steps performed on our reads so far have been relatively silent due to the 'default' parameters used.
 * *UMI-tools Extract* - Filters reads for those only with matching barcodes given by our barcodes file.
 * *RNA-STAR* - As seen in the log, we lose 10% of our reads for being too short or being multiply mapped.

Another filtering measure we can apply is to keep reads that we are confident about, e.g those with a minimum number of mismatches to the reference within an acceptable range.

## Quantification 

Once we have the name of the gene for a specific read, we can tally how many of those reads fall into that gene and generate a count matrix.

Tallying reads is performed by two commonly-used tools:
 1. RNA-STAR
 2. FeatureCounts

**RNA-STAR** indeed has the recent ability to count reads as it maps them. **FeatureCounts** performs the same task, but it is more qualitative than **RNA-STAR** since it is capable of counting not just at the Read level, but also at the UMI level, such that 10 duplicate reads at GeneA will be counted only once. 

Unfortunately, both are limited to counting without being able to distinguish between different cells. 

> ### {% icon details %} Example
>
> e.g. If we consider the number of reads that align to *GeneA*, the output given by these two tools is as follows:
>
> | (reads) | RNA STAR | FeatureCounts |
> |---------|----------|---------------|
> | GeneA   |   12     |    12         |
> 
>
> But what we actually require is:
>
> | (reads) | C1 | C2 |
> |---------|----|----|
> | GeneA   | 10 |  2 |
>
> or more specifically:
>
> | (umis) | C1 | C2 |
> |--------|----|----|
> | GeneA  | 2  |  1 |
{: .details}


In order to obtain this desired format, we must use **UMI-tools count** to perform the tallying. However, this tool is dependent on **FeatureCounts** to annotate our reads with the one crucial piece of information that is missing from our BAM file: the name of the gene.

{: .hands_on}

The `XS` and `XT` tags in the BAM file will now form the basis for which we will tally reads.
With all the relevant data now in our BAM file, we can actually perform the counting via `UMI-tools count`.

The important parameters to take note of are those given in the *Extra Parameters* where we specify that each of the reads with a `XT:Z` tag in the BAM file will be counted on a per cell basis. Reads sharing the same UMI and cell Barcodes will be de-duplicated into a single count, reducing PCR duplicate bias from the analysis.

At this stage, we now have a tabular file containing genes/features as rows, and cell labels as headers.

The generation of a single count matrix is now complete, with the emphasis on the word *single* due to the fact that we often deal in multiple batches of sequencing data.

This concludes the first part of the tutorial which focused on the transformation of raw FASTQ data from a single batch into a count matrix. The second part of this tutorial guides us through the handling of multiple batches, and the challenges faced with different library preperation setups.


# Multiple Batches

[Back to previous](javascript:window.history.back())

 ![Workflow Lower](../../images/scrna_workflow_lower.png "Multiple batch processing")

Handling more than one batch of sequencing data is rather trivial when we take into account our main goals and requirements:

  1. For each batch, convert FASTQ reads from into a count matrix.
  2. Merge all count matrices into a single count matrix

The first step requires us to merely run the same workflow on each of our batches, using the exact same inputs except for the FASTQ paired data. The second step requires a minimal level of interaction from us; namely using a merge tool and selecting our matrices. 


### Data upload and organization

The count matrix we have generated in the previous section is too sparse to perform any reasonable analysis upon, and constitutes data only of a single batch. Here we will use more populated count matrices from multiple batches, under the assumption that we now know how to generate each individual one of them using the steps provided in the previous section. This data is available at [`Zenodo`](https://zenodo.org/record/2554612).

Once again, file naming is important, and so we will rename our matrix files appropriately to the plate and batch they are supposed to originate from.

## Merging Count Matrices

Before we begin, we must consider that our matrices are not equal -- e.g. Batch1 has at least 1 cell that maps to GeneA, whereas Batch2 has no mention of GeneA.

This can be resolved by performing a "Full Join" (as described [here](http://www.sql-join.com/sql-join-types/)) where GeneA is inserted into Batch2 as a gene with 0 counts:

          B1     | C1 | C2 | C3 |                       B2     | C1 | C2 | C3 |
         --------+----+----+----|   + (Full Join) +    --------+----+----+----|
          GeneA  | 3  | 0  | 1  |                       GeneM  |  0 | 3  | 2  |
          GeneM  | 2  | 2  | 1  |                       GeneX  | 10 | 2  | 7  |


      =      Full   | B1_C1 | B1_C2 | B1_C3 | B2_C1 | B2_C2 | B2_C3 |
            --------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------|
             GeneA  |   3   |   0   |   1   |    0  |   0   |    0  | â Exists in B1
             GeneM  |   2   |   2   |   1   |    0  |   3   |    2  | â Common in Both
             GeneX  |   0   |   0   |   0   |   10  |   2   |    7  | â Exists in B2

Let us now merge our matrices from different batches.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Table Merge
> 
> Select **Column Join on Collections** {%icon tool %} with the following parameters:
> - *"Tabular Files"*: (Select each of the matrices that you wish to join)  
> - *"Identifier column"*:`1`  
> - *"Number of Header lines in each item"*:`1`  
> - *"Keep original column header"*:`Yes`  
> - *"Fill character"*:`0`  
>
{: .hands_on}

The identifier column refers to the column where the gene names are listed. A 1:1 correspondence between matrices is checked, so that the merge does not concatenate the wrong rows between matrices. The *Fill character* provides a default value of 0 for cases where a Gene appears only in one of the matrices as per our example earlier.

Once the merge is complete, we can now peek at our full combined matrix by once again clicking on the file name to see a small summary. Here we can see that we now have ~30,000 genes and over 1500 cells.

**Or do we?**

It is true that we have applied the same cell barcodes to each batch -- but -- **not all batches neccesarily use the same barcodes** to select their cells. For example, Batch1 might only use cell barcodes 1-50 in the barcodes file, and Batch2 might only use cell barcodes 51-100 in the barcodes file.
 
We must thus question why different sets of the same superset of barcodes be used on different batches? To answer this, we must understand some of the technicalities of the library preparation.

## Understanding Plates and Batches

[Back to previous](javascript:window.history.back())

Plates are $$N \times M$$ arrays or wells that cells are sorted into and then individually amplified and sequenced. The way these slot are filled depends entirely on the protocol, but usually not all slots are filled. The reason for this will become clear momentarily.

     | . . . . . . . . . |  <- Plate: N=9, M=6        | . . . : . . . : . . . |  <---   Plate: N=9, M=6, 3 lanes
     | . . . . . . . . . |            54 slots        | . . . : . . . : . . . |                54 slots
     | . . . . . . . . . |                            | . . . : . . . : . . . |          Lane: n=3, m=6
     | . . . . . . . . . |                            | . . . : . . . : . . . |                18 slots per lane
     | . . . . . . . . . |                            | . . . : . . . : . . . |
     | . . . . . . . . . |                            | . . . : . . . : . . . |
    

Plates are divided into different sequencing *lanes*. These lanes demarcate evenly-sized $$n\times m$$ rectangular regions on a plate containing different non-overlapping sets of slots on the same plate. 

All slots within a given lane are sequenced at the same time, and because of this characteristic, all cells that fill the slots of a given lane are said to be of the same *batch* (where lanes and batches are usually interchangeable terms).

There are three main variables that can dictate the library preparation setup:

 1. Number of available cell barcodes
 1. Number of slots on a plate
 1. Number of slots in a lane/batch

 
The last two can be explained by exploring different example plating arrangements of the sequencer, and the first can be explained via a better understanding of how cell barcodes are generated.
 
#### A Closer Look at Cell Barcodes

The number of cell barcodes sets the *minimum size of each batch*. If we have only 10 barcodes, then only 10 cells can be uniquely labelled without us having to start reusing barcodes on different cells

> ### {% icon question %} Question
>
> Why would it be bad practice to reuse the same barcodes in a batch?
>
> > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
> >
> > We would not know which cell some reads came from. If CellA uses barcode `ACCTG` and CellB also uses barcode `ACCTG`, then any reads that are sequenced with `ACCTG` in their barcodes could come from either CellA or CellB, making it very amgiguous when it comes to counting that read.
> >
> {: .solution}
{: .question}

The availability of barcodes and the number of cells they can label is a design choice, where the technician must balance two opposing forces: barcode size vs sequencing errors.


> ### {% icon details %} Details: How many available barcodes are there?
>
> Barcodes are typically limited to the 4 main nucleotide bases {A,C,T,G}. The number of available barcodes depends on two factors:

>  2. The edit distance between adjacent barcodes
>
> 
> #### Barcode Size: Theoretical Limit
> 
> For the first, this means that for a barcode $$N$$ bases long, there will $$4^N$$ barcodes available. Typically barcodes tend to span 4-10 bases ($$4^4 = 256$$ to $$4^{10} = 1048576$$), since longer barcodes tend to be more subjectable to sequencing errors.
>

#### Examples of different plating strategies

The main contending questions are:
 * How large is each batch?
 * How many batches on a plate?
 * Should each batch use the same barcodes?
 
A technician always has to balance quality against cost, and this is illustrated in the following examples:

If we see any reads in Plate2 that should not be there, we can now surmise where they came from. We also have the added benefit of protecting the cells in Plate2 from those that may have been used in Plate1, since they are in completely different positions across plates.

Here we can check for cross-contamination in each lane by measuring the real cell labels against the false barcodes. If in lane 1, we detect a significant number of reads with cell barcodes of `TAA` or `ANN`, we can assume that some cross-contamination has occurred since we should not be able to detect these barcodes in that lane. The converse is also true of lane 2.

## Controlling against Cross-Contamination

There are multiple possible ways to configure a plate for sequencing multiple batches. Thankfully, Galaxy provides a tool that caters for this, and checks for cross-contamination in any experimental setup. It requires only the following information:

 1. A full list of barcodes
 2. Which barcodes apply to which batches
 3. Which batches apply to which plates.
 
Since we the plating protocol we are using is that designed by the Freiburg MPI GrÃ¼n lab, we will follow their structure.

This plating protocol can be converted into a more textual format, which allows for many variable setups (see *Help* section of *Cross-contamination Barcode Filter* tool).

    [Barcodes â Batches]
    001-096: B1 , B3 , B5 , B7
    097-192: B2 , B2 , B6 , B8

Let us now apply this protocol to our count matrix, and look for any cross-contamination.

The plot that follows tells us everything we need to know about each of our batches. Each batch is essentially tested against the full set of barcodes in order to assert that only the desired or 'Real' barcodes have been sequenced.

With this, we now have a count-matrix that can be used for further downstream analyis.

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

In this tutorial we have learned the importance of barcoding; namely how to define, extract, and annotate them from our reads and into the read headers, in order to preserve them during mapping. We have discovered how these barcoded reads are transformed into counts, where the cell barcode and UMI barcode are used to denote individual cells and to correct against reads that are PCR duplicates. Finally, we have learned how to combine seperate batch data as well as being able to check and correct against cross-contamination.
