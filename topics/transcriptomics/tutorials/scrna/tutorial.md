# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing has provided the means to explore samples at the individual cell level, enabling a greater understanding of the development and function of such samples by the characteristics of their constituent cells. These cells can be classified into different cell subpopulations or "clusters" by the variation of gene expression in each cell, where cells in the same cluster exhibit the same levels of differential expression in the same set of related genes.

By identifying significant genes in each cluster, cell types can be inferred and similarity between clusters can be determined based on their proximity to one another. If the cells all come from the same sample tissue, the cell types will likely correspond to the different stages of cell differentiation expected of that tissue, wherein a lineage/heirarchy could potentially be derived.

This tutorial is in part inspired by aspects of the [Hemberg workflow](https://hemberg-lab.github.io/scRNA.seq.course/) at the Sangar insititute, as well as the [CGATOxford](https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools) workflow. The barcoding follows the CelSeq2 protocol and uses the lane configuration as that utilized by the Freiburg MPI GrÃ¼n lab.

# Background

Most scRNA sequencing techniques use pooled-sequencing approaches to generate a higher throughput of data by performing to amplification and sequencing upon multiple cells in the same "pool". From a bioinformatics standpoint, this means that the output FASTQ data from the sequencer is batch-specific and contains all the sequences from multiple cells.

The size of these FASTQ files are typically in the gigabyte range and are somewhat impractical for training purposes, so we will expediate the analysis by using a smaller subset of actual batch data. 

## CelSeq2

The CelSeq2 protocol is a paired-end protocol, meaning that the primers contain strand-specific information. In this case; Read1 contains the barcoding information followed by the polyT tail of the messenger RNA, and Read2 contains the actual sequence. Here, Read1 is regarded as the 'forward' strand and Read2 as the 'reverse' strand, though this is more a convention when dealing with paired-end data rather than an indication of the actual strand orientation.

 ![CelSeq2 Scheme](../../images/celseq2_schema.png "Read1 encapsulates the barcodes, and Read2 the mRNA sequence" )


## Barcodes

Barcodes are small random oligonucleotides that are inserted into the captured sequence at a specific point, and provide two pieces of information about the sequence:
  
 1. Which cell the sequence came from
 2. Which transcript the sequence came from

When the sequence is mapped against a reference genome, we can then see which gene locus it aligns to and qualitavely assert that, together with the two pieces of information above, the sequence depicts a transcript from a specific a gene that originated from a specific cell.

{: .question}

> ### {% icon details %} UMIs: Mitigating duplicate transcript counts:
>
> One of the major issues with sequencing is that the read fragments require amplification before they can be sequenced. A gene with a single mRNA transcript will not be detected by most sequencers, so it needs to be duplicated 100-1000x times for the sequencer to 'see' it.
>
> Amplification is an imprecise process however, since some reads are amplified more than others, and subsequent amplification can lead to these over-amplified reads being over-amplified even more, leading to an exponential bias of some reads over others.
>
>  ![Amplification Bias](../../images/scrna_amplif_errors.png "A cell with two reads from different trascripts being amplified unevenly" )
>
> Consider the above example where two reads from different transcripts are amplified unevenly. The resulting frequency table would look like so:
>
>  |  | Reads in Cell 1 |
>  |--|------------------|
>  | Gene Red | 5 |
>  | Gene Blue | 0 |
>  
> But the truth is entirely different (i.e. Gene Red should have 1 count, and Gene Blue should also have 1 count).  
> How do we correct for this bias?
> 
> ### UMIs to the rescue
> 
> **Unique Molecular Identifiers** (or *UMIs*) constitute the second portion of a barcode, where their role is to *uniquely* count reads such that amplicons of the same read are only counted once, e.g:
> 
>  ![Amplification Bias with UMIs](../../images/scrna_amplif_errors_umis.png "A cell with four unique transcripts, two from Gene Red and two from Gene Blue")
> 
> Here, we see two unique transcripts from Gene Red and two unique transcripts from Gene Blue, each given a (coloured) UMI. After amplificaiton, Gene Red has more reads than Gene Blue. If we were to construct a frequency table as before to count the reads, we would have:
> 
>  |  | Reads in Cell 1 |
>  |--|-----------------|
>  | Gene Red | 6 |
>  | Gene Blue | 3 |
>  
>  Which is wrong, because it shows that Red has twice the expression that Blue does. However, we can reconstitute the true count by considering the UMI information:
>  
>  |  | UMI colour  | Reads in Cell 1 |
>  |--|-------------|-----------------|
>  | Gene Red | Pink | 2 |
>  |          | Blue | 4 |
>  | Gene Blue | Brown | 1 |
>  |           | Green | 2 |
>  
> We can then make the decision to ignore the frequencies of these UMIs, and simply count how many *unique* UMIs we see in each gene:
> 
>  |  | Set of UMIs in Gene | UMIs in Cell 1 |
>  |--|---------------------|----------------|
>  | Gene Red | {Pink, Blue} | 2 |
>  | Gene Blue | {Brown, Green} | 2 |
>  
>  Which provides us with the true count of the number of true transcripts for each gene:
>  
>  |  | UMIs in Cell 1 |
>  |--|----------------|
>  | Gene Red | 2 |
>  | Gene Blue | 2 |

### Barcoding Format

We now know the role of UMIs and cell barcodes, but how do we handle them in the analysis?

Let us look at 4 example sequences:

<!-- 

These are reads that all map to ENSDARG00000019692. In [Cell, UMI] format:

(J00182:75:HTKJNBBXX:2:1114:12469:11073|J00182:75:HTKJNBBXX:2:2222:13301:35690|J00182:75:HTKJNBBXX:2:1203:25022:13763|J00182:75:HTKJNBBXX:2:1115:8501:46961)

            Cell  , UMI
1: 46961 -- ACCAGA, GGAAGA
2: 13763 -- GGTAAC, GTCCCA -> same umi, same cell
3: 35690 -- GGTAAC, GTCCCA -> same umi, same cell
4: 11073 -- GGTAAC, CGGCGT -> diff umi, same cell

-->

The Forward reads:

As shown in image 1, the barcode is on the forward read and sequence is on the reverse read. The barcode consists of the 6bp UMI followed by the 6bp cell barcode (followed by the poly-T tail). The sequence is 70 bp long as contains the information that we wish to map. 

Mini Exercise:
Q: How do we know the barcoding format of reads?
A: Usually you are explicitly told, as well being given a list of cell barcodes to use. Most cell barcodes have an edit distance >= 2 between them in order to correct against 1bp read errors.
Q: How do we verify the barcode format of our reads?
A: Look at the FASTQC
 We can see that the distribution of the first 6bp has far more variability than the following 6bp which seems to have less variation. From this we can deduce where the boundaries of our barcodes are.
 SQ: Which side is the cell barcode? Which side the UMI?
 We expect to see more genes than cells, with an absolute maximum of 4**6 UMIs in a given cell. So the left side is the UMIs since there appears to be more of an even distribution, and the right side is the CB since there the variation seems more spiky.
 

### Uniting Barcodes with Sequence

In a sense, we have a disparity in our data: the reverse reads contain the sequences we wish to map, but not the barcodes; the forward reads contain the barcode, but not the sequence. For the forward and reverse reads given above, the information that we really want from both can be summarized in this table:

| Read | Cell | UMI | Sequence |
|------|------|-----|----------|
| @J00182:75:HTKJNBBXX:2:1115:8501:46961  | ACCAGA | GGAAGA | GACCTCTGATCTTTACGAAAGGCCAACGCGTTTTCAGTCTGGACACGGTTCAGCTCCTGTTCATTATTCA |

Mini Exercise:
Q: Which of these reads are duplicates?
Q: Which of these reads come from the same cell?
Q: How many cells in total are depicted here? How many UMIs?

Exercise: These four reads all actually map to same gene. Which gene is it?
 - Take 1 sequence, use BLAT


Q: How should we couple these two source of information into a single location without impacting the data content?

A: We take the barcode information from the forward reads, and stick it into the *header* of the reverse reads. That way we can align our sequence to the reference and still keep the barcode information assosciated with the reads.

where we have added CellBarcode_UMI to the headers of each read. We can now throw away our forward reads, as they have no more useful information within them and proceed to the mapping stage.

# Mapping

Mapping is a relatively straightforward process:

 1. Select your genome
 2. Select your GTF file
 3. Run MultiQC on the resulting STAR log

The FASTQ data was generated from sequencing Zebra working with Zebrafish data, so to perform the alignment we will need to gather all data relevant to that genome. We will use the latest version (DanRerv10).

The fields of the BAM file can be better explained at section 1.4 of [the SAM specification](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf), but we will summarize the main fields of interest here:

 * `J00182..._GACGAA_GCGGTC`: The *readname* appended by an underscore '_', the cell barcode, another '_', and then the UMI barcode.
 * `16`: The FLAG value, which can be explained in the SAM specification, or more interactively [here](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html).
> ### {% icon question %} What does the FLAG value of 16 tell us about this read?
> > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
>
> The read aligns to the reverse strand

 * `chr1` `2030`: The position and base-pair of alignment of the first base of the sequence.
 * We next have a series of quality fields, as well as the `sequence` and `sequence_quality`
 * `NH`: The number of hits for  this read. If it is multiply mapped, then the number of multiples will be shown (here `2`)
 * `HI`: Which number this particular read is in the series of (potentially) multi-mapped reads (here `1`, not neccesarily meaning the first or 'better' )
 * `nM`: The number of mismatches in the alignment of this read to the reference (here `2`)

This fields will be important later when we wish to filter our BAM for good quality reads.

Notice that we are missing one crucial piece of information in our BAM file: the name of the gene.
Once we have the name of the gene for a specific read, we can tally how many of those reads fall into that gene and generate a count matrix.

Unfortunately, *`STAR`* can only annotate and count reads at the gene-level and not the gene-cell level, i.e. if 2 different cells have reads of 5 and 6 respectively at GeneA, STAR will simply say that there are 11 reads at GeneA without regard to the cells.

## Counting with FeatureCounts

FeatureCounts is a tool which answers the simple question: "How many reads bisect GeneX?"
It is more qualitative that STAR however, since it is capable of counting not just at the Read level, but at the UMI level, such that 10 duplicate reads at GeneA will be counted only once. It also has the added benefit of being able to count at the individual cell level, providing a mechanism to produce our count matrices.

>  - Here we can see now that we have an extra `XT:Z` tag with the name of our gene appended.
>  - This tag will be the basis of the row names in our count matrix.


## Quality Control

If we perform counting on the Alignment file we just generated with *FeatureCounts* we will be counting all the reads in the BAM file, but this may not be desireable if we still wish to select only high quality reads.

The main filtering steps performed on our reads so far have been relatively silent due to the 'default' parameters used.
 * *UMI-tools Extract* - Filters reads for those only with matching barcodes given by our barcodes file.
 * *RNA-STAR* - As seen in the log, we lose 10% of our reads for being too short or being multiply mapped.


### Further QC

Another filtering measure we can apply is to keep reads that we are confident about, e.g those with a minimum number of mismatches to the reference within an acceptable range.

## Counting Genes / Cell

With all the relevant data now in our BAM file, we can actually perform the counting via `UMI-tools count`.

The important parameters to take note of were those given in the *Extra Parameters* where we have specified that each of the reads with a `XT:Z` tag in the BAM file will be counted on a per cell basis. Reads sharing the same UMI and cell Barcodes will be de-duplicated into a single count, reducing PCR duplicate bias from the analysis.

Once the output file is green, we can now peek at the dataset and see how many cells and genes/features we have. To do this, it is actually better to look at the file summary by clicking on the title of the file instead of the eye symbol.

<!-- image of file summary -->

Here we can see that we have ~ 23,000 lines corresponding to the number of genes in our dataset. If we scroll to the right we can see that we have ~ 200 columns corresponding to the number of cells.

This in itself completes the generation of a single count matrix, with the emphasis on the word *single* due to the unforgettable fact that we often deal in multiple batches of sequencing data, and not just a single batch.


# Multiple Batches

Handling more than one batch of sequencing data is rather trivial when we take into account our main goals and requirements:

  1. For each batch, convert FASTQ reads from into a count matrix.
  2. Merge all count matrices into a single count matrix

<!-- image of this process -->

The first step requires us to merely run the same workflow on each of our batches, using the exact same inputs except for the FASTQ paired data.

The second step requires a minimal level of interaction from us; namely using a merge tool and selecting our matrices. 

## Merging our Matrices

Before we begin, we must consider that each of our matrices are not equal.

 e.g. Batch1 has at least 1 cell that maps to GeneA, whereas Batch2 has no mention of GeneA

This can be resolved by performing a "Full Join" (as described [here](http://www.sql-join.com/sql-join-types/)) where GeneA is inserted into Batch2 as a gene with 0 counts:

 | Batch1 | C1 | C2 | C3 |
 |--------|----|----|----|
 | GeneA  | 3  | 0  | 1  |

       + (Full Join) +

 | Batch2 | C1 | C2 | C3 |
 |--------|----|----|----|
 | GeneX  | 10 | 2  | 7  |

      =

 | Full   | B1_C1 | B1_C2 | B1_C3 | B_C1 | B_C2 | B_C3 |
 |--------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
 | GeneA  | 3  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  |  0 |
 | GeneX  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 10 | 2  |  7 |

Let us now merge our matrices from different batches.

> ### {% icon Hands-on %} Table Merge
> 
> Select **Column Join on Collections** {%icon tool %} with the following parameters:
>  - *"Tabular Files"*: Select each of the matrices that you wish to join
>  - *"Identifier column"*:`1`
>  - *"Number of Header lines in each item"*:`1`
>  - *"Keep original column header":`Yes`
>  - *"Fill character"*:`0`
{.hands-on}

The identifier column refers to the gene names are checked for 1:1 correspondence between matrices so that the merge does not concatenate the wrong rows between matrices. The Fill character provides a default value of 0 for cases where a Gene appears only in one of the matrices as per our example earlier.

Once the merge is complete, we can now peek at our full combined matrix by once again clicking on the file name to see a small summary. Here we can see that we now have ~30,000 genes and over 1500 cells.

**Or do we?**

We have applied the same cell barcodes to each batch, but not all batches neccesarily use the same barcodes to select their cells. 

 e.g. Batch1 might only use cell barcodes 1-50 in the barcodes file, and Batch2 might only user cell barcodes 51-100 in the barcodes file.

### Another Look At Cell Barcodes

The number of cell barcodes sets the *minimum size of each batch*. If we have only 10 barcodes, then only 10 cells can be uniquely labelled without us having to start reusing barcodes on different cells

> ### {% icon question %} Why would it be bad to reuse the same barcodes in a batch?

> >
> > Because we would not know which cell some reads came from. If CellA uses barcode ACCTG and CellB also uses barcode ACCTG, then any reads that are sequenced with ACCTG in their barcodes could come from either CellA or CellB, making it very amgiguous when it comes to counting that read.
> {.solution}
{.question}

How many available barcodes are there?

This depends on two factors:
   * The size of the barcode
   * The edit distance between adjacent barcodes
   
Barcodes are typically limited to the 4 main nucleotide bases A,C,T,G. Barcodes also tend to span 4-10 bases, since longer barcodes tend to be more subjectable to sequencing errors.

 * Barcodes that are 4bp long have 4^4 = 256 unique barcodes to choose from.
 * Barcodes that are 10bp long have 4^10 = 1,048,576 unique barcodes to choose from. 
 
 Again, the shorter the better to reduce the number of sequencing errors, but at the cost of being able to sequence less in a single batch.
 
#### Reducing sequencing errors in barcodes

Single base-pair sequencing errors are the most prevalent type of sequencing error, but these can be catered for when selecting barcodes, by specifying an *edit distance* between adjacent barcodes.

e.g. For barcodes of length 3: 
   * Instead of : AAA AAC AAG AAT ACA ACC ... etc, (edit distance of 1)
   * We can use : AAA ACC AGG ATT CAA CCC ... etc, (edit distance of 2)
   
This will reduce the number of barcodes that we can select however:

  * For barcodes of length *N*:
    * An edit distance of 1 provides 4^N possible barcodes.
    * An edit distance of 2 provides 4^(N-1) possible barcodes.
    * An edit distance of *E* provides 4^(N-E) possible barcodes, where 0 < E < N


# Plates, Batches, and Cross-contamination

Plates are *N*x*M* arrays. The way these slot are filled depends entirely on the protocol, but usually not all slots are filled. The reason for this will become clear momentarily.

    | . . . . . . . . . |  <- Plate: N=9, M=6, 54 slots
    | . . . . . . . . . |
    | . . . . . . . . . |
    | . . . . . . . . . |
    | . . . . . . . . . |
    | . . . . . . . . . |
    

Plates are divided into different sequencing lanes. These lanes demarcate evenly-sized *n*x*m* rectangular regions on a plate containing different non-overlapping sets of slots on the same plate. 

    | . . . : . . . : . . . |  <---   Plate: N=9, M=6, 54 slots
    | . . . : . . . : . . . |       3 lanes: n=3,m=6, 18 slots per lane/batch
    | . . . : . . . : . . . |
    | . . . : . . . : . . . |
    | . . . : . . . : . . . |
    | . . . : . . . : . . . |


All slots within a given lane are sequenced at the same time, and because of this characteristic, all cells that fill the slots of a given lane are said to be of the same Batch. From hereon we will refer to sequencing lanes as Batches. 

There are 3 main variables that can dictate the library preparation setup:

 1. The number of available cell barcodes
 2. The number of slots on a plate
 3. The number of slots in a batch
 
Main contending questions:
 * How large is each batch?
 * How many batches on a plate?
 * Should each batch use the same barcodes?
 
To answer these questions, consider the following illustrative examples:
    
#### Examples

For each of these examples, we will consider our experiment to have the following setup:
   * Barcodes:
      * 24 unique, with an edit distance of 2:
      
          AAA ACC AGG TTT TAA TCC
          ATT CCC CAA TGG NAA NCC
          CGG CTT GGG NGG NTT ANN
          GAA GCC GTT CNN GNN TNN
                  
   * Lanes:
     * Each lane will have 12 slots
     * No more than 2 lanes can be sequenced at the same time.
       (e.g. if we have 4 lanes, on a plate, then half the plate will be sequenced in a run, and the other half in another run)
   
    
 * e.g.1 

We have a single plate with a single lane

    | x x x |    <- AAA ACC AGT
    | x x x |       ATT CCC CAA
    | x x x |       CGG CTT GGG
    | x x x |       GAA GCC GTT

Half of the barcodes can be used for that lane, and the other half we can ignore.


 * e.g.2 

We have a single plate with 2 lanes

    | x x x : x x x | <- AAA ACC AGG : TTT TAA TCC
    | x x x : x x x |    ATT CCC CAA : TGG NAA NCC
    | x x x : x x x |    CGG CTT GGG : NGG NTT ANN
    | x x x : x x x |    GAA GCC GTT : CNN GNN TNN

Here we use all barcodes since these lanes will be sequenced at the same time. 

 * e.g.3

We have a single plate with 2 lanes, but only one lane in the plate is used and the other lane is empty.

    | x x x : . . . | <- AAA ACC AGG : TTT TAA TCC
    | x x x : . . . |    ATT CCC CAA : TGG NAA NCC
    | x x x : . . . |    CGG CTT GGG : NGG NTT ANN
    | x x x : . . . |    GAA GCC GTT : CNN GNN TNN


Here we use all barcodes.

> ### {% icon question %} Why use all barcodes? Why leave an empty lane?
> > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
>
> > Cross-contamination. If we see any reads in the Plate which contain barcodes {TTT,TAA,TCC, etc} then we know that some contamination has occured *because there should be no cells there*. One reason is that the second lane was not completely cleaned before being used. 

 * e.g.4

We have a two plates with 2 lanes, but only one lane in each plate is used and the other lane is empty.

    | x x x : . . . | P1 <- AAA ACC AGG : TTT TAA TCC
    | x x x : . . . |       ATT CCC CAA : TGG NAA NCC
    | x x x : . . . |       CGG CTT GGG : NGG NTT ANN
    | x x x : . . . |       GAA GCC GTT : CNN GNN TNN

    | . . . : x x x | P2 <- AAA ACC AGG : TTT TAA TCC
    | . . . : x x x |       ATT CCC CAA : TGG NAA NCC
    | . . . : x x x |       CGG CTT GGG : NGG NTT ANN
    | . . . : x x x |       GAA GCC GTT : CNN GNN TNN

Here we again use all barcodes for both plates, but each plate uses a different subset of the barcodes for the filled slots. i.e. They use different sets of 'Real' and 'Fake' barcodes.

> ### {% icon question %} Why alternate the barcodes between plates? The full set of barcodes does not change, so why not keep the same format?
> > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
>
> > Again, the answer is to reduce cross-contamination. Plate2 will be loaded after Plate1 (and perhaps Plate2 and Plate1 will use the same plate!) If we see any reads in Plate2 that should not be there, we can now surmise where they came from. We also have the added benefit of protecting the cells Plate2 from those that may have been used in Plate1, since they are in completely different positions across plates.


## Controlling against Cross-Contamination

Thankfully, Galaxy provides a tool for checking for cross-contamination in any experimental setup. It only needs the following information:

 1. A full list of barcodes
 2. Which barcodes apply to which batches
 3. Which batches apply to which plates.
 
Since we the plating protocol we are using is that designed by the Freiburg MPI GrÃ¼n lab, we will follow their structure.

* Barcodes:

These are each 8bp long, with an edit distance of 2, and there 192 of them.

    001-006 | AACACC AACCTC AACGAG AACTGG AAGCAC AAGCCA
    007-012 | AAGGTG AAGTGC ACAAGC ACAGAC ACAGGA ACAGTG
       .
       .
    180-186 | TTACGC TTCACC TTCCAG TTCGAC TTCTCG TTGCAC
    187-192 | TTGCGA TTGCTG TTGGAG TTGGCA TTGGTC TTGTGC
 
 * Plates:
 
Here we have 8 batches spread out over 2 plates, with alternate barcode striping.
          
      Plate 1  +-------+-------+-------+-------+
               |  B1   |  B2   |  B3   |  B4   |
               +-------+-------+-------+-------+
                001-096 097-192 001-096 097-192
      
      Plate 2  +-------+-------+-------+-------+
               |  B5   |  B6   |  B7   |  B8   |
               +-------+-------+-------+-------+
                001-096 097-192 001-096 097-192
                
This plating protocol can be reformatted as:

    [Barcodes â Batches]
    001-096: B1 , B3 , B5 , B7
    097-192: B2 , B2 , B6 , B8

    [Plates â Batches]
    1: B1 , B2 , B3 , B4
    2: B5 , B6 , B7 , B8

This format allows for many variable setups (see *Help* section of *Cross-contamination Barcode Filter* tool)

The plot that follows tells us everything we need to know about each of our batches. Each batch is essentially tested against the full set of barcodes in order to assert that only the desired or 'Real' barcodes have been sequenced.

 ![Contamination Plots](../../images/scrna_crosscontamination.gif) "The Pre-filter and Post-filter plots")

In the pre-filter plot, we can see how only half of the sequences in each batch map to half the barcodes. This shows very little cross-contamination, and shows that our data is real. 

The post-filter plot essentially removes the false barcodes from each batch and retains only the 'Real' barcodes.

With this, we now have a count-matrix that can be used for further downstream analyis.

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

In this tutorial we have learned the importance of barcoding; namely how to define, extract, and annotate them from our reads and into the read headers, in order to preserve them during mapping. We have discovered how these barcoded reads are transformed into counts, where the cell barcode and UMI barcode are used to denote individual cells and to correct against reads that are PCR duplicates. Finally, we have learned how to combine seperate batch data as well as being able to check and correct against cross-contamination.
