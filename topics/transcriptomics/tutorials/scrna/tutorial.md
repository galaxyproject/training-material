# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing has provided the means to explore samples at the individual cell level, enabling a greater understanding of the development and function of such samples by the characteristics of their constituent cells. These cells can be classified into different cell subpopulations or "clusters" by the variation of gene expression in each cell, where cells in the same cluster exhibit the same levels of differential expression in the same set of related genes.

By identifying significant genes in each cluster, cell types can be inferred and similarity between clusters can be determined based on their proximity to one another. If the cells all come from the same sample tissue, the cell types will likely correspond to the different stages of cell differentiation expected of that tissue, wherein a lineage/heirarchy could potentially be derived.

This tutorial is in part inspired by aspects of the [Hemberg workflow](https://hemberg-lab.github.io/scRNA.seq.course/) at the Sangar insititute, as well as the [CGATOxford](https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools) workflow. The barcoding follows the CelSeq2 protocol and uses the lane configuration as that utilized by the Freiburg MPI GrÃ¼n lab.

# Background

Most scRNA sequencing techniques use pooled-sequencing approaches to generate a higher throughput of data by performing to amplification and sequencing upon multiple cells in the same "pool". From a bioinformatics standpoint, this means that the output FASTQ data from the sequencer is batch-specific and contains all the sequences from multiple cells.

The size of these FASTQ files are typically in the gigabyte range and are somewhat impractical for training purposes, so we will expediate the analysis by using a smaller subset of actual batch data. 

## CelSeq2

The CelSeq2 protocol is a paired-end protocol, meaning that the primers contain strand-specific information. In this case; Read1 contains the barcoding information followed by the polyT tail of the messenger RNA, and Read2 contains the actual sequence. Here, Read1 is regarded as the 'forward' strand and Read2 as the 'reverse' strand, though this is more a convention when dealing with paired-end data rather than an indication of the actual strand orientation.

 ![CelSeq2 Scheme](../../images/celseq2_schema.png "Read1 encapsulates the barcodes, and Read2 the mRNA sequence" )


## Barcodes

Barcodes are small random oligonucleotides that are inserted into the captured sequence at a specific point, and provide two pieces of information about the sequence:
  
 1. Which cell the sequence came from
 2. Which transcript the sequence came from

When the sequence is mapped against a reference genome, we can then see which gene locus it aligns to and qualitavely assert that, together with the two pieces of information above, the sequence depicts a transcript from a specific a gene that originated from a specific cell.

> ### {% icon details %} UMIs: Mitigating duplicate transcript counts:
>
> One of the major issues with sequencing is that the read fragments require amplification before they can be sequenced. A gene with a single mRNA transcript will not be detected by most sequencers, so it needs to be duplicated 100-1000x times for the sequencer to 'see' it.
>
> Amplification is an imprecise process however, since some reads are amplified more than others, and subsequent amplification can lead to these over-amplified reads being over-amplified even more, leading to an exponential bias of some reads over others.
>
>  ![Amplification Bias](../../images/scrna_amplif_errors.png "A cell with two reads from different trascripts being amplified unevenly" )
>
> Consider the above example where two reads from different transcripts are amplified unevenly. The resulting frequency table would look like so:
>
>  |  | Reads in Cell 1 |
>  |--|------------------|
>  | Gene Red | 5 |
>  | Gene Blue | 0 |
>  
> But the truth is entirely different (i.e. Gene Red should have 1 count, and Gene Blue should also have 1 count).  
> How do we correct for this bias?
> 
> ### UMIs to the rescue
> 
> **Unique Molecular Identifiers** (or *UMIs*) constitute the second portion of a barcode, where their role is to *uniquely* count reads such that amplicons of the same read are only counted once, e.g:
> 
>  ![Amplification Bias with UMIs](../../images/scrna_amplif_errors_umis.png "A cell with four unique transcripts, two from Gene Red and two from Gene Blue")
> 
> Here, we see two unique transcripts from Gene Red and two unique transcripts from Gene Blue, each given a (coloured) UMI. After amplificaiton, Gene Red has more reads than Gene Blue. If we were to construct a frequency table as before to count the reads, we would have:
> 
>  |  | Reads in Cell 1 |
>  |--|-----------------|
>  | Gene Red | 6 |
>  | Gene Blue | 3 |
>  
>  Which is wrong, because it shows that Red has twice the expression that Blue does. However, we can reconstitute the true count by considering the UMI information:
>  
>  |  | UMI colour  | Reads in Cell 1 |
>  |--|-------------|-----------------|
>  | Gene Red | Pink | 2 |
>  |          | Blue | 4 |
>  | Gene Blue | Brown | 1 |
>  |           | Green | 2 |
>  
> We can then make the decision to ignore the frequencies of these UMIs, and simply count how many *unique* UMIs we see in each gene:
> 
>  |  | Set of UMIs in Gene | UMIs in Cell 1 |
>  |--|---------------------|----------------|
>  | Gene Red | {Pink, Blue} | 2 |
>  | Gene Blue | {Brown, Green} | 2 |
>  
>  Which provides us with the true count of the number of true transcripts for each gene:
>  
>  |  | UMIs in Cell 1 |
>  |--|----------------|
>  | Gene Red | 2 |
>  | Gene Blue | 2 |

### Barcoding Format

We now know the role of UMIs and cell barcodes, but how do we handle them in the analysis?

Let us look at 4 example sequences:

<!-- 

These are reads that all map to ENSDARG00000019692. In [Cell, UMI] format:

(J00182:75:HTKJNBBXX:2:1114:12469:11073|J00182:75:HTKJNBBXX:2:2222:13301:35690|J00182:75:HTKJNBBXX:2:1203:25022:13763|J00182:75:HTKJNBBXX:2:1115:8501:46961)

            Cell  , UMI
1: 46961 -- ACCAGA, GGAAGA
2: 13763 -- GGTAAC, GTCCCA -> same umi, same cell
3: 35690 -- GGTAAC, GTCCCA -> same umi, same cell
4: 11073 -- GGTAAC, CGGCGT -> diff umi, same cell

-->

The Forward reads:

As shown in image 1, the barcode is on the forward read and sequence is on the reverse read. The barcode consists of the 6bp UMI followed by the 6bp cell barcode (followed by the poly-T tail). The sequence is 70 bp long as contains the information that we wish to map. 

Mini Exercise:
Q: How do we know the barcoding format of reads?
A: Usually you are explicitly told, as well being given a list of cell barcodes to use. Most cell barcodes have an edit distance >= 2 between them in order to correct against 1bp read errors.
Q: How do we verify the barcode format of our reads?
A: Look at the FASTQC
 We can see that the distribution of the first 6bp has far more variability than the following 6bp which seems to have less variation. From this we can deduce where the boundaries of our barcodes are.
 SQ: Which side is the cell barcode? Which side the UMI?
 We expect to see more genes than cells, with an absolute maximum of 4**6 UMIs in a given cell. So the left side is the UMIs since there appears to be more of an even distribution, and the right side is the CB since there the variation seems more spiky.
 

### Uniting Barcodes with Sequence

In a sense, we have a disparity in our data: the reverse reads contain the sequences we wish to map, but not the barcodes; the forward reads contain the barcode, but not the sequence. For the forward and reverse reads given above, the information that we really want from both can be summarized in this table:

| Read | Cell | UMI | Sequence |
|------|------|-----|----------|
| @J00182:75:HTKJNBBXX:2:1115:8501:46961  | ACCAGA | GGAAGA | GACCTCTGATCTTTACGAAAGGCCAACGCGTTTTCAGTCTGGACACGGTTCAGCTCCTGTTCATTATTCA |

Mini Exercise:
Q: Which of these reads are duplicates?
Q: Which of these reads come from the same cell?
Q: How many cells in total are depicted here? How many UMIs?

Exercise: These four reads all actually map to same gene. Which gene is it?
 - Take 1 sequence, use BLAT


Q: How should we couple these two source of information into a single location without impacting the data content?

A: We take the barcode information from the forward reads, and stick it into the *header* of the reverse reads. That way we can align our sequence to the reference and still keep the barcode information assosciated with the reads.

where we have added CellBarcode_UMI to the headers of each read. We can now throw away our forward reads, as they have no more useful information within them and proceed to the mapping stage.


# Barcode Extraction

# Mapping

Mapping is a relatively straightforward process:

 1. Select your genome
 2. Select your GTF file
 3. Run MultiQC on the resulting STAR log

The FASTQ data was generated from sequencing Zebra working with Zebrafish data, so to perform the alignment we will need to gather all data relevant to that genome. We will use the latest version (DanRerv10).

> ### {% icon Hands-on %} Performing the Alignment

> 1. Obtain the GTF file and import it into our history.

> 2. Select **RNA-STAR** {%icon tool %} with the following parameters:
>   - *"Single End"*: Our input FASTQ has sequencing data from only a single read
>   - *"RNA-Seq FASTQ/FASTA file"*: Of the FASTQ files output by UMI_tools extract, select the one with the sequencing reads intact.
>   - *"Custom or built-in reference"*: `Use a built-in index`
>   - *"Reference genome with or without an annotation"*: `use genome reference without builtin gene-model`

>   - *"Gene model (gff3,gtf) file for splice junctions"*: Select the GTF file we imported into our history
>   - Execute

This should take a minute or two depending on your position in the queue. Once your output files are green, proceed to the next step.

The fields of the BAM file can be better explained at section 1.4 of [the SAM specification](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf), but we will summarize the main fields of interest here:

 * `J00182..._GACGAA_GCGGTC`: The *readname* appended by an underscore '_', the cell barcode, another '_', and then the UMI barcode.
 * `16`: The FLAG value, which can be explained in the SAM specification, or more interactively [here](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html).
