### Sorting Plates


.image-100[![slide5](../../images/wab96wellplate.svg)]

.left[Plates are *N x M* arrays of wells that cells are sorted, to then be individually amplified and sequenced.]

### Setting up Plates

.center[Can't mix samples on plates? Separate replicates evenly and process together.]

???

If putting multiple treatments on the same plate is not an option, then having enough separated replicates will also allow for batch correction. Here, you can assess the variation between replicates (and thus batches) as well as between treatments.

### What about sequencing lanes?

.center[So now it's time to sequence our samples! How do we combine samples into sequencing lanes?]

.image-90[![slide7](../../images/wabseqlane.png)]

.center[This works well, but what if you have too many samples for one lane?]

### What about sequencing lanes?

.center[No! You've turned each treatment (A & B) into a batch!]

### Distinguishing cells in a plate

.image-60[![slide11](../../images/wabplate.png)]


* Cells are selected from a plate by their *barcodes*
* Barcodes must be unique
  + e.g. 96 wells in a plate, need 96 barcodes to sequence them together

---

### What are Cell Barcodes?

.image-100[![Add Barcodes](../../images/scrna_pbb_barcodes_add.svg)]

* Barcodes are added to *all* transcripts of a *specific* cell
* Transcripts with different cell barcodes originate from different cells

???


---

### What are Cell Barcodes?

.image-100[![Barcodes in Plate](../../images/scrna_pbb_barcodes_overview.svg)]

* Many different cell barcodes are used across many different cells
* Each well in a plate contains a cell, indexed by its cell barcode

---

### Questions about Cell Barcodes


.image-50[![slide14](../../images/wabplate.png)]

.left[Assuming you sequence one 96-well plate:]

1. How many cell barcodes are needed for a single lane?

1. How many cell barcodes are needed if you combine 10 plates into a single sequencing lane?

1. What would be the minimum length of the barcodes for each of the previous questions?
--
.footnote[
1. *96 unique barcodes per lane*
1. *96 x 10 = 960 unique barcodes per plate*

### Questions about Cell Barcodes

.left[<small>3) What would be the minimum length of the barcodes for each of the previous questions?</small>]

.pull-left[

A single lane?

 * 96 barcodes, 4 nucleotides for each base of a barcode

| Barcodes | Result |
|---------|------|
| $$4^2 =  16$$ | <small>No, 2 bases is not enough |
| $$4^3  = 64$$ | <small>No, 3 bases is not enough |
| $$4^4 = 256$$ | <small>Yes, 4 bases is enough to cover 96 barcodes (and more!) |

]
--
.pull-right[

10 plates in a single lane?

 * 960 barcodes, 4 nucleotides for each base of a barcode

| Barcodes | Result |
|---------|------|
|$$4^4 = 256$$ | <small>No, 4 bases is not enough |
|$$4^5 = 1024$$ | <small>Yes, 5 bases is enough to cover 960 barcodes (just barely!) |

 * The MathJax selector seems to apply directly to the element, which is impossible to override!
 -->

.pull-left[
* Is 5 nucleotides really enough to capture 960 cells?

* What could go wrong if all barcodes are separated by 1 bp, as shown?
]

.pull-right[
<small>*Edit distance = 1bp*

???
If we assume that every barcode is separated from every other barcode by 1 bp, then the answer is 'yes'

That's right, sequencing errors can mislabel a read to a completely different cell than from where the transcript originated from.

### Guarding against Sequencing Errors

.pull-left[
* Sequencing errors can change the cell barcode

* To guard against a 1 bp sequencing error, need to space barcodes by 2 bp

* How many barcodes for a cell barcode of length 5 bp (ED = 2)?

.pull-right[
<small>*Edit Distance = 2 bp*

### Edit Distance : General Principle

.pull-left[
e.g. For barcodes of length N=3:

* Edit Distance of E=1:
.center[`AAA AAC AAG AAT ACA ACC` ...]
.center[<small>64 barcodes</small>]

* Edit Distance of E=2:
.center[`AAA ACC AGG ATT CAA CCC` ...]
.center[<small>16 barcodes</small>]

* Edit Distance of E=3:
.center[`AAA CCC GGG TTT`]
.center[<small>4 barcodes</small>]
]
--
.pull-right[
Number of Barcodes :

$$ 4^{N-(E-1)} $$

.center[For barcodes of length *N*,
and Edit Distance of *E*.]

]

---

### How many available barcodes are there?

.pull-left[
* Barcodes typically limited to 4 main bases {A,C,T,G}.

* Number of available barcodes depends on:

  1. The length of the barcode

  2. The edit distance between adjacent barcodes

* Must take sequencing errors into account

]
--
.pull-right[
* Availability is balance between *barcode size* vs. *sequencing errors*

* Typically between 4-10 bases, range of cells that can be labelled:

   $$[4^4, 4^{10}] = [256, 1048576]$$


* True range is lower due to edit distance.
]

???
* The availability of barcodes and the number of cells they can label is a design choice, where the technician must balance two opposing forces: barcode size vs sequencing errors.

* For the first, this means that for a barcode $$N$$ bases long, there will $$4^N$$ barcodes available. Typically barcodes tend to span 4-10 bases ($$4^4 = 256$$ to $$4^{10} = 1048576$$), since longer barcodes tend to be more subjectable to sequencing errors.

* The true number of barcodes used is actually smaller than $$4^N$$ due to the measures used to space barcodes apart from one another to reduce sequencing errors.

---

### Design Factors in Barcodes

Is it better to use Longer or Shorter Barcodes?

  | Longer | Shorter |
  |--------|---------|
  | Offer larger range of barcodes | Offer smaller range of barcodes |
  | Prone to more sequencing errors | More robust against sequencing errors |
  | Must increase edit distance significantly | A smaller edit distance is more acceptable |
  | Can accommodate large edit distances | *Cannot* accommodate large edit distances |

---

### Cell Barcodes: Summary

.pull-left[

* A single barcode sequence indexes a single cell

* Every transcript in a specific cell has the same cell barcode

* Barcodes are *designed* for smaller plate-based protocols, while for split-pool and similar techniques they are randomised.

* Barcode use is *limited* by length and read depth

???
The number of reads you want per cell determines how many cells you run in a sequencing lane, which in turn tells you how many barcodes you need.
