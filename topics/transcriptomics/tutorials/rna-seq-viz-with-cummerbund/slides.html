# Visualization of RNA-Seq results with CummeRbund


---

  ## Requirements

  Before diving into this slide deck, we recommend you to have a look at:

  
    
  - [Galaxy introduction](/training-material/topics//introduction/)
    
  
    
  - [Quality control](/training-material/topics//sequence-analysis/)

### <img class="emoji" title=":grey_question:" alt=":grey_question:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2754.png" height="20" width="20"> Questions


- How are RNA-Seq results stored?

- Why are visualization techniques needed?

- How to select our desired subjects for differential gene expression analysis?


---

### <img class="emoji" title=":dart:" alt=":dart:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f3af.png" height="20" width="20"> Objectives


- Manage RNA-Seq results

- Extract the desired subject for differential gene expression analysis

- Visualize information


---

# Why visualization?

???
Data alone does not bring any information: to carry information, data needs to be contextualized. Transcriptomic data is no exception, therefore to organize the growing body of knowledge pertaining RNA-Seq experiments and infer valuable insights, data needs to be organized, annotated, and ultimately visualized.

---

### Where is my data coming from?

![Wang et al, Nat Rev Genet, 2009](../../images/cummerbund-rna-seq-experiment.jpg)

&lt;small&gt;[*Wang et al, Nat Rev Genet, 2009*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2949280/)&lt;/small&gt;

???
- RNAs are converted into cDNA fragments through RNA fragmentation
- sequencing adaptors (in blue) are then added to each cDNA fragment
- cDNA sequences are obtained via NGS sequencing
- the obtained reads are subsequently aligned against a reference genome or transcriptome, and classified in-silico as exonic reads, junction reads, and poly-A reads
- these three types are then used to outline an expression profile for each gene

This is the process that will:

- reveal new genes and splice variants
- help quantifying cell-specific gene expression within the genome under study

But once this pipeline is implemented, how are sequence data going to be analysed and managed?

---

### Bioinformatic tools for RNA-Seq analysis

Once the RNA-Seq pipeline is implemented, we still need to handle and analyse all data that is generated. This requires:

- computer science skills to be handled

- mathematical knowledge to be interpreted

---

### Bioinformatic tools for RNA-Seq analysis

![Trapnell et al, Nat Protoc, 2012](../../images/cummerbund-rna-seq-experiment-tuxedo.jpg)

&lt;small&gt;[*Trapnell et al, Nat Protoc, 2012*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3334321/)&lt;/small&gt;
???
- first, reads from each condition are mapped to the reference genome using TopHat
- the resulting alignment files are given to Cufflinks, which generates a transcriptome assembly for each condition
- the two assemblies are then merged together to provides a uniform basis for calculating of gene and transcript expression in each condition
- both reads and merged assemblies are fed to CuffDiff, to calculate expression levels via statistical significance test for the observed changes

---

### Bioinformatic tools for RNA-Seq analysis

The last step in our RNA-Seq analysis is CuffDiff. Its output comprises multiple files containing the results of the differential expression analysis.

- Gene expression levels are reported as &lt;i&gt;tab-separated&lt;/i&gt; values: a simple tabular output that can be viewed with any spreadsheet application. Such files contain statistics, gene-related, and transcript-related attributes
.image-75[![CuffDiff output](../../images/cummerbund-cuffdiff-output.png)]

- Another way to collect all these data is to organize it within a dedicated database for later consultation. CuffDiff can be instructed to do so
.image-50[![CuffDiff output SQLite](../../images/cummerbund-cuffdiff-set-sqlite.png)]

???
- CuffDiff provides analyses of differential expression and regulation at the gene and transcript level
- its results are reported in a tab separated format
- the overall collection of data is difficult to read to obtain a bird's-eye view of the change of expression
- the data can be organized in a SQLite database

---

### Bioinformatic tools for RNA-Seq analysis

Whatever storage strategy you opted for, i.e. multiple tab-separated-value files or a SQLite database, all data is still retained within text format.

We need to have a bird's-eye view of that data, and &lt;i&gt;make sense&lt;/i&gt; of it

---

# Visualization

---

### CummeRbund

[CummeRbund](http://compbio.mit.edu/cummeRbund/) is an R package for visualizing the results of a CuffDiff output.

- Manages, integrates, and visualizes all data produced by CuffDiff

- Simplifies data exploration

- Provides a bird's-eye view of the expression analysis

- Helps creating publication-ready plots

---

### CummeRbund

CummeRbund needs to be instructed on which data to be visualized:

- &lt;i&gt;Extract CuffDiff&lt;/i&gt;'s "Transcript differential expression testing" table

- &lt;i&gt;Filter&lt;/i&gt; the table on the column storing the significance of a differentially expressed gene

- &lt;i&gt;Sort&lt;/i&gt; all entries on the basis of most significant differentially expressed gene

- Identify the most significant differentially expressed gene

---

### CummeRbund

Once the most significant differentially expressed gene has been identified, CummeRbund can generate publication-ready plots to highlight...

.image-50[![CummeRbund Expression plot](../../images/cummerbund-expression-plot.png)]

The expression of all isoforms of the single gene with replicate FPKMs

---

### CummeRbund

Once the most significant differentially expressed gene has been identified, CummeRbund can generate publication-ready plots to highlight...

.image-50[![CummeRbund Expression plot](../../images/cummerbund-expression-bar-plot.png)]

The expression bar-plot of all isoforms of a gene with replicate FPKMs

### CummeRbund

...and many more

Have a look at [CummerBund's tutorial](https://bioconductor.org/packages/2.11/bioc/vignettes/cummeRbund/inst/doc/cummeRbund-manual.pdf) to overview all possibilities!
