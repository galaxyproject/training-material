# Why visualization?

???
Data alone does not bring any information: to carry information, data needs to be contextualized. Transcriptomic data is no exception, therefore to organize the growing body of knowledge pertaining RNA-Seq experiments and infer valuable insights, data needs to be organized, annotated, and ultimately visualized.

### Where is my data coming from?

![Wang et al, Nat Rev Genet, 2009](../../images/transcriptomics_images/cummerbund-rna-seq-experiment.jpg)

???
- RNAs are converted into cDNA fragments through RNA fragmentation
- sequencing adaptors (in blue) are then added to each cDNA fragment
- cDNA sequences are obtained via NGS sequencing
- the obtained reads are subsequently aligned against a reference genome or transcriptome, and classified in-silico as exonic reads, junction reads, and poly-A reads
- these three types are then used to outline an expression profile for each gene

This is the process that will:

- reveal new genes and splice variants
- help quantifying cell-specific gene expression within the genome under study

But once this pipeline is implemented, how are sequence data going to be analysed and managed?

### Bioinformatic tools for RNA-Seq analysis

Once the RNA-Seq pipeline is implemented, we still need to handle and analyse all data that is generated. This requires:

- computer science skills to be handled

- mathematical knowledge to be interpreted

### Bioinformatic tools for RNA-Seq analysis

???
- first, reads from each condition are mapped to the reference genome using TopHat
- the resulting alignment files are given to Cufflinks, which generates a transcriptome assembly for each condition
- the two assemblies are then merged together to provides a uniform basis for calculating of gene and transcript expression in each condition
- both reads and merged assemblies are fed to CuffDiff, to calculate expression levels via statistical significance test for the observed changes

---

### Bioinformatic tools for RNA-Seq analysis

The last step in our RNA-Seq analysis is CuffDiff. Its output comprises multiple files containing the results of the differential expression analysis.

- Gene expression levels are reported as <i>tab-separated</i> values: a simple tabular output that can be viewed with any spreadsheet application. Such files contain statistics, gene-related, and transcript-related attributes
.image-75[![CuffDiff output](../../images/transcriptomics_images/cummerbund-cuffdiff-output.png)]

- Another way to collect all these data is to organize it within a dedicated database for later consultation. CuffDiff can be instructed to do so

???
- CuffDiff provides analyses of differential expression and regulation at the gene and transcript level
- its results are reported in a tab separated format
- the overall collection of data is difficult to read to obtain a bird's-eye view of the change of expression
- the data can be organized in a SQLite database

---

### Bioinformatic tools for RNA-Seq analysis

Whatever storage strategy you opted for, i.e. multiple tab-separated-value files or a SQLite database, all data is still retained within text format.

We need to have a bird's-eye view of that data, and <i>make sense</i> of it

# Visualization

---

### CummeRbund

[CummeRbund](http://compbio.mit.edu/cummeRbund/) is an R package for visualizing the results of a CuffDiff output.

- Manages, integrates, and visualizes all data produced by CuffDiff

- Simplifies data exploration

- Provides a bird's-eye view of the expression analysis

- Helps creating publication-ready plots

---

### CummeRbund

CummeRbund needs to be instructed on which data to be visualized:

- <i>Extract CuffDiff</i>'s "Transcript differential expression testing" table

- <i>Filter</i> the table on the column storing the significance of a differentially expressed gene

- <i>Sort</i> all entries on the basis of most significant differentially expressed gene

- Identify the most significant differentially expressed gene

### CummeRbund

Once the most significant differentially expressed gene has been identified, CummeRbund can generate publication-ready plots to highlight...

.image-50[![CummeRbund Expression plot](../../images/transcriptomics_images/cummerbund-expression-plot.png)]

The expression of all isoforms of the single gene with replicate FPKMs
