# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

RNA-Seq analysis helps researchers annotate new genes and splice variants, and provides cell- and context-specific quantification of gene expression. RNA-Seq data, however, are complex and require both computer science and mathematical knowledge to be managed and interpreted.

Visualization techniques are key to overcome the complexity of RNA-Seq data, and represent valuable tools to gather information and insights.

# Reasons for visualizing RNA-Seq results

To make sense of the available RNA-Seq data, and overview the condition-specific gene expression levels of the provided samples, we need to visualize our results. Here we will use [CummeRbund](http://compbio.mit.edu/cummeRbund/).

CummeRbund is an open-source tool that simplifies the analysis of a CuffDiff RNA-Seq output. In particular, it helps researchers:
- managing, integrating, and visualizing the data produced by CuffDiff
- simplifying data exploration
- providing a bird's-eye view of the expression analysis by describing relationships betweeen genes, transcripts, transcription start sites, and protein-coding regions
- exploring subfeatures of individual genes or gene-sets
- creating publication-ready plots

A typical workflow for the visualization of RNA-Seq data involving CummeRbund:

![workflow](../../images/cummerbund-rna-seq-viz-with-cummerbund.png)

CummeRbund reads your RNA-Seq results from a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database. This database has to be created using CuffDiff's SQLite output option.

CuffDiff's output data is organized in a SQLite database, so we need to extract it to be able to see what it looks like.

For this tutorial, we are interested in CuffDiff's tested transcripts for differential expression.

# Filtering and sorting

We now want to first highlight the most significant differentially expressed genes in our analysis, and then obtain informative visualizations.

# CummeRbund

With CummeRbund we can visualize our RNA-Seq results of interest.

CummeRbund generates always two outputs:
- the plot
- the R script responsible for generating the plot

We are interested in visualizing all expression values of all transcripts relative to the most significant differentially expressed gene we found in the previous section.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Visualization
>
> 1. **CummeRbund** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - Click on "Insert plot"
>   - "Width" and "Height" to `800x600`
>   - "Plot type" to `Expression Plot`
>   - "Expression levels to plot" to `Isoforms`
>   - "Gene ID" to `NDUFV1`
>   - Your input form parameters should look like the following. If so, click on "Execute"

{: .hands_on}

Our first CummeRbund plot is the "Expression Plot":

![Expression plot](../../images/cummerbund-expression-plot.png)

The Expression Plot represents the expression of all isoforms of a single gene (NDUFV1) with replicate FPKMs exposed.

Our plot has a modest number of isoforms, and is therefore already readable. However, in case of 5 or 6 isoforms, the plot can look very busy. We can therefore change the visualization type by selecting another type of plot.

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

Visualization tools help researchers making sense of data, providing a bird's-eye view of the underlying analysis results.
In this tutorial we overviewed the advantages of visualizing RNA-Seq results with CummeRbund, and gained insights on CuffDiff's big-data output by plotting informations relative to the most significant differentially expressed genes in our RNA-Seq analysis.
