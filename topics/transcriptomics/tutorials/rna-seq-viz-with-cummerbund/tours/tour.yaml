      In this tutorial we will visualize RNA-Seq results in order to make sense

  - title: Introduction
    content: >-
      RNA-Seq analysis helps researchers annotate new genes and splice variants,
      and provides cell- and context-specific quantification of gene expression.
      RNA-Seq data, however, are complex and require both computer science and
      mathematical knowledge to be managed and interpreted.
      <br><br>Visualization techniques are key to overcome the complexity of
      RNA-Seq data, and represent valuable tools to gather information and
      insights.

  - title: Reasons for visualizing RNA-Seq results
    content: >-
      To make sense of the available RNA-Seq data, and overview the
      condition-specific gene expression levels of the provided samples, we need
      to visualize our results. Here we will use <a
      href="http://compbio.mit.edu/cummeRbund/">CummeRbund</a>.

  - title: CummeRbund
    content: >-
      CummeRbund is an open-source tool that simplifies the analysis of a
      CuffDiff RNA-Seq output. In particular, it helps researchers:<ul>
        <li>managing, integrating, and visualizing the data produced by CuffDiff</li>
        <li>simplifying data exploration</li>
        <li>providing a bird’s-eye view of the expression analysis by describing relationships betweeen genes, transcripts, transcription start sites, and protein-coding regions</li>
        <li>exploring subfeatures of individual genes or gene-sets</li>
        <li>creating publication-ready plots</li></ul>
      CummeRbund reads your RNA-Seq results from a <a
      href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> database. This database has to
      be created using CuffDiff’s SQLite output option.

      Visualization tools help researchers making sense of data, providing a
      bird’s-eye view of the underlying analysis results. In this tutorial we
      overviewed the advantages of visualizing RNA-Seq results with CummeRbund,
      and gained insights on CuffDiff’s big-data output by plotting informations
      relative to the most significant differentially expressed genes in our
      RNA-Seq analysis.
