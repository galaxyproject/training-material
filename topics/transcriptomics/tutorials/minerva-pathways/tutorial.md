questions:
    - Which pathways are affected in this COVID-19 study?
    - How can I visualise the results of a differential expression analysis in the MINERVA Platform?
objectives:
    - Perform an analysis using a workflow from WorkflowHub
    - Visualise and interpret the results with MINERVA
time_estimation: 1h
key_points:
    - The MINERVA Platform is an excellent tool for visualising pathway analysis results
    - Several built-in maps are available such as the COVID-19 Disease Map which is pre-configured in all updated Galaxy servers.
    - You can use it to explore the expression patterns of genes in pathways relevant to your interests.

This tutorial is a partial reproduction of {% cite Togami_2022 %} wherein they evaluated mRNA and miRNA in a selection of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls.
While that paper uses a closed source pipeline, we'll be reproducing the analysis with open source tools in Galaxy, using a workflow on WorkflowHub developed for the BY-COVID project.

There are several places you can jump to in this tutorial, using pre-calculated
data. We recommend you jump skipping the data download and counting step, and
skipping to the analysis, as that precludes the slowest and most data intensive
parts of this tutorial. However, the entire process is documented in case you
want to reproduce our work.

## Analysis

We have split this workflow into three parts, based only on how long the first two portions of the workflow take to execute.
The rough runtime of the workflow portions, when this was being developed, can be broken down as follows:

Step                     | Time
---                      | ---
Data Download            | ~6h
Processing Counts        | ~8h
Analysis & Visualisation | 15m

These numbers were generated on UseGalaxy.eu and may not represent the most
efficient possible computation, as they are executed on a shared cluster that can, at times, be more or less busy.

As such we recommend you skip to the analysis step to progress to the interesting portion of the tutorial. We have provided in the Zenodo record data from the entire analysis,
analysed with the Download & Counts steps that can be skipped.

<div class="Download" markdown=1>

### Data Download

We'll start by downloading our FASTQ files from the [GEO Dataset GSE182152](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE182152)

> <hands-on-title>Download the data from GEO (ETA: 6 Hours)</hands-on-title>

>
> 1. **Run the workflow** with the following parameters:
>
>    - *"Sample Table"*: `factordata.tabular`
{: .hands_on}

Here we have cut the `SRR*` identifiers from the sample table and downloaded them with `fasterq`, part of the SRA toolkit.

### Counts

With that done, we can start to analyse the data using HISAT2 and featureCounts.
This workflow takes in the RNA Sequencing data we've downloaded previously, before trimming it with cutadapt.
Both the trimmed and untrimmed reads are run through FastQC for visualisation.

<figure>
{% assign wf_counts = site | get_workflow:page, "Galaxy-Workflow-mRNA-Seq_BY-COVID_Pipeline__Counts.ga" %}
<pre class="mermaid">
{{ wf_counts.mermaid }}
</pre>
<figcaption><b>Workflow 1</b>: Counts Workflow for mRNA-Seq BY-COVID Pipeline.</figcaption>
</figure>

The trimmed reads are then handled by HISAT2 for alignment to the reference
human genome, and featureCounts is run for quantification.

This workflow produces a set of featureCounts tables, a set of featureLengths (needed for goseq), and a MultiQC report.

{: .hands_on}

This workflow produces a handful of outputs: the featureCounts results, and a
MultiQC report. Looking at the report we see generally reasonable quality data.

Now we're ready to analyse the counts files. Here we'll take the feature counts dataset collection and merge it into one count matrix through the use of "Column join".
This can then be annotated with the human readable names of the genes. This is all passed to limma for differential expression analysis.

With this result in hand, we're ready to do two further steps: preparing the dataset for goseq, and for analysis in the MINERVA Platform.
Goseq is a tool for gene ontology enrichment analysis, and the MINERVA Platform is a tool for visualising pathway analysis.

>
{: .hands_on}

You should have a few outputs, namely the `goseq` outputs, and a table ready for visualisation in the MINERVA Platform!

## The MINERVA Platform

The dataset prepared for the MINERVA Platform must be correctly formatted as a tabular dataset (`\t` separated values) like the following, with the dbkey set to `hg19` or `hg38`.
If you've run the above workflow, this should be the case.

```

```

The tabular dataset, as prepared above is then used by a dedicated MINERVA plugin ({% cite hoksza_minerva_2019 %}) to visualise the data on-the-fly in the [COVID-19 Disease Map](https://covid19map.elixir-luxembourg.org/minerva/). To visualise and explore the data, follow these steps:

### Analysis in the MINERVA Platform

Welcome to the MINERVA Covid-19 Disease Map! It has a similar interface to Galaxy, there is an interaction menu on the left, the main area is where you'll do your investigation,
and on the right are your datasets! In this case, the differentially expressed genes analysed above automatically loaded from Galaxy when you clicked "Display at MINERVA".

![MINERVA main view, a search menu on the left, a view of the disease map in the center showing a colourful cell diagram with signalling and T-Cells and CD8+ and more. On the right is a filtering box for the dataset from Galaxy allowing the user to filter by p-value and FC thresholds. 397 genes have been loaded.](images/3.png)

After the loading time, marked as "Reading Map Elements", the dataset will be visible in the right panel of the COVID-19 Disease Map, with the four corresponding columns specified earlier (see image below). The MINERVA-Galaxy plugin allows you to:

- filter the data table by fold-change (FC) threshold or by p-value (default: adjusted p-value, threshold set to 0.05)
- Search for specific gene symbols to display ("Search" box)
- Select specific differential expression values to display in the map (checkboxes in the data tab)
- Select all entries in the data table for visualisation (Select All)
- Reset the visualisation

The general process of data exploration looks like:

1. In the main map, find pathways with matching entries indicated by blue pins.
1. After selecting what you want to see, browse the COVID-19 Disease Map to explore the pathways with the corresponding expression pattern.
1. Select a pathway of your choice and in the left panel click the "Associated submap" button
1. Explore the expression patterns in the diagram that will be displayed.

> <hands-on-title>Explore TLR pathways</hands-on-title>

> 1. Use the **Search** box above the table on the right to search for **TLR**.
> 2. Select all four TLR genes.
>
>    - TLR3

>    - TLR8
