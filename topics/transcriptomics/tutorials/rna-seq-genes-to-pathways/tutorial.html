                <p>Sometimes there is quite a long list of genes to interpret after a differential expression analysis, and it is usually infeasible to go through the list one gene at a time trying to understand it’s biological function. A common downstream procedure is gene set testing, which aims to understand which pathways/gene networks the differentially expressed genes are implicated in. There are many different gene set testing methods that can be applied and it can be useful to try several.</p>

<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to perform gene set testing using tools in Galaxy. The data comes from a Nature Cell Biology paper, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25730472">EGF-mediated induction of Mcl-1 at the switch to lactation is essential for alveolar cell survival</a>), Fu et al. 2015. That study examined the expression profiles of basal and luminal cells in the mammary gland of virgin, pregnant and lactating mice (see Figure below). How to generate differentially expressed genes from reads (FASTQs) for this dataset is covered in the accompanying tutorials <a href="/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/rna-seq-reads-to-counts/tutorial.html">RNA-seq reads to counts</a> and <a href="/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/rna-seq-counts-to-genes/tutorial.html">RNA-seq counts to genes</a>. This tutorial is inspired by material from the COMBINE R RNAseq workshop <a href="http://combine-australia.github.io/RNAseq-R/06-rnaseq-day1.html">here</a> and the Cancer Research UK workshop <a href="https://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/cruk-summer-school-2018/RNASeq2018/html/06_Gene_set_testing.nb.html">here</a>.</p>

This is shown on the left side of the figure. It is hard to trace which datasets contain “plus” data versus “minus” data. For example, does dataset 10 contain “plus” data or “minus” data? Probably “minus” but are you sure? In the case of a small history like the one shown here, it is possible to trace this manually but as the size of a history grows it will become very challenging.</p>   <p>The right side of the figure shows exactly the same analysis, but using name tags. When the analysis was conducted datasets 4 and 5 were tagged with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#plus</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#minus</code>, respectively. When they were used as inputs to Macs2 resulting datasets 6 and 8 automatically inherited them and so on… As a result it is straightforward to trace both branches (plus and minus) of this analysis.</p>   <p>More information is in a <a href="/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/name-tags/tutorial.html">dedicated #nametag tutorial</a>.</p>   <!-- Image is here = https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1iiNsau6ddiE2MV9qMyekUq2mrpDHHcc02bXtcFEAnhY/edit?usp=sharing --> </blockquote>

<h1 id="gene-set-testing">Gene Set Testing</h1>

<h2 id="gene-ontology-testing-with-goseq">Gene Ontology testing with <strong>goseq</strong></h2>

<p>We would like to know if there are biological categories that are enriched among the differentially expressed genes. To do this we will perform a Gene Ontology analysis, similar to the <a href="/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/ref-based/tutorial.html">RNA-seq ref-based tutorial</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.geneontology.org/">Gene Ontology (GO)</a> analysis is widely used to reduce complexity and highlight biological processes in genome-wide expression studies. However, standard methods give biased results on RNA-seq data due to over-detection of differential expression for long and highly-expressed transcripts.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/goseq/inst/doc/goseq.pdf">goseq tool</a> provides methods for performing GO analysis of RNA-seq data, taking length bias into account. The methods and software used by goseq are equally applicable to other category based tests of RNA-seq data, such as KEGG pathway analysis.</p>

<p>goseq needs 2 files as inputs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a <strong>differentially expressed genes</strong> file. Information for all genes tested for differential expression (all genes after filtering lowly expressed). This file should have 2 columns:
    <ul>
      <li>the Gene IDs (unique within the file)</li>
      <li>True (differentially expressed) or False (not differentially expressed)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>a <strong>gene lengths</strong> file. Information to correct for potential length bias in differentially expressed genes. This file should have 2 columns:
    <ul>
      <li>the Gene IDs (unique within the file)</li>
      <li>the gene lengths</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We need a table of differentially expressed (DE) results for goseq. Here we will use two tables, one for each of the basal and luminal pregnant vs lactate results. This is so we can compare results for the two cell types. These tables were output from the limma-voom tool but DE tables from edgeR or DESeq2 could also be used. For this dataset we will call genes differentially expressed if they have an adjusted P value below 0.01. We can use the gene lengths from the counts table in GEO (provided as a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">seqdata</code> in Zenodo). But if we didn’t have that we could use a tool like <strong>featureCounts</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">tool</span> to output a gene lengths file. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">seqdata</code> file contains &gt;20k genes, but we only want the ~15k we have in our differentially expressed genes file. So we will join the lengths file with the differentially expressed genes file, keeping only the length information for genes present in the differentially expressed genes file. We can then cut out the columns we need for the two inputs (gene id, length) (gene id, DE status) and as a bonus they will both be sorted in the same order, which is what we need for goseq.</p>

<p>To generate the two input files we will use:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Compute</strong> to add a column to the DE tables, that gives genes meeting our adj.P threshold the value “True” and all other genes the value “False”.</li>
  <li><strong>Join two Datasets</strong> to add the gene length information to the differentially expressed genes, matching on gene ids</li>
  <li><strong>Cut</strong> to extract the two columns for the differentially expressed genes information</li>
  <li><strong>Cut</strong> to extract the two columns for the gene length information</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gene-set-enrichment-analysis-with-fgsea">Gene Set Enrichment Analysis with <strong>fgsea</strong></h2>

<p>Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16199517">(Subramanian et al., 2005)</a> is a widely used method that determines whether a set of genes is enriched in a list of differentially expressed genes. Unlike the previous method with goseq, no threshold is applied for what is considered “differentially expressed”, all genes are used. If a gene set falls at either the top (over-expressed) or bottom (under-expressed) of the list it is said to be enriched. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/20/060012">fgsea</a> is a faster implementation of the GSEA method. fgsea requires a ranked list of genes and some gene sets to test.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp">Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)</a> contains curated collections of gene sets that are commonly used in a GSEA analysis. They can be downloaded from the <a href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/downloads.jsp">Broad website</a>. But these collections are only of human gene sets. If working with another species you would need to first map the genes to their human orthologues. However, MSigDB versions for mouse are provided <a href="http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/MSigDB/index.html">by the Smyth lab here</a>. There are several MSigDB collections, we’ll use the <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/fulltext/S2405-4712(15)00218-5">Hallmark collection</a>, which contains 50 gene sets. According to MSigDB, “each gene set in the hallmark collection consists of a “refined” gene set, derived from multiple “founder” sets, that conveys a specific biological state or process and displays coherent expression. The hallmarks effectively summarize most of the relevant information of the original founder sets and, by reducing both variation and redundancy, provide more refined and concise inputs for gene set enrichment analysis”.  We’ll use the mouse Hallmark file provided in Zenodo, originally downloaded from http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/MSigDB/mouse_H_v5p2.rdata.</p>

<p>There are several ways we could choose to rank our genes, we could rank by log-fold change (most upregulated to most downregulated) but that doesn’t take into account any error in the log fold change value. Another way is to use the “signed fold change” which is to rank by the sign of the fold change multiplied by the P value (as described <a href="http://genomespot.blogspot.com/2014/09/data-analysis-step-8-pathway-analysis.html">here</a>. We could also use the t statistic that’s output from limma, as that takes into account the log-fold change and it’s standard error, see <a href="https://support.bioconductor.org/p/6124/">here</a> for more explanation. We’ll use the t statistic to rank here.</p>

<p>An enrichment plot of the each of the top pathways can also be produced, one is shown below. The barcode pattern shows where the genes in the set are found in the list of ranked genes. Most of the bars to the left indicate enrichment of the set at the top of the ranked list of genes (upregulated) and most bars towards the right indicate enrichment at the bottom of the list (downregulated). The enrichment score reflects the degree to which the genes are enriched at the top or bottom of the list.</p>

<h2 id="ensemble-gene-set-enrichment-analyses-with-egsea">Ensemble gene set enrichment analyses with <strong>EGSEA</strong></h2>

<p>The ensemble of genes set enrichment analyses (EGSEA) <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27694195">(Alhamdoosh et al, 2017)</a> is a method developed for RNA-seq data that combines results from multiple algorithms and calculates collective gene set scores, to try to improve the biological relevance of the highest ranked gene sets. EGSEA has built-in gene sets from MSigDB and KEGG for human and mouse. We’ll show here how it can be used with the MSigDB Hallmark collection and KEGG pathways. For input we need a count matrix and EGSEA will perform a limma-voom analysis before gene set testing. We can use the provided filtered counts file output from limma, where the low count genes have been filtered out (output from limma by selecting <em>“Output Filtered Counts Table?”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Yes</code>). We just need to remove the gene symbol and description columns. We also need a symbols mapping file containing just the Entrez ids and symbols, which we can generate from the filtered counts file. The third input we need is a factors information file, containing what groups the samples belong to, we can use the same one from the tutorial <a href="/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/rna-seq-counts-to-genes/tutorial.html">RNA-seq counts to genes</a>. EGSEA provides twelve base methods and we will select eleven, all except roast, as the fry method is a fast approximation of roast.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In this tutorial we have seen some gene set testing methods that can be used to interpret lists of differentially expressed genes. Multiple methods can be used to help identify pathways of interest and to provide complementary ways of visualising results. This follows on from the accompanying tutorials, <a href="/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/rna-seq-reads-to-counts/tutorial.html">RNA-seq reads to counts</a> and <a href="/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/rna-seq-counts-to-genes/tutorial.html">RNA-seq counts to genes</a>, that showed how to turn reads (FASTQs) into differentially expressed genes for this dataset. For further reading on analysis of RNA-seq count data and the methods used here, see the articles; RNA-seq analysis is easy as 1-2-3 with limma, Glimma and edgeR <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/5-1408/v2">(Law et al. 2016)</a> and From reads to genes to pathways: differential expression analysis of RNA-Seq experiments using Rsubread and the edgeR quasi-likelihood pipeline <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/5-1438/v2">(Chen, Lun, Smyth 2016)</a>.</p>

					<b>Disliked</b>: I'd like to see more discussion of what to make of these gene and process lists.  The first go method came up with categories such as "cell"  what to make of this?  Also - the gene lists identified in these tutorials does not match that of the Fu paper.  Probably because a smaller data set was used ?
