### Barcoding Cells

### Filtering: Cell and Gene

### Normalisation: Technical Variation

![fig3](../../images/raceid_technical_variation.svg)

---

### Normalisation: Biological Variation


![fig4](../../images/raceid_cellcycle.svg)

---

### Dimension Reduction: Relatedness of Cells

![fig5](../../images/scrna_knn.svg)


???
Build a KNN graph from distance matrix:
  * If P and q share distance which is 

---

### Dimension Reduction: Projection

![fig6](../../images/raceid_dimred.svg)

???
- Can use tSNE, PCA, UMAP

---

### Community Clustering: Louvain

Aim: Maximise internal links and minimise external links

![fig7](../../images/commgraph1.svg)


---

### Community Clustering: Louvain

Pick a cell, place in neighbour, and accept if *internal:external* increases

### Cell Type: Identifying Cluster Types

### Clustering: Hard vs Soft

.pull-left[

<br />

.image-100[![fig11](../../images/singlecellplot3.png)]

*Hard*
  * Big spaces between clusters
  * Cell types are well defined and the clustering reflects that

]

--

.pull-right[
.image-100[![fig12](../../images/10xdata.png)]

*Soft*
  * Clusters bleed into one another
  * Cell types seem to intermingle with one another.

]

???
Why? Why would there be clusters so close to one another?

---

### Continuous Phenotypes:

.image-100[![fig13](../../images/raceid_contpheno.svg)]

???
* Cells aren't discrete, they transition

* Continuously changing over time from a less mature type to more mature type

What is Differential Expression in scRNA-seq?

---

### CellxGene Local Test

* We can probe clusters to see how they are so differentially expressed

        pip3 install cellxgene
        cellxgene launch https://cellxgene-example-data.czi.technology/pbmc3k.h5ad

* Launch locally: http://127.0.0.1:5005
