    questions:
      - What genes are differentially expressed between G1E cells and megakaryocytes?
      - How can we generate a transcriptome de novo from RNA sequencing data?
    objectives:
      - Analysis of RNA sequencing data using a reference genome
      - Reconstruction of transcripts without reference transcriptome (de novo)

    key_points:
      - De novo transcriptome reconstruction is the ideal approach for identifying
        differentially expressed known and novel transcripts.
      - Differential gene expression testing is improved with the use of replicate
        experiments and deep sequence coverage.
      - Visualizing data on a genome browser is a great way to display interesting
        patterns of differential expression.

    questions:
      - What small RNAs are expressed?
      - What RNA features have significantly different numbers of small RNAs targeting
        them between two conditions?
    objectives:
      - Process small RNA-seq datasets to determine quality and reproducibility.
      - Filter out contaminants (e.g. rRNA reads) in small RNA-seq datasets.
      - Differentiate between subclasses of small RNAs based on their characteristics.
      - Identify differently abundant small RNAs and their targets.
    time_estimation: 3h
    key_points:
      - Analysis of small RNAs is complex due to the diversity of small RNA subclasses.
      - Both alignment to references and transcript quantification approaches are
        useful for small RNA-seq analyses.
