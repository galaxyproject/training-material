  questions:
  - What genes are differentially expressed between G1E cells and megakaryocytes?
  - How can we generate a transcriptome de novo from RNA sequencing data?
  objectives:
  - Analysis of RNA sequencing data using a reference genome
  - Reconstruction of transcripts without reference transcriptome (de novo)
  - Analysis of differentially expressed genes

  key_points:
  - De novo transcriptome reconstruction is the ideal approach for identifying differentially
    expressed known and novel transcripts.
  - Differential gene expression testing is improved with the use of replicate experiments
    and deep sequence coverage.
  - Visualizing data on a genome browser is a great way to display interesting patterns
    of differential expression.

- title: Differential abundance testing of small RNAs
  type: tutorial
  name: srna
  zenodo_link: https://zenodo.org/record/826906
  galaxy_tour: false
  hands_on: true
  slides: false
  workflows: true
  questions:
  - What small RNAs are expressed?
  - What RNA features have significantly different numbers of small RNAs targeting
    them between two conditions?
  objectives:
  - Process small RNA-seq datasets to determine quality and reproducibility.
  - Filter out contaminants (e.g. rRNA reads) in small RNA-seq datasets.
  - Differentiate between subclasses of small RNAs based on their characteristics.
  - Identify differently abundant small RNAs and their targets.
  time_estimation: 3h
  key_points:
  - Analysis of small RNAs is complex due to the diversity of small RNA subclasses.
  - Both alignment to references and transcript quantification approaches are useful
    for small RNA-seq analyses.

- title: CLIP-Seq data analysis from pre-processing to motif detection
  name: clipseq
  type: tutorial
  zenodo_link: https://zenodo.org/record/1327423
  hands_on: true
  slides: false
  workflows: true
  galaxy_tour: false
  questions:
  - How is raw CLIP-Seq data processed and analysed?
  - How do I find binding motifs and targets for a protein (e.g., RBFOX2)?
  objectives:
  - Remove Adapters, Barcodes and Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) from the reads
  - Align trimmed reads with STAR
  - De-duplicate the read library
  - Inspect the read mapping and de-duplication quality
  - Perform peak calling with PEAKachu
  - Analyse the peaks and find potential binding motifs and targets
  - Check the quality of the peak calling
  time_estimation: 6h
  key_points:
  - Sophisticated analysis of CLIP-Seq data is possible using tools hosted by Galaxy.
  - Analysis of the datasets needs multiple methods to assess the quality of the data and to answer the biological question of interest.
  - CLIP-Seq data varies from protocol to protocol, thus flexible changes to the data anylsis are required which is supported by Galaxy.
  - By using the sharable and transparent Galaxy platform, data analyses can easily be shared and reproduced.
