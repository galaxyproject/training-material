- title: Differential abundance testing of small RNAs
  type: tutorial
  name: srna
  zenodo_link: https://zenodo.org/record/826906
  galaxy_tour: false
  hands_on: true
  slides: false
  workflows: true
  questions:
  - What small RNAs are expressed?
  - What RNA features have significantly different numbers of small RNAs targeting
    them between two conditions?
  objectives:
  - Process small RNA-seq datasets to determine quality and reproducibility.
  - Filter out contaminants (e.g. rRNA reads) in small RNA-seq datasets.
  - Differentiate between subclasses of small RNAs based on their characteristics.
  - Identify differently abundant small RNAs and their targets.
  time_estimation: 3h
  key_points:
  - Analysis of small RNAs is complex due to the diversity of small RNA subclasses.
  - Both alignment to references and transcript quantification approaches are useful
    for small RNA-seq analyses.

  type: tutorial
  zenodo_link: https://zenodo.org/record/1345635
  hands_on: true
  slides: false
  workflows: true
  galaxy_tour: false
  questions:
    - How do we separate reads from seperate cells?
    - How do we reduce PCR bias?
    - How do we verify a barcode format?
    - How do we check for cross-contamination?
  objectives:
    - Demultiplex FASTQ data via UMI-tools
    - Understand and validate the extraction of UMIs and Cell-Barcodes
    - Obtain an overview of general alignment and quantification techniques
    - Generate a count matrix for downstream scRNA analysis
  time_estimation: 1h
  key_points:
    - Verifying the distribution of barcodes via a FASTQC plot
    - Relocating barcodes into headers
    - Merging matrices from different batches together
    - Removing unwanted barcodes

- title: CLIP-Seq data analysis from pre-processing to motif detection
  name: clipseq
  type: tutorial
  zenodo_link: https://zenodo.org/record/1327423
  hands_on: true
  slides: false
  workflows: true
  galaxy_tour: false
  questions:
  - How is raw CLIP-Seq data processed and analysed?
  - How do I find binding motifs and targets for a protein (e.g., RBFOX2)?
  objectives:
  - Remove Adapters, Barcodes and Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) from the reads
  - Align trimmed reads with STAR
  - De-duplicate the read library
  - Inspect the read mapping and de-duplication quality
  - Perform peak calling with PEAKachu
  - Analyse the peaks and find potential binding motifs and targets
  - Check the quality of the peak calling
  time_estimation: 6h
  key_points:
  - Sophisticated analysis of CLIP-Seq data is possible using tools hosted by Galaxy.
  - Analysis of the datasets needs multiple methods to assess the quality of the data and to answer the biological question of interest.
  - CLIP-Seq data varies from protocol to protocol, thus flexible changes to the data anylsis are required which is supported by Galaxy.
  - By using the sharable and transparent Galaxy platform, data analyses can easily be shared and reproduced.
