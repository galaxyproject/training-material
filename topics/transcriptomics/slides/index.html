# What is RNA sequencing?

---

### RNA

![The structure of a eukaryotic protein-coding gene](../images/Gene_structure_eukaryote_2_annotated.png)

- Transcribed form of the DNA
- Active state of the DNA

## RNA sequencing

![Summary of RNA-Seq principle](../images/Summary_of_RNA-Seq.png)

- RNA quantification at single base resolution
- Cost efficient analysis of the whole transcriptome in a high-throughput manner

---

### Challenges of RNA sequencing

- Different origin for the sample RNA and the reference genome
- Presence of incompletely processed RNAs or transcriptional background noise
- Sequencing biases (*e.g.* PCR library preparation)

---

### Benefits of RNA sequencing

![](../images/wordcloud.png)

---

### 2 main research applications for RNA-Seq

- Transcript discovery

    > *Which RNA molecules are in my sample?*

    > Novel isoforms and alternative splicing, Non-coding RNAs, Single nucleotide variations, Fusion genes

- RNA quantification

    > *What is the concentration of RNAs?*

    > Absolute gene expression (within sample), Differential expression (between biological samples)

## How to analyze RNA seq data for RNA quantification?

### Overview of the Data Processing

![](../images/rna_seq_workflow.png)

- No available standardized workflow
- Multiple possible best practices for every dataset

---

### Data Pre-processing

1. Adapter clipping to trim the sequencing adapters
2. Quality trimming to remove wrongly called and low quality bases

.footnote[See [NGS Quality control](../../NGS-QC/slides/index.html)]

---

### Annotation of RNA-Seq reads

Simple mapping on a reference genome? More challenging

---

### Annotation of RNA-Seq reads

3 main strategies for annotations

- Transcriptome mapping
- Genome mapping
- *De novo* transcriptome assembly and annotation

---

### Transcriptome mapping

![](../images/transcriptome_alignment.png)

*See [NGS Mapping](../../NGS-mapping/slides/index.html)*

- Need reliable gene models
- No detection of novel genes

.footnote[Figures by Ernest Turro, EMBO Practical Course on Analysis of HTS Data, 2012]

---

### Genome mapping

Splice-aware read alignment

![](../images/genome_alignment.png)

Detection of novel genes and isoforms

.footnote[Figures by Ernest Turro, EMBO Practical Course on Analysis of HTS Data, 2012]

---

### Transcriptome and Genome mapping

Needed

- Reference genome/transcriptome in FASTA
- Annotations of known genes, ... in GTF

Where to find?

- Joint projects to produce and maintain annotations on selected organisms: EMBL-EBI, UCSC, RefSeq, Ensembl, ...

---

### *De novo* transcriptome assembly

No need for a reference genome ...

1. Assembly into transcripts
2. Map reads back

---

### Quantification

*What is the expression level of the genomic features?*

- Counting the number of reads per features: Easy!!
- Challenges
    - How to handle multi-mapped reads (*i.e.* reads with multiple alignments)?
    - How to distinguish between different isoforms?
        - At gene level?
        - At transcript level?
        - At exon level?

---

### Differential Expression Analysis

.image-75[![](../images/RNA_seq_DEscheme.png)]

Account for variability of expression across biological replicates<br>with the help of counts

---

### Differential Expression Analysis: Normalization

*Make the expression levels comparable across*

- By Features: genes, isoforms
- By Samples
- Methods
    - [*FPKM/RPKM*](https://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v5/n7/abs/nmeth.1226.html) (Cufflinks/Cuffdiff)
    - [*TMM*](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2010-11-3-r25) (edgeR)
    - [*DESeq2*](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8) (DESeq2)

        Normalize counts *k<sub>ij</sub>* for gene *i* in library *j* by size factor *s<sub>j</sub>*

.footnote[*"Only the DESeq and TMM normalization methods are robust to the presence of different library sizes and widely different library compositions..."* - Dillies et al., Brief Bioinf, 2013]

### Impact of sequencing depth and number of replicates

.image-50[![](../images/RNA_seq_numreplicates.png)]

.footnote[[*Conesa et al, Genome Biol, 2016*](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0881-8)]

**Recommendation: At least 3 biological replicates**

???

- Number of replicates has greater effect on DE detection accuracy than sequencing depth (more replicates = increased statistical power)
- DE detection of lowly expressed genes is very sensitive to number of reads and replication
- DE detection of highly expressed genes possible already at low sequencing depth
