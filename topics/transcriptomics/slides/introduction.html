  ## Requirements

  Before diving into this slide deck, we recommend you to have a look at:

  
    
  - [Galaxy introduction](/training-material/topics//introduction/)
    
  
    
  - [Quality control](/training-material/topics//sequence-analysis/)

# What is RNA sequencing?

---

### RNA

![The structure of a eukaryotic protein-coding gene](../images/Gene_structure_eukaryote_2_annotated.png)

- Transcribed form of the DNA
- Active state of the DNA

.footnote[[Credit: Thomas Shafee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gene_structure_eukaryote_2_annotated.svg)]

---

## RNA sequencing

![Summary of RNA-Seq principle](../images/Summary_of_RNA-Seq.png)

- RNA quantification at single base resolution
- Cost efficient analysis of the whole transcriptome in a high-throughput manner

.footnote[[Credit: Thomas Shafee (adapted)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Summary_of_RNA-Seq.svg)]

---

### Where does my data come from?

### Principle of RNA sequencing

.footnote[[*Korf, Nat Met, 2013*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4461013/)]

---

### Challenges of RNA sequencing

- Different origin for the sample RNA and the reference genome
- Presence of incompletely processed RNAs or transcriptional background noise
- Sequencing biases (*e.g.* PCR library preparation)

---

### Benefits of RNA sequencing

![](../images/wordcloud.png)

---

### 2 main research applications for RNA-Seq

- Transcript discovery

    &gt; *Which RNA molecules are in my sample?*

    &gt; Novel isoforms and alternative splicing, Non-coding RNAs, Single nucleotide variations, Fusion genes

- RNA quantification

    &gt; *What is the concentration of RNAs?*

    &gt; Absolute gene expression (within sample), Differential expression (between biological samples)

---

## How to analyze RNA seq data for RNA quantification?

---

### RNA quantification

.footnote[[*Pepke et al, Nat Met, 2009*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4077321/)]

---

### Overview of the Data Processing

![](../images/rna_seq_workflow.png)

- No available standardized workflow
- Multiple possible best practices for every dataset

---

### Data Pre-processing

1. Adapter clipping to trim the sequencing adapters
2. Quality trimming to remove wrongly called and low quality bases

.footnote[See [NGS Quality control](../../NGS-QC/slides/index.html)]

---

### Annotation of RNA-Seq reads

Simple mapping on a reference genome? More challenging

![](../images/RNA-Seq-alignment.png)

.footnote[[Credit: Rgocs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RNA-Seq-alignment.png)]

---

### Annotation of RNA-Seq reads

3 main strategies for annotations

- Transcriptome mapping
- Genome mapping
- *De novo* transcriptome assembly and annotation

---

### Transcriptome mapping

![](../images/transcriptome_alignment.png)

*See [NGS Mapping](../../NGS-mapping/slides/index.html)*

- Need reliable gene models
- No detection of novel genes

.footnote[Figures by Ernest Turro, EMBO Practical Course on Analysis of HTS Data, 2012]

---

### Genome mapping

Splice-aware read alignment

![](../images/genome_alignment.png)

Detection of novel genes and isoforms

.footnote[Figures by Ernest Turro, EMBO Practical Course on Analysis of HTS Data, 2012]

---

### Transcriptome and Genome mapping

Needed

- Reference genome/transcriptome in FASTA
- Annotations of known genes, ... in GTF

Where to find?

- Joint projects to produce and maintain annotations on selected organisms: EMBL-EBI, UCSC, RefSeq, Ensembl, ...

---

### *De novo* transcriptome assembly

No need for a reference genome ...

1. Assembly into transcripts
2. Map reads back

---

### Quantification

*What is the expression level of the genomic features?*

- Counting the number of reads per features: Easy!!
- Challenges
    - How to handle multi-mapped reads (*i.e.* reads with multiple alignments)?
    - How to distinguish between different isoforms?
        - At gene level?
        - At transcript level?
        - At exon level?

---

### Differential Expression Analysis

.image-75[![](../images/RNA_seq_DEscheme.png)]

Account for variability of expression across biological replicates&lt;br&gt;with the help of counts

---

### Differential Expression Analysis: Normalization

*Make the expression levels comparable across*

- By Features: genes, isoforms
- By Samples
- Methods
    - [*FPKM/RPKM*](https://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v5/n7/abs/nmeth.1226.html) (Cufflinks/Cuffdiff)
    - [*TMM*](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2010-11-3-r25) (edgeR)
    - [*DESeq2*](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8) (DESeq2)

        Normalize counts *k&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;* for gene *i* in library *j* by size factor *s&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;*

.footnote[*&quot;Only the DESeq and TMM normalization methods are robust to the presence of different library sizes and widely different library compositions...&quot;* - Dillies et al., Brief Bioinf, 2013]

---

### Impact of sequencing depth and number of replicates

.image-50[![](../images/RNA_seq_numreplicates.png)]

.footnote[[*Conesa et al, Genome Biol, 2016*](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0881-8)]

**Recommendation: At least 3 biological replicates**

???

- Number of replicates has greater effect on DE detection accuracy than sequencing depth (more replicates = increased statistical power)
- DE detection of lowly expressed genes is very sensitive to number of reads and replication
- DE detection of highly expressed genes possible already at low sequencing depth

---

### Visualization

- Integrative Genomics Viewer ([*IGV*](https://bib.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/2/178.full?keytype=ref&amp;%2520ijkey=qTgjFwbRBAzRZWC)) or Trackster

    Visualization of the aligned BAM files

- [*Sashimi plots*](https://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/01/21/bioinformatics.btv034)

    Quantitative visualization of read coverage along exons and splice junctions

- [*CummeRbund*](http://compbio.mit.edu/cummeRbund/manual_2_0.html)

    Visualization package for Cufflinks high-throughput sequencing data
