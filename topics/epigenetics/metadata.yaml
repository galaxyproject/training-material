    questions:
      - "What is methylation and why it cannot be recognised by a normal NGS procedure?"
      - "Can a different methylation influence the expression of a gene? How?"
      - "Which tools you can use to analyse methylation data?"
    objectives:
      - "Learn how to analyse methylation data"
      - "Get a first intuition what are common pitfalls."
    time_estimation: "3h"
    key_points:
      - "The output of a methylation NGS is having a different distribution of the four bases. This is caused by the bisulfite treatment of the DNA."
      - "If there is a different level of methylation in the loci of a gene this can be a hint that something is wrong."
      - "To get useful results you need -- data, data and data!"
