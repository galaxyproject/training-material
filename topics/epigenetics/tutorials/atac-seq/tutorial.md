# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

In many eukaryotic organisms, such as humans, the genome is tightly packed and organized with the help of nucleosomes (chromatin). A nucleosome is a complex formed by eight histone proteins that is wrapped with ~147bp of DNA. When the DNA is being actively transcribed into RNA, the DNA will be opened and loosened from the nucleosome complex. Many factors, such as the chromatin structure, the position of the nucleosomes, and histone modifications, play an important role in the organization and accessibility of the DNA. Consequently, these factors are also important for the activation and inactivation of genes. **A**ssay for **T**ransposase-**A**ccessible **C**hromatin using **seq**uencing ([ATAC-Seq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATAC-seq)) is a method to investigate the accessibility of chromatin and thus a method to determine regulatory mechanisms of gene expression. The method can help identify promoter regions and potential enhancers and silencers. A promoter is the DNA region close to the transcription start site (TSS). It contains binding sites for transcription factors that will recruit the RNA polymerase. An enhancer is a DNA region that can be located up to 1 Mb downstream or upstream of the promoter. When transcription factors bind an enhancer and contact a promoter region, the transcription of the gene is increased. In contrast, a silencer decreases or inhibits the gene's expression. ATAC-Seq has become popular for identifying accessible regions of the genome as it's easier, faster and requires less cells than alternative techniques, such as FAIRE-Seq and DNase-Seq.

![ATAC-Seq](../../images/atac-seq/atac-seq.jpeg "Buenrostro et al. 2013 Nat Methods")

With ATAC-Seq, to find accessible (open) chromatin regions, the genome is treated with a hyperactive derivative of the Tn5 transposase. A [transposase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposase) can bind to a [transposable element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposable_element), which is a DNA sequence that can change its position (jump) within a genome (read the two links to get a deeper insight). During ATAC-Seq, the modified Tn5 inserts DNA sequences corresponding to truncated Nextera adapters into open regions of the genome and concurrently, the DNA is sheared by the transposase activity. The read library is then prepared for sequencing, including PCR amplification with full Nextera adapters and purification steps. Paired-end reads are recommended for ATAC-Seq for the reasons described [here](https://informatics.fas.harvard.edu/atac-seq-guidelines.html).

In this tutorial we will use data from the study of {% cite Buenrostro2013 %}, the first paper on the ATAC-Seq method. The data is from a human cell line of purified CD4+ T cells, called GM12878. The original dataset had 2 x 200 million reads and would be too big to process in a training session, so we downsampled the original dataset to 200,000 randomly selected reads. We also added about 200,000 reads pairs that will map to chromosome 22 to have a good profile on this chromosome, similar to what you might get with a typical ATAC-Seq sample (2 x 20 million reads in original FASTQ). Furthermore, we want to compare the predicted open chromatin regions to the known binding sites of CTCF, a DNA-binding protein implicated in 3D structure: [CTCF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTCF). CTCF is known to bind to thousands of sites in the genome and thus it can be used as a positive control for assessing if the ATAC-Seq experiment is good quality. Good ATAC-Seq data would have accessible regions both within and outside of TSS, for example, at some CTCF binding sites. For that reason, we will download binding sites of CTCF identified by ChIP in the same cell line from ENCODE (ENCSR000AKB, dataset ENCFF933NTR).

### When working with real data
{:.no_toc}
When you use your own data we suggest you to use [this workflow](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/ldelisle/w/atac-seq-gtm-with-control-and-macs2) which includes the same steps but is compatible with replicates. If you do not have any control data you can import and edit this workflow, removing all steps with the controls. Controls for the ATAC-Seq procedure are not commonly performed, as discussed [here](https://informatics.fas.harvard.edu/atac-seq-guidelines.html), but could be ATAC-Seq of purified DNA.

# Preprocessing

## Get Data

We first need to download the sequenced reads (FASTQs) as well as other annotation files. Then, to increase the number of reads that will map to the reference genome (here human genome version 38, GRCh38/hg38), we need to preprocess the reads.

## Quality Control

The first step is to check the quality of the reads and the presence of the Nextera adapters. When we perform ATAC-Seq, we can get DNA fragments of about 40 bp if two adjacent Tn5 transposases cut the DNA {% cite Adey2010 %}. This can be smaller than the sequencing length so we expect to have Nextera adapters at the end of those reads. We can assess the reads with **FastQC**.

{: .comment}

The FastQC web page **Adapter Content** section shows the presence of Nextera Transposase Sequence in the reads. We will remove the adapters with Cutadapt.

## Trimming Reads

To trim the adapters we provide the Nextera adapter sequences to **Cutadapt**. These adapters are shown in the image below.

![Nextera library with the sequence of adapters](../../images/atac-seq/nexteraLibraryPicture.svg.png "Nextera library with the sequence of adapters")

The forward and reverse adapters are slightly different. We will also trim low quality bases at the ends of the reads (quality less than 20). We will only keep reads that are at least 20 bases long. We remove short reads (< 20bp) as they are not useful, they will either be thrown out by the mapping or may interfere with our results at the end.

# Mapping

## Mapping Reads to Reference Genome

Next we map the trimmed reads to the human reference genome. Here we will use **Bowtie2**. We will extend the maximum fragment length (distance between read pairs) from 500 to 1000 because we know some valid read pairs are from this fragment length. We will use the `--very-sensitive` parameter to have more chance to get the best match even if it takes a bit longer to run. We will run the **end-to-end** mode because we trimmed the adapters so we expect the whole read to map, no clipping of ends is needed. Regarding the genome to choose. The hg38 version of the human genome contains [alternate loci](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc/help/definitions/#ALTERNATE). This means that some region of the genome are present both in the canonical chromosome and on its alternate loci. The reads that map to these regions would map twice. To be able to filter reads falling into repetitive regions but keep reads falling into regions present in alternate loci, we will map on the Canonical version of hg38 (only the chromosome with numbers, chrX, chrY, and chrM).

> ### {% icon comment %} Dovetailing
> We will allow dovetailing of read pairs with Bowtie2. This is because adapters are removed by Cutadapt only when at least 3 bases match the adapter sequence, so it is possible that after trimming a read can contain 1-2 bases of adapter and go beyond it's mate start site. For example, if the first mate in the read pair is: `GCTATGAAGAATAGGGCGAAGGGGCCTGCGGCGTATTCGATGTTGAAGCT` and the second mate is `CTTCAACATCGAATACGCCGCAGGCCCCTTCGCCCTATTCTTCATAGCCT`, where both contain 2 bases of adapter sequence, they will not be trimmed by Cutadapt and will map this way:
> ```
<--------------------Mate 1-----------------------
AGCTTCAACATCGAATACGCCGCAGGCCCCTTCGCCCTATTCTTCATAGC
  CTTCAACATCGAATACGCCGCAGGCCCCTTCGCCCTATTCTTCATAGCCT
  ----------------------Mate 2--------------------->
```
This is what we call dovetailing and we want to consider this pair as a valid concordant alignment.

# Filtering Mapped Reads

## Filter Uninformative Reads

We apply some filters to the reads after the mapping. ATAC-Seq datasets can have a lot of reads that map to the mitchondrial genome because it is nucleosome-free and thus very accessible to Tn5 insertion. The mitchondrial genome is uninteresting for ATAC-Seq so we remove these reads. We also remove reads with low mapping quality and reads that are not properly paired.

High numbers of mitochondrial reads can be a problem in ATAC-Seq. Some ATAC-Seq samples have been reported to be 80% mitochondrial reads and so wet-lab methods have been developed to deal with this issue {% cite Corces2017 %} and {% cite Litzenburger2017 %}. It can be a useful QC to assess the number of mitochondrial reads.

## Filter Duplicate Reads

Because of the PCR amplification, there might be read duplicates (different reads mapping to exactly the same genomic region) from overamplification of some regions. As the Tn5 insertion is random within an accessible region, we do not expect to see fragments with the same coordinates. We consider such fragments to be PCR duplicates. We will remove them with **Picard MarkDuplicates**.

## Check Insert Sizes

We will check the insert sizes with **Picard CollectInsertSizeMetrics**. The insert size is the distance between the R1 and R2 read pairs. This tells us the size of the DNA fragment the read pairs came from. The fragment length distribution of a sample gives a very good indication of the quality of the ATAC-Seq.

This fragment size distribution is a good indication if your experiment worked or not.
In absence of chromatin (without nucleosome), this is the profile you would get:

![Fragment size distribution of a purified DNA](../../images/atac-seq/Screenshot_sizeDistribution_Naked.png "Fragment size distribution of a purified DNA")

Here are examples of Fragment size distributions of ATAC-Seq which were very noisy:

![Fragment size distribution of another failed ATAC-Seq](../../images/atac-seq/Screenshot_sizeDistribution_Failed2.png "Fragment size distribution of another very noisy ATAC-Seq")

A final example of a Fragment size distribution of a very good ATAC-Seq, even if we cannot see the third nucleosome "peak".

# Peak calling

## Call Peaks

We have now finished the data preprocessing. Next, in order to find regions corresponding to potential open chromatin regions, we want to identify regions where reads have piled up (peaks) greater than the background read coverage. The tools which are currently used are [Genrich](https://github.com/jsh58/Genrich) and [MACS2](https://github.com/taoliu/MACS). Genrich has a mode dedicated to ATAC-Seq but is still not published, so both are presented here. It is very important at this point that we center the reads on the 5' extremity (read start site) as this is where Tn5 cuts. You want your peaks around the nucleosomes and not directly on the nucleosome:
![Scheme of ATAC-Seq reads relative to nucleosomes](../../images/atac-seq/schemeWithLegend.jpg "Scheme of ATAC-Seq reads relative to nucleosomes")

{: .comment}

If we only assess the coverage of the start sites of the reads, the data would be too sparse and it would be impossible to call peaks. Thus, we will extend the start sites of the reads by 100bp (50 bp in each direction) to assess coverage.

We convert the BAM file to BED format because when we shift the reads with MACS2, it will only consider one of the read pairs.

We call peaks with MACS2. Usually people expand 200bp around cut sites (+/-100bp). Here, to be able to compare with **Genrich**, we will use 100bp.

# Visualisation of Coverage

## Prepare the Datasets

Thanks to **Genrich** we now have a coverage file which represents the coverage of the read start sites extended 50 bp to each side.
The output of **Genrich** is a BedGraph-ish pileup (6 columns text format with a comment line and a header). We will first need to convert it to a bedgraph format (4 columns text format with no header) to be able to visualise it.

### Convert BedGraph-ish pileup of **Genrich** to bedgraph

First, we need to remove the 2 header lines. Then, we select the first 4 columns.

### Convert bedgraph from **Genrich** and **MACS2** to bigwig
The bedgraph format is easily readable for human but it can be very large and visualising a specific region is quite slow. We will change it to bigwig format which is a binary format, so we can visualise any region of the genome very quickly.

### Sort CTCF Peaks
In order to visualise a specific region (e.g. the gene *RAC2*), we can either use a genome browser like **IGV** or **UCSC browser**, or use **pyGenomeTracks** to make publishable figures. We will use **pyGenomeTracks**. The **pyGenomeTracks** tool needs all BED files sorted, thus we sort the CTCF peaks.

## Create heatmap of coverage at TSS with deepTools

You might also be interested in specific regions. For this, you can compute a heatmap. We will use the **deepTools plotHeatmap**. As an example, we will here make a heatmap centered on the transcription start sites (TSS).

### Generate computeMatrix

The input of **plotHeatmap** is a matrix in a hdf5 format. To generate it we use the tool **computeMatrix** that will evaluate the coverage at each locus we are interested in.

### Plot with **plotHeatmap**

We will now generate a heatmap. Each line will be a transcript. The coverage will be summarized with a color code from red (no coverage) to blue (maximum coverage). All TSS will be aligned in the middle of the figure and only the 2 kb around the TSS will be displayed. Another plot, on top of the heatmap, will show the mean signal at the TSS. There will be one heatmap per bigwig.

Unfortunately, Genrich does not work very well with our small training dataset (every covered region is called a peak). This is because most of the data is on chr22 whereas the background model was built on the whole genome. When the pipeline described here was run on 20 million of pairs from the original dataset, this is the output of pyGenomeTracks:

We can see that in this region both peak calling perform the same. However, when zooming out, we see that MACS2 is more sensitive:
![pyGenomeTracks output for 20 million of pairs on the whole genome zoom out](../../images/atac-seq/pyGenomeTracksOutput_20M_zo.png "pyGenomeTracks output for 20 million of pairs on the whole genome zoom out").

When the number of reads increases, the number of peaks with MACS2 increases but the number of peaks with Genrich decreases:
![pyGenomeTracks output for 100 million of pairs on the whole genome zoom out](../../images/atac-seq/pyGenomeTracksOutput_100M_zo.png "pyGenomeTracks output for 100 million of pairs on the whole genome zoom out").
![pyGenomeTracks output for 200 million of pairs on the whole genome zoom out](../../images/atac-seq/pyGenomeTracksOutput_200M_zo.png "pyGenomeTracks output for 200 million of pairs on the whole genome zoom out").


As CTCF binds so ubiquitously and by itself can displace the nucleosome creating accessible regions, a region containing a peak with no corresponding CTCF peak or TSS could be a putative enhancer. In the pyGenomeTracks plot we see a region like this located in the intron of a gene and another one between genes. However, it is impossible to guess from the position which would be the gene controlled by this region. And of course, more analyses are needed to assess if it is a real enhancer, for example, histone ChIP-seq, 3D structure, transgenic assay, etc.


# Conclusion

In this training you have learned the general principles of ATAC-Seq data analysis. ATAC-Seq
is a method to investigate the chromatin accessibility and the genome is treated with
a transposase (enzyme) called Tn5. It marks open chromatin regions by cutting and
inserting adapters for sequencing. The training material gave you an insight into how to quality control the data. You should look for low quality bases, adapter contamination, correct insert size and PCR duplicates (duplication level). We showed you how to remove adapters and PCR duplicates, if **FastQC**, shows a warning in these areas. We mapped the reads
with **Bowtie2**, filtered our reads for properly paired, good quality and reads that do not
map to the mitochondrial genome. We found open chromatin regions with **Genrich**, a tool to find regions of genomic enrichment (peaks). We investigated the read coverage around TSS with the help of **computeMatrix** and **plotHeatmap**. Last but not least, we visualised the peaks and other informative tracks, such as CTCF binding regions and hg38 genes, with the help of **pyGenomeTracks**. At the end, we found open chromatin regions that did not overlap with CTCF sites or TSS, which could be potential putative enhancer regions detected by the ATAC-Seq experiment.
