      In this HiCExplorer tutorial we will generate and plot a Hi-C contact
      matrix. For this the following steps are necessary to be performed:<ul>
        <li>1. Map the Hi-C reads to the reference genome</li>
        <li>2. Creation of a Hi-C matrix</li>
        <li>3. Plotting the Hi-C matrix</li>
        <li>4. Correction of Hi-C matrix</li>
        <li>5. TAD Calling</li></ul>
      After a corrected Hi-C matrix is created other tools can be used to
      visualize it, call TADS or compare it with other matrices.

      <i>hicBuildMatrix</i> creates two files, a bam file containing only the
      valid Hi-C read pairs and a matrix containing the Hi-C contacts at the
      given resolution. The bam file is useful to check the quality of the Hi-C
      library on the genome browser. A good Hi-C library should contain piles of
      reads near the restriction fragment sites. In the QCfolder a html file is
      saved with plots containing useful information for the quality control of
      the Hi-C sample like the number of valid pairs, duplicated pairs,
      self-ligations etc. Usually, only 25%-40% of the reads are valid and used
      to build the Hi-C matrix mostly because of the reads that are on
      repetitive regions that need to be discarded.<br><br>

      Normally 25% of the total reads are selected. The output matrices have
      counts for the genomic regions. The extension of output matrix files is
      .h5 or .cool. A quality report is created have a look at the history item <b>hicBuildMatrix QC on data X</b>.

      and the time to plot it is very long (minutes instead of seconds). In
      order to reduce the resolution we use the tool <a target="_blank"

      corrects the matrix counts in an iterative manner. For correcting the
      matrix, it’s important to remove the unassembled scaffolds (e.g. NT_) and
      keep only chromosomes, as scaffolds create problems with matrix
      correction. Therefore we use the chromosome names (chr2R, chr2L, chr3R,
      chr3L, chrX) here.<br><br>

      Matrix correction works in two steps: first a histogram containing the sum
      of contact per bin (row sum) is produced. This plot needs to be inspected
      to decide the best threshold for removing bins with lower number of reads.
      The second steps removes the low scoring bins and does the correction.

      In our case the distribution describes the counts per bin of a genomic
      distance. To remove all bins with a z-score threshold less / more than X
      means to remove all bins which have less / more counts than X of mean of
      their specific distribution in units of the standard deviation. Looking at
      the distribution, we can select the value of -1.6 (lower end) and 1.8
      (upper end) to remove. This is given by the –filterThreshold option in
      hicCorrectMatrix set to ‘correct matrix’ mode.

      <br><br>TAD calling works in two steps: First HiCExplorer computes a
      TAD-separation score based on a z-score matrix for all bins. Then those
      bins having a local minimum of the TAD-separation score are evaluated with
      respect to the surrounding bins to assign a p-value. Then a cutoff is
      applied to select the bins more likely to be TAD boundaries.<br><br>

    content: >-
      In this tutorial we used HiCExplorer to analyze drosophila melanogaster
      cells. We mapped the chimeric reads and created a contact matrix, to
      reduce noise this contact matrix was normalized. We showed how to
      visualize a contact matrix and how we can investigate topological
      associating domains and relate them to additional data like gene tracks.

    content: |-
      <ul>
        <li>Hi-C helps to investigate the 3D structure of the genome and to uncover folding principles of chromatin.</li>
        <li>In order to build a Hi-C contact matrix the reads have to be mapped to the reference genome.</li>
        <li>Based on a contact matrix open and closed chromatin (A/B compartments) and topological associating domains (TADs) can be computed.</li>
      </ul>
