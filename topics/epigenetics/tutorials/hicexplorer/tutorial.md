# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

In this HiCExplorer tutorial we will generate and plot a Hi-C contact matrix.
For this the following steps are necessary to be performed:
1. Map the Hi-C reads to the reference genome
2. Creation of a Hi-C matrix
3. Plotting the Hi-C matrix
4. Correction of Hi-C matrix
5. TAD Calling
6. A/B compartments computation
7. pyGenomeTracks visualization
8. Loop detection


After a corrected Hi-C matrix is created other tools can be used to visualize it, call TADS or compare it with other matrices.

A usual start point for a typical analysis is the given GSE number of a publication, e.g. GSE63525 for Rao 2014. To get the actual data, go to [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and search for the [GSE number](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63525). In the section 'Samples' the GSM numbers of all samples are given. Select the correct one for you, and go to the [European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) and enter the GSM number. Select a matching result e.g. [SRX764936](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/SRX764936) and download the data given in the row 'FASTQ files (FTP)' the forward and reverse strand.

# Reads mapping

Mates have to be mapped individually to avoid mapper specific heuristics designed for standard paired-end libraries.

We have used the HiCExplorer successfully with bwa, bowtie2 and hisat2. In this tutorial we will be using **Map with BWA-MEM** tool. It is important to remember to:
- use local mapping, in contrast to end-to-end. A fraction of Hi-C reads are chimeric and will not map end-to-end thus, local mapping is important to increase the number of mapped reads
- tune the aligner parameters to penalize deletions and insertions. This is important to avoid aligned reads with gaps if they happen to be chimeric.
- If bowtie2 or hisat2 are used, `--reorder` option and as a file format `bam_native` needs to be used. Regular `bam` files are sorted by Galaxy and can not be used as an input for HiCExplorer.

# Creation of a Hi-C matrix

Once the reads have been mapped the Hi-C matrix can be built.

For this step we will use [hicBuildMatrix](http://hicexplorer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/hicBuildMatrix.html#hicbuildmatrix) tool, which builds the matrix of read counts over the bins in the genome, considering the sites around the given restriction site.

The bam file is useful to check the quality of the Hi-C library on the genome browser. A good Hi-C library should contain piles of reads near the restriction fragment sites. In the QC folder a html file is saved with plots containing useful information for the quality control of the Hi-C sample like the number of valid pairs, duplicated pairs, self-ligations etc. Usually, only 25%-40% of the reads are valid and used to build the Hi-C matrix mostly because of the reads that are on repetitive regions that need to be discarded.

# Plotting the Hi-C matrix

A 10kb bin matrix is too large to plot, it's better to reduce the resolution. We usually run out of memory for a 1 kb or a 10 kb bin matrix and the time to plot it is very long (minutes instead of seconds). In order to reduce the resolution we use the tool [hicMergeMatrixBins](http://hicexplorer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/hicMergeMatrixBins.html#hicmergematrixbins).

[hicMergeMatrixBins](http://hicexplorer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/hicMergeMatrixBins.html#hicmergematrixbins) merges the bins into larger bins of given number (specified by –numBins). We will merge 100 bins in the original (uncorrected) matrix and then correct it. The new bin size is going to be 10.000 bp * 100 = 1.000.000 bp = 1 Mb

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: hicMergeMatrixBins
>
> 1. **hicMergeMatrixBins** {% icon tool %}: Run hicMergeMatrixBins on the output from previous step setting the following parameter:

The resulting plot of the 1 Mb contact matrix should look like:
![TAD plot](../../images/plotMatrix.png)

# Correction of Hi-C matrix


[hicCorrectMatrix](http://hicexplorer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/hicCorrectMatrix.html#hiccorrectmatrix) corrects the matrix counts in an iterative manner. For correcting the matrix, it’s important to remove the unassembled scaffolds (e.g. NT_) and keep only chromosomes, as scaffolds create problems with matrix correction. Therefore we use the chromosome names (chr2R, chr2L, chr3R, chr3L, chrX) here.


Matrix correction works in two steps: first a histogram containing the sum of contact per bin (row sum) is produced. This plot needs to be inspected to decide the best threshold for removing bins with lower number of reads. The second steps removes the low scoring bins and does the correction.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Matrix diagnostic
>
> 1. **hicCorrectMatrix** {% icon tool %}: Run hicCorrectMatrix on the output from hicBuildMatrix `10 kb contact matrix` adjusting the parameters:
>    - "Range restriction (in bp)" to `Diagnostic plot`
>    - "Chromosomes to include (and order to plot in)" to `chr2L`
>    - "+ Insert Chromosomes to include (and order to plot in):" to `chr2R`
>    - "+ Insert Chromosomes to include (and order to plot in):" to `chr3L`
>    - "+ Insert Chromosomes to include (and order to plot in):" to `chr3R`
>    - "+ Insert Chromosomes to include (and order to plot in):" to `chrX`
>
{: .hands_on}

The output of the program prints a threshold suggestion that is usually accurate but is better to revise the histogram plot. The threshold is visualized in the plot as a black vertical line.

In our case the distribution describes the counts per bin of a genomic distance. To remove all bins with a z-score threshold less / more than X means to remove all bins which have less / more counts than X of mean of their specific distribution in units of the standard deviation. Looking at the distribution, we can select the value of -1.6 (lower end) and 1.8 (upper end) to remove. This is given by the –filterThreshold option in hicCorrectMatrix set to 'correct matrix' mode.

>

>
{: .hands_on}

It can happen that the correction stops with:

```
ERROR:iterative correction:*Error* matrix correction produced extremely large values.
This is often caused by bins of low counts. Use a more stringent filtering of bins.
```

This can be solved by a more stringent z-score values for the filter threshold or by a look at the plotted matrix. For example, chromosomes with 0 reads in its bins can be excluded from the correction by not defining it for the set of chromosomes that should be corrected (parameter 'Include chromosomes').

### Plotting the corrected Hi-C matrix

We can now plot chromosome 2L with the corrected matrix.

### Load new data

The steps so far would have led to long run times if real data would have been used. We therefore prepared a new matrix for you, `corrected contact matrix dm3 large`. Please load it into your history.

# TAD calling

“The partitioning of chromosomes into topologically associating domains (TADs) is an emerging concept that is reshaping our understanding of gene regulation in the context of physical organization of the genome” [Ramirez et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1101/115063).

TAD calling works in two steps: First HiCExplorer computes a TAD-separation score based on a z-score matrix for all bins. Then those bins having a local minimum of the TAD-separation score are evaluated with respect to the surrounding bins to assign a p-value. Then a cutoff is applied to select the bins more likely to be TAD boundaries.

[hicFindTADs](http://hicexplorer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/hicFindTADs.html#hicfindtads) tries to identify sensible parameters but those can be change to identify more stringent set of boundaries.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Finding TADs
>
> 1. **hicFindTADs** {% icon tool %}: Run hicFindTADs on `corrected contact matrix dm3 large` adjusting the parameters:
>    - "Minimum window length (in bp) to be considered to the left and to the right of each Hi-C bin." to `30000`
>    - "Maximum window length (in bp) to be considered to the left and to the right of each Hi-C bin." to `100000`
>    - "Step size when moving from minDepth to maxDepth" to `10000`
>    - "Multiple Testing Corrections" to `False discovery rate`
>    - "q-value" to `0.05`
>    - "Minimum threshold of the difference between the TAD-separation score of a putative boundary and the mean of the TAD-sep. score of surrounding bins." to `0.001`
>
{: .hands_on}

As an output we get the boundaries, domains and scores separated files. We will use in the plot later only the TAD-score file.

The first principal component correlates with the chromosome arms, while the second component correlates with A/B compartments. 

# Integrating Hi-C and other data

We can plot the TADs for a given chromosomal region. For this we will use [pyGenomeTracks](http://hicexplorer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/hicPlotTADs.html).

For the next step we need additional data tracks. Please load `dm3_genes.bed`, `H3K27me3.bw`, `H3K36me3.bw` and `H4K16ac.bw` to your history.

# Loop detection

In Hi-C data, the term `loop` refers to a 3D structure which represents enhancer-promoter, gene, architectural or polycomb-mediated interactions. These interactions have the characteristics to be enriched in a single region compared to the local background. These loops are also called long-range interactions with an expected maximum distance of 2 MB (see [Rao et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2014.11.021)).

![Loops visualization](../../images/loops_bonev_cavalli.png)

To compute loops, we have to import a new data set from the shared library to our history: `GM12878-MboI-allreps-filtered.10kb.cool` or download it via the <a href="ftp://cooler.csail.mit.edu/coolers/hg19/Rao2014-GM12878-MboI-allreps-filtered.10kb.cool">FTP cool files server</a>. (FTP links seems to be blocked, therefore the full URL: `ftp://cooler.csail.mit.edu/coolers/hg19/Rao2014-GM12878-MboI-allreps-filtered.10kb.cool`)

This dataset is from the human cell GM12878, mapped to hg19 and of 10 kb resolution. We use a new file because to detect loop structures the read coverage is required to be in the hunderts of million; this was not the case for the previous used drosophila dataset.

{: .hands_on}

We now investigate the result of hicInfo and see that the new imported file is having 1.2 billion non-zero elements, while the drosophila Hi-C interaction matrix has around 12 million non-zero elements.

>    - "P-value" to `0.01`
>    - "Chromosomes to include" to `chr1`
>
{: .hands_on}


The detection of the loops is based on a pre-selection of interactions, a p-value given a continuous negative binomial distribution over all interactions of a relative distance is computed. All interactions are filtered with a threshold (`p-value preselection`) to retrieve loop candidates. In a second step, the selected peak candidate is compared against its background using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

As an output we get a loop file containing the positions of both anchor points of the loop and the p-value of the used statistical test.

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

In this tutorial we used HiCExplorer to analyze drosophila melanogaster cells. We mapped chimeric reads and created a contact matrix, to reduce noise this contact matrix was normalized. We showed how to visualize a contact matrix and how we can investigate topological associating domains and relate them to additional data like gene tracks. Moreover, we used a human Hi-C interaction matrix to compute loop structures.


 To improve your learned skills we offer an additional tutorial based on mouse stem cells: [following work](http://hicexplorer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/example_usage.html).
