  H3K4me3 and CTCF between the X (active or inactive) chromosomes and the
  potentially influenced genes (only use the wild type data).

  - title: Introduction
    content: >-
      Within a cell nucleus, the DNA is tightly-packed and the chromatin is
      spatially distributed with different levels and scales of
      organizations.<br><br> At the smallest scale, DNA is packaged into units
      called nucleosomes, made of eight histone proteins.<br><br> On a larger
      scale than nucleosomes, DNA is forming loops. DNA elements that would be
      otherwise separated by large distances can interact. The corresponding
      self-interacting (or self-associating) domains are found in many
      organisms: they are called Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) in
      mammalian cells. Mammalian chromosomes are also partitioned into two
      spatial compartments, labeled “A” and “B”, where regions in compartment A
      tend to interact preferentially with A compartment-associated regions than
      B compartment-associated ones. Similarly, regions in compartment B tend to
      associate with other B compartment-associated regions.

      In mammals, the X chromosome inactivation (XCI) balances the dosage of
      X-linked genes between females and males. The genes on the inactive X (Xi)
      chromosome are not expressed.<br><br> Binding certain proteins to each of
      the eight histone proteins may modify the chromatin structure and may
      result in changes in transcription level. For example, the H3K4m3 is
      adding 3 methyl-group of the 4th Lysine in the histone 3 amino-acid. This
      modification is known to activate the transcription on nearby genes by
      opening the chromatin. The H3K27me3 on the other hand is inactivating the
      transcription of the nearby genes. <br><br>More H3K27me3 and less H3K4m3
      on the Xi could explain a lower expression of the genes there.
    backdrop: true
  - title: Introduction
    content: >-
      It has been also observed that the Xi adopts a distinct conformation
      without evident compartments or TAD. cohesins, condensins and
      CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) play key roles in chromosomal architectures
      and TAD formation which are other potential cause of the repression of the
      expression of the genes on Xi. The structural-maintenance-of-chromosomes
      hinge domain containing 1 (SMCHD1) has been found enriched on the Xi. It
      may be the potential actor in the shape of Xi and the change in gene
      expression there. <br><br><a
      href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30584-1">Wang et
      al. (2018)</a> investigates the mechanism by which the SMCHD1 gene shapes
      the Xi and represses the expression of the genes on Xi in mouse.
      <br><br>Their idea was to identify the differences which could be observed
      between the Xi and activated X chromosome, on both wild-type and SMCHD1
      gene knockdown samples to study the SMCHD1 effect. In different
      experiments, they targeted histones with H3K27me3 or H3K4me3 and CTCF
      using ChIP-seq experiments.

      They obtained sequences corresponding to a portion of DNA linked to
      histones with H3K27me3, H3K4me3 or CTCF. Using this information, they
      could identify if there are differences in the H3K27me3, H3K4me3 and CTCF
      between the X (active or inactive) chromosomes and the potentially
      influenced genes.<br><br> In the upcoming tutorial, we will only use the
      wild type data from <a
      href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30584-1">Wang et

        <li>‘input’ with 2 replicates: <b>wt_input_rep1</b> and <b>wt_input_rep2</b></li>
      </ul> In ‘input’ samples, the same treatment as the ChIP-seq samples was
      done except for the immunoprecipitation step. They are also used along
      with the ‘ChIP-seq’ samples to identify the potential sequencing bias and
      help for differential analysis.

      During sequencing, errors are introduced, such as incorrect nucleotides

      lead to a misinterpretation of the data.<br><br> Sequence quality control
      is therefore an essential first step in your analysis. We use here similar

  - title: Mapping of the reads
    content: >-
      With ChiP sequencing, we obtain sequences corresponding to portion of DNA
      linked to histones with H3K4me3. As H3K4me3 opens the chromatime, nearby
      genes are more transcribed. It would be interesting to know if there is a
      difference in the quantity of DNA impacted by H3K4me3 and the impacted
      genes between active and inactive X chromosome.<br><br> We first need to
      figure out where the sequenced DNA fragments originated from in the
      genome. The reads must be aligned to a reference genome to identify the
      binding sites.<br><br> This is equivalent to solving a jigsaw puzzles, but
      unfortunately, not all pieces are unique.

  - title: Mapping of the reads
    content: >-
      In principle, we could do a BLAST analysis to figure out where the
      sequenced pieces fit best in the known genome. Aligning millions of short
      sequences this way may, however, take a couple of weeks. And we do not
      really care about the exact base to base correspondence
      (<b>alignment</b>). What we are really interested in is “where these reads
      came from”. This approach is called <b>mapping</b>. <br><br>Nowadays,
      there are many mapping programs for shotgun sequenced DNA. We will use <a
