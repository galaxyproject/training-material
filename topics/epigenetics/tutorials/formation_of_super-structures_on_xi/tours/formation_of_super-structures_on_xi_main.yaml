  In this tutorial we will follow <a
  href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30584-1">Wang et al.
  (2018)</a> experiments to identify if there are differences in the H3K27me3,
  H3K4me3 and CTCF between the X (active or inactive) chromosomes and the
  potentially influenced genes (only use the wild type data).

steps:
  - title: ChIP-seq Quality Control
    content: >-
      We already checked the quality of the raw sequencing reads in the first
      step. Now we would like to test the quality of the ChIP-seq preparation,
      to know if our ChIP-seq samples are more enriched than the control (input)
      samples.
    backdrop: true
  - title: Correlation between samples
    content: >-
      To assess the similarity between the replicates of the ChIP and the input,
      respectively, it is a common technique to calculate the correlation of
      read counts on different regions for all different samples. We expect that
      the replicates of the ChIP-seq experiments should be clustered more
      closely to each other than the replicates of the input sample. That is,
      because the input samples should not have enriched regions included -
      remember the immuno-precipitation step was skiped during the sample
      preparation.<br><br> To compute the correlation between the samples we are
      going to to use the QC modules of <a
      href="http://deeptools.readthedocs.io/">deepTools</a>, a software package
      for the QC, processing and analysis of NGS data. Before computing the
      correlation a time consuming step is required, which is to compute the
      read coverage (number of unique reads mapped at a given nucleotide) over a
      large number of regions from each of the inputed BAM files. For this we
      will use the tool <b>multiBamSummary</b> tool. Then, we use
      <b>plotCorrelation</b> tool from deepTools to compute and visualize the
      sample correlation. This is a fast process that allows to quickly try
      different color combinations and outputs.
    backdrop: true
  - title: Correlation between samples
    content: >-
      Since in this tutorial we are interested in assessing H3K4me3, H3K27me3
      and CTCF ChIP samples, the previous steps (quality control and mapping)
      needs to be run on all the replicates of ChIP samples as well as the input
      samples. To save time, we have already done that and you can now work
      directly on the BAM files of the provided 8 samples. For simplicity, the
      files include only the ChrX.

  - title: IP strength estimation
    content: >-
      To evaluate the quality of the immuno-precipitation(IP) step, we can
      compute the IP strength. It determines how well the signal in the ChIP-seq
      sample can be differentiated from the background distribution of reads in
      the control sample (‘input’). After all, around 90% of all DNA fragments
      in a ChIP experiment will represent the genomic background.<br><br> To do
      that we take the data from the <i>rep1</i> of the <i>wt_H3K4me3</i>
      ChIP-seq sample and compare it with its corresponding input sample, using
      <b>plotFingerprint</b> tool of deepTools. Similar to
      <b>multiBamSummary</b> tool, <b>plotFingerprint</b> tool randomly samples
      genome regions of a specified length (bins) and sums the per-base coverage
      in the indexed BAM files that overlap with those regions. These coverage
      values are then sorted according to their rank and the cumulative sum of
      read counts is plotted.

      An ideal ‘input’ with perfect uniform distribution of reads along the
      genome (i.e. without enrichments in open chromatin) and infinite
      sequencing coverage should generate a straight diagonal line. A very
      specific and strong ChIP enrichment will be indicated by a prominent and
      steep rise of the cumulative sum towards the highest rank. This means that
      a big chunk of reads from the ChIP sample is located in few bins which
      corresponds to high, narrow enrichments typically seen for transcription
      factors.

      One of the goals in ChIP-seq data analysis is finding regions on the
      genome which are enriched for the ChIP data of interest (regions with
      significantly higher read coverage for the ChIP data comparing to its
      corresponding input). In the following exercise we would like to know
      where the H3K4me3 sites are. For this we need to extract which parts of
      the genome have been enriched (i.e. more reads mapped) within the samples
      that underwent immunoprecipitation. However, to reach a reliable
      comparison the data needs to be normalized to remove any technical bias.
      For the normalization we have two steps: <ul>
        <li>Normalization by sequencing depth</li>
        <li>Normalization by input file</li>
      </ul> To learn how to do the normalization, we will take the
      <b>wt_H3K4me3_rep1</b> sample as ChIP data and <b>wt_input_rep1</b> as
      input.

      The different samples have usually a different sequencing depth, i.e. a
      different number of reads. These differences can bias the interpretation
      of the number of reads mapped to a specific genome region. We first need
      to make the samples comparable by normalizing the coverage by the
      sequencing depth.<br><br> We are using <b>bamCoverage</b> tool. Given a
      BAM file, this tool generates coverages by first calculating all the
      number of reads (either extended to match the fragment length or not) that
      overlap each bin in the genome and then normalizing with various options.
      It produces a coverage file where for each bin the number of overlapping
      reads (possibly normalized) is noted.

  - title: Conclusion
    content: >-
      Along this tutorial, we learn how to extract peaks and coverage
      information from raw data of ChIP experiments. This information can be
      then related to the biology to answer the original question. We tried then
      to relate the observed differences of peak and read coverage between
      H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 to the known biology. We could go even further in the
      analysis to reproduce the results of the original paper (e.g. by looking
      at the bivalent genes, identifying the differences between Xa and Xi).

      <ul>
        <li>ChIP-seq data requires multiple methods of quality assessment to ensure that the data is of high quality.</li>
        <li>Multiple normalization methods exists depending on the availability of input data.</li>
        <li>Heatmaps containing all genes of an organism can be easily plotted given a BED file and a coverage file.</li></ul>
