# Introduction
In many organism, {TF} play an important tole in the regulation of the gene expression. In human, we have up to 2,800 proteins and more than 1,600 are
TF ([list of transcription factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_transcription_factors)), although the number might change over timer.
Investigating the role of TFs, such as [GATA1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GATA1), is a very important task to understand the regulatory mechanisms in the cell and thus ascertain
the source of a disease, such as [myelofibrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_myelofibrosis) a type of blood cancer.

![CUT_and_RUN](../../images/cut_and_run/cut_and_run.png "Skene and Henikoff 2017 eLIFE")

{CUT&RUN} {% cite Skene2017 %} became the new and advanced method to analyse DNA-associated proteins. CUT&RUN uses an antibody just as [ChIP-Seq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChIP_sequencing) to select the {POI}.
The big difference, CUT&RUN couples the usage of an antibody with the usage of a pA-MNase, which you can see in **Figure 1**. In the revised version of the protocol {% cite Meers2019 %},
the pA-MNase has been replaced by a {pA(G)-MNase} to expand this technology to mouse primary antibodies. The [enzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrococcal_nuclease) fused to the protein A/G is an
endo-exonuclease that cleaves and shortens DNA. The fusion will ensure that the MNase comes in close proximity with the POI and thus cleaves DNA *in-situ*, close to POI binding sites. CUT&RUN allows to
fragment the DNA in unfixed cells and thus allows to study protein-DNA interactions in a more natural state. The added pA(G)-MNase thus creates shorted fragments that lead to a higher resolution for the mapping
in comparison to your standard ChIP-Seq protocol. CUT&RUN follows four fundamental steps: (1) permeabilize the nuclei or cells coated on beads, (2) incubate with the selective antibody of the POI, (3)
add the pA(G)-MNase and activate the enzyme for a small period of time, (4) release CUT&RUN fragments and collect the DNA from the supernatant. Afterward, the DNA can be purified, PCR amplified and
prepared for sequencing. You can find the CUT&RUN protocol at [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/view/cut-amp-run-targeted-in-situ-genome-wide-profiling-14egnr4ql5dy/v3).

In this tutorial, we will use data from the study of {% cite Zhu2019 %}. The article introduces a CUT&RUN pipeline that we will **not** completely follow. It is important to note at this point that
a CUT&RUN data analysis is more similar to an ATAC-Seq experiment than a standard ChIP-Seq. We will analyze the two biological replicates from a CUT&RUN experiment for the aforementioned TF GATA1 in humans.
We downsampled the data to speed up the run times in this tutorial. Our results will be compared to identified binding sites of GATA1 of a ChIP-Seq experiment {% cite Canver2017 %}.

## When working with real data
The workflow for this training material can be found [at the European Galaxy instance](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/heylf/w/copy-of-cutandrunlong). When you use your data we suggest using [this workflow](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/heylf/w/cutandrunlong)
which includes additional steps for your data analysis. Both workflows do not support peak calling with controls as CUT&RUN has a low background.
It is often recommended to use a positive or negative control as a comparison. Spike-in controls can be done for CUT&RUN but need then additional steps in the provided workflows to consider them.

# Step 1: Preprocessing

## Get Data

We first need to download the sequenced reads (FASTQs) as well as other annotation files. Then, to increase the number of reads that will map to the reference genome (here human genome version 38, GRCh38/hg38), we need to preprocess the reads.

## Quality Control

We first have to check if our data contains adapter sequences that we have to remove. A typical CUT&RUN experiment has a read length of 30-80 nt. We can check the raw data quality with **FastQC**.

The FastQC report pointed out that we have in our data some standard Illumina adapter sequences, which we will remove with Trim Galore!.

## Trimming Reads

**Trim Galore!** is a handy tool that can automatically detect and trim standard Illumina adapters.

# Step 2: Mapping

## Mapping Reads to Reference Genome

Next, we map the trimmed reads to the human reference genome. Here we will use **Bowtie2**. We will extend the maximum fragment length (distance between read pairs) from 500 to 1000 because
we know some valid read pairs are from this fragment length. We will use the `--very-sensitive` parameter to have more chances to get the best match even if it takes a bit longer to run.
We will run the **end-to-end** mode because we trimmed the adapters, so we expect the whole read to map, no clipping of ends is needed. Regarding the genome to choose.
The hg38 version of the human genome contains [alternate loci](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc/help/definitions/#ALTERNATE). This means that some regions of the genome
are present both in the canonical chromosome and on its alternate loci. The reads that map to these regions would map twice. To be able to filter reads falling into
repetitive regions but keep reads falling into regions present in alternate loci, we will map on the Canonical version of hg38 (only the chromosome with numbers, chrX, chrY, and chrM).

> <comment-title>Dovetailing</comment-title>
> We will allow dovetailing of read pairs with Bowtie2. This is because adapters are removed by Cutadapt only when at least 3 bases match the adapter sequence, so it is possible that after trimming a read can contain 1-2 bases of adapter and go beyond it's mate start site. This occurs especially for CUT&RUN because the read length is quite short. Bowtie thus discards reads such as:
> ```
> ---------------------Mate 1--------------------------------->
> <---------------------Mate 2----------------------
> ```
>
> or
>
> ```
> ---------------------Mate 1--------------------------------->
> <---------------------Mate 2---------------------------------
> ```
>
> This is what we call dovetailing and we want to consider this pair as a valid concordant alignment.

# Step 3: Filtering Mapped Reads and second level Quality Control

## Filter Uninformative Reads

We apply some filters to the reads after the mapping. CUT&RUN datasets can have many reads that map to the mitochondrial genome because it is nucleosome-free and thus very accessible
to the pA(G)-MNase. CUT&RUN inserts adapter more easily in open chromatin regions due to the pA(G)-MNase activity. The mitochondrial genome is uninteresting for CUT&RUN,
so we remove these reads. We also remove reads with low mapping quality and reads that are not properly paired.

## Filter Duplicate Reads

Because of the PCR amplification, there might be read duplicates (different reads mapping to the same genomic region) from over amplification of some regions. We will remove them with **Picard MarkDuplicates**.

Once again, if you have a high number of duplicates it does not mean that your data are not good, it just means that you sequenced
too much compared to the diversity of the library you generated. Consequently, libraries with a high portion of duplicates should not be re-sequenced as this would not increase the amount of data.

## Check Insert Sizes

We will check the insert sizes with **Paired-end histogram** of insert size frequency. The insert size is the distance between the R1 and R2 read pairs. This tells us the size of the DNA fragment the read pairs came from. The fragment length distribution of a sample gives an excellent indication of the quality of the CUT and RUN experiment.

This fragment size distribution is a good indication if your experiment worked or not. The CUT&RUN yield can gradually increase over the digestion time {% cite Skene2017 %}, which of course depends on the enzyme used for the cleavage of the DNA.

![CUT and RUN yield](../../images/cut_and_run/cut_and_run_yield.png "Fragment length distributions of a CUT&RUN experiment with uniform digestion over time. No anti-FLAG primary antibody (No Ab). The track with No_Ab is the control experiment. Data is from two biological replicates. The studied protein showed fragments of size ≤120 bp corresponding to the binding sites, as seen on the left, whereas reads with ≥150 bp fragment size are randomly distributed in the local vicinity. The yield in the example increases from 5s to 10 minutes, which can be seen in the mapped profiles in the right. (Skene and Henikoff 2017 eLife)")

# Step 4: Peak calling

## Call Peaks

We have now finished the data preprocessing. Next, to find regions corresponding to potential binding sites, we want to identify regions where reads have piled up (peaks) greater than the background read coverage. [MACS2](https://github.com/taoliu/MACS) is widely used for CUT&RUN.

At this step, two approaches exist: Like in ATAC-Seq, we have to take a few things into account. The pA(G)-MNase does not need to bind the protein it can create fragments unspecifically a
few bases downstream and upstream away from the true binding site. This is to the *"long"* arms of the proteins. A big jump can happen if a nucleosome is between the protein binding site and the cutting site.

It is critical to re-center the signal since the pA(G)-MNase cuts in different distances. Since some read pairs are not symmetric (i.e., the first mate might be further away from the
binding site than the second mate) we will turn off the shifting mode of MACS2 and apply a direct shift. If we only assess the coverage of the 5' extremity of the reads, the data would be too sparse,
and it would be impossible to call peaks. Thus, we will extend the start sites of the reads by 200bp (100bp in each direction) to assess coverage.

### Using MACS2

We convert the BAM file to BED format because when we set the extension size in MACS2, it will only consider one read of the pair while here we would like to use the information from both.

> <hands-on-title>Convert the BAM to BED</hands-on-title>

>    - {% icon param-collection %} *"Convert the following BAM file to BED"*: Select the output of **MarkDuplicates** {% icon tool %} BAM output
>
{: .hands_on}

We call peaks with MACS2. To get the coverage centered on the 5' extended 100bp each side we will use `--shift -100` and `--extend 200`:

# Step 5: Identifying Binding Motifs

## Prepare the Datasets


### Extracting individual replicates from your dataset collection

In the following step, we want to apply a tool to identify robust peaks between our two replicates. However, we still have one dataset collection, holding both replicates, which we have to split.

### Extract Robust Peaks
MACS helped us to identify potential binding sites for GATA1. Yet, our peak set will contain false positives because of technical and biological noise.
We can first try to reduce some noise using the results for our two biological replicates. Since we applied MACS we have created two peak files.
Yet, both replicates have peaks that are only present in one replicate and thus might be a potential false positive due to noise.
We can remove such peaks if we simply overlap the two peak files and consequently search for peaks that appear in both replicates.

> > > 3. Finding robust peaks is a tricky process and not as simple as you think. Our approach defines a robust peak as an entity that is covered by two similar peaks in either one of the peak files of our two replicates. Our measurement for similarity is simply the amount of bases the peaks overlap. Yet, ask yourself, how much overlap do you need to state that they are similar? Is 1 base enough or maybe 10? The answer is not true or false and like so often needs more investigation. We define the overlap by a 50% fraction of each of the peak files. That means, if our peak in A is 100 bases then A has to overlap with 50 bases with the peak in file B.
> > > 4. **"Require that the fraction of overlap be reciprocal for A and B"** means that 50% of the peak in file A overlaps with the peak in file B and also 50% of the peak in file B overlaps with the peak in file A. We set this to make our filtering very conservative and filter for peaks that we can be sure are true positives. For example, A has a 10 bp peak that overlaps a peak in B with 100 bp. **Viewpoint of file A:** An overlap-fraction of 0.5 for A means that we accept peak A if it overlaps with 5 bp with the peak in B. This is very likely because the peak in B is 100 bp long. **Viewpoint of file B**: An overlap-fraction of 0.5 for B means that we reject A no matter what, even if A completely overlaps B because 10 bp are not enough to cover 50% of B. That is to say the option **"Require that the fraction of overlap be reciprocal for A and B"** takes care that we trust peaks that have in file A **and** in file B a fair overlap.

Note, that this is one way to define robust peaks. Yet, there are more sophisticated algorithms in Galaxy, such as
{% tool [IDR compare ranked list of identifications](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/idr/idr/2.0.3) %}, and other methods that can help to define a robust peak.
The tool **IDR** has not been tested so far for CUT and RUN.

### Extract Positive Peaks

We can further remove some noise with a positive control, that is why we have downloaded a peak set from a ChIP experiment of GATA1.

## Motif detection with MEME-ChIP

Let's find out the sequence motifs of the TF GATA1. Studies have revealed that GATA1 has the DNA binding motif (T/A)GATA(A/G) {% cite Hasegawa2017 %}. In this last task we search for this motif in our data.

![MEME-ChiP motifs for GATA1](../../images/cut_and_run/GATA_motif.png "Plot of the first five sequence motifs of MEME-ChIP.")

Let us first investigate the result of MEME-ChIP. **First column:** The x-axis of the sequence plots represents the nucleotide position of the motif.
The y-axis stands for the total information (uncertainty) and thus stands for the probability that the nucleotide at a certain position is the specific letter (for DNA: T,C,G,A).
Bigger letters stand for a higher probability. For more information please read [the corresponding Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_logo). **Second column:** Defines the algorithm that found the sequence motif.
MEME-ChIP uses two different approaches called MEME and DREME, which can find more complex or simpler motifs. More information about these tools can be found [in the Meme documentation](http://meme-suite.org/).
**Third column:** Defines the E-value, which represents the expected number of times we would find our sequence motif in a database (peak file), just by chance.
This means, that a small E-value corresponds to a very significant motif because the expected number we would find that motif in our peak file just by chance is very low.
Other sequences like repeats will have a high E-value on the other hand. **Fourth column:** This graph is the result of CentriMo, a tool that shows the distribution of
the best matches for that particular motif. The vertical line is the center of the motif. Therefore, if you have a long sequence motif CentriMo helps you to pinpoint a smaller sub-motif.
You can find more information on CentriMo [in the Meme documentation](https://meme-suite.org/meme/doc/centrimo.html).

The results of MEME-ChIP endorse the findings about the DNA binding motif (T/A)GATA(A/G) {% cite Hasegawa2017 %}. We also found other motifs, that might be secondary sequence motifs.
This, we could test with a deeper analysis.

# Conclusion

In this training, you have learned the general principles of CUT&RUN data analysis. CUT&RUN is a method to analyse DNA-associated proteins. In contrast to ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN couples the
antibody with a pA(G)-MNase to reduce the size of the obtained sequences to increase the accuracy for the detection of the protein interaction. Based on this training material,
you gained some insights into the quality control of the data. You should know some pitfalls of CUT&RUN and look for adapter contamination and PCR duplicates, which disrupt the later enrichment analysis.
You learned about **Bowtie2** to do the alignment, and how to filter for properly paired, good-quality and reads that do not map to the mitochondrial genome. Furthermore, you learned that
an indicator for a good CUT&RUN experiment is the fragment size plot and that you optimize your protocol based on this parameter. With **MACS2** we identified enriched regions, but
we had to remove some noise. We performed some robust peak analysis with **bedtools intersect** and performed a check with a ChIP-Seq experiment to remove some false positives.
Finally, we used **MEME-ChIP** to identify our binding motifs.
