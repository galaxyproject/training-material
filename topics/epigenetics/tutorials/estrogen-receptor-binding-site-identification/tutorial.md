# Introduction


This exercise uses the dataset from the Nature publication by [Ross-Inness et al., 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22217937).
The goal of this article was to identify the binding sites of the Estrogen receptor, a transcription factor known to be associated with different types of breast cancer.

To this end, ChIP-seq was performed in breast cancer cells from 4 patients of different outcomes (good and poor). For each ChIP-seq experiment there is a matching technical control, i.e. there are 8 samples in total:

Patient | Outcome | Treatment
--- | --- | ---
Patient 1 | Good | ChIP ER
Patient 1 | Good | input (no immunoprecipitation step)
Patient 2 | Good | ChIP ER
Patient 2 | Good | input (no immunoprecipitation step)
Patient 3 | Poor | ChIP ER
Patient 3 | Poor | input (no immunoprecipitation step)
Patient 4 | Poor | ChIP ER
Patient 4 | Poor | input (no immunoprecipitation step)

Half of which are the so-called 'input' samples for which the same treatment as the ChIP-seq samples was done except for the immunoprecipitation step.
The input files are used to identify potential sequencing bias, like open chromatin or GC bias.

Because of the long processing time for the large original files, we have downsampled the original data and provide already processed data for subsequent steps.

# Step 1: Quality control and treatment of the sequences

The first step of any ChIP-Seq data analysis is quality control of the raw sequencing data.

It is often necessary to trim sequenced read, for example, to get rid of bases that were sequenced with high uncertainty (= low quality bases).

# Step 2: Mapping of the reads

In order to figure where the sequenced DNA fragments originated from in the genome, the short reads must be aligned to the reference genome. This is equivalent to solving a jigsaw puzzles, but unfortunately, not all pieces are unique. In principle, you could do a BLAST analysis to figure out where the sequenced pieces fit best in the known genome. Aligning millions of short sequences this way may, however, take a couple of weeks.

### Running Bowtie2

Nowadays, there are many read alignment programs for shotgun sequenced DNA, Bowtie2 being one of them.

{: .hands_on}

The read alignment step with bowtie2 resulted in a compressed, binary file (BAM) that is not human-readable. It's like the zipped version of a text file.

We will show you two ways to inspect the file:

1. Visualization using a Genome Browser
2. Converting the binary format into its text file equivalent


## Visualization using a Genome Browser

> <hands-on-title>Visualization of the reads in IGV</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Click on the `display with IGV local` to load the reads into the IGV browser
> 2. Zoom at the start of chromosome 11 (or `chr11:1,562,200-1,591,483`)
{: .hands_on}

The reads have a direction: they are mapped to the forward or reverse strand, respectively. When hovering over a read, extra information is displayed

> <question-title></question-title>
>
> 1. Some reads have colored lines included. What is this?
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> > 1. Try to zoom in in one of those lines and you will see the answer!
> {: .solution }
{: .question}

> <comment-title></comment-title>
> Because the number of reads over a region can be quite large, the IGV browser by default only allows to see the reads that fall into a small window. This behaviour can be changed in the IGV preferences panel.
{: .comment}


## Inspection of the SAM format

As mentioned above, you can convert the binary BAM file into a simple (but large!) text file, which is called a [SAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAM_(file_format)) (Sequence Alignment Map) file.

> <hands-on-title>Conversion into a SAM file</hands-on-title>

>    - "Header options" to `Include header in SAM output`
>
> 2. Inspect the file by clicking on `eye` icon
>
{: .hands_on}

A SAM file is a file with

- A header with the chromosome names and lengths
- A file content as a tabular file with the location and other information of each read found in the FASTQ file and the mapping information

# Step 3: ChIP-seq Quality Control

We already checked the quality of the raw sequencing reads in the first step.
Now we would like to test the quality of the ChIP-seq preparation, to know if your ChIP-seq samples are more enriched than the control (input) samples.

## Correlation between samples

To assess the similarity between the replicates of the ChIP and the input, respectively, it is a common technique to calculate the correlation of
read counts on different regions for all different samples.
We expect that the replicates of the ChIP-seq experiments should be clustered more closely to each other than the replicates of the input sample.
That is, because the input samples should not have enriched regions included - remember the immuno-precipitation step was skiped during the sample preparation.

To compute the correlation between the samples we are going to to use the QC modules of deepTools (http://deeptools.readthedocs.io/), a software package for the QC, processing and analysis of NGS data. Before computing the correlation a time consuming step is required, which is to compute the read coverage over a large number of regions from each BAM file. For this we will use the tool **multiBamSummary** {% icon tool %}.

To do that, we need at first to catch up for all our samples and re-run the previous steps (quality control and mapping) on each sample.
To save time, we already did that and we can now work directly on the BAM files of the 8 samples

## IP strength estimation

To evaluate the quality of the immuno-precipitation step, we can compute the IP strength. It determines how well the signal in the ChIP-seq sample can be differentiated from the background distribution of reads in the control sample. To do that we take the data for one Patient and compare the input sample and the ChIP-seq sample.

> <comment-title></comment-title>

The plotFingerprint tool generates a fingerprint plot. You need to intepret it to know the IP strength. The [deepTools documentation](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/list_of_tools.html) explains it clearly:

# Step 4: Normalization

We would like to know where the binding sites of the estrogen receptor are located. For this we need
to extract which parts of the genome have been enriched (more reads mapped) within the samples that underwent immunoprecipitation.

For the normalization we have two options.

1. Normalization by sequencing depth
2. Normalization by input file


## Generation of coverage files normalized by sequencing depth

We first need to make the samples comparable. Indeed, the different samples have usually a different sequencing depth, i.e. a different number of reads.
These differences can bias the interpretation of the number of reads mapped to a specific genome region.

## Generation of input-normalized coverage files and their visualization

To extract only the information induced by the immunoprecipitation, we normalize for each patient the coverage file for the sample that underwent immunoprecipitation by the coverage file for the input sample. Here we use the tool bamCompare which compare 2 BAM files while caring for sequencing depth normalization.

# Step 5: Detecting enriched regions (peak calling)

The called peak regions can be filtered by, *e.g.* fold change, FDR and region length for further downstream analysis.

# Step 6: Plot the signal on the peaks between samples

Plotting your region of interest will involve using two tools from the **deepTools** suite.
+ computeMatrix : Computes the signal on given regions, using the bigwig coverage files from different samples.
+ plotHeatmap : Plots heatMap of the signals using the computeMatrix output.

ptionally, you can also use `plotProfile`to create a profile plot using to computeMatrix output.

# Additional exercise (if you have finished all above)

## Additional Quality control : GC bias assessment

A common problem of PCR-based protocols is the observation that GC-rich regions tend to be amplified more readily than GC-poor regions.
We need to check that our samples do not have more reads from regions of the genome with high GC.

> <comment-title></comment-title>
> GC bias was for many years a big problem, but recent advances in sample preparation have solved this problem to a degree that you can skip this step more often.

For practical reasons, we will focus here only on one of our BAM files. With real data you should repeat these steps for all your samples.

>   - "Second BAM file (e.g. control sample)" to `patient2_input_good_outcome`, `patient3_input_good_outcome`, `patient4_input_good_outcome`
>
> 2. Perform peak calling again using treatment file : `patient2_ChIP_ER_good_outcome` and control `patient2_input_good_outcome`, using macs2 parameters same as above.
>
> 3. Concatenate the outputs (summits in BED) from `patient1` and `patient2` using `Operate on Genomic Intervals` --> `Concatenate`
>
> 4. Sort the output `Operate on Genomic Intervals` --> `sortBED`
>
> 5. Merge the overlapping intervals using `Operate on Genomic Intervals` --> `MergeBED`
>
> 6. **computeMatrix** {% icon tool %} with the same parameters but:
>    - Regions to plot : select the merged bed from above
>    - Output option : `reference-point`
>    - The reference point for the plotting: `center of region`
>    - Distance upstream of the start site of the regions defined in the region file : `3000`
>    - Distance downstream of the end site of the given regions: `3000`
>
>    With this option, it considers only those genomic positions before (downstream) and/or after (upstream) a reference point (*e.g.* TSS, which corresponds to the annotated gene start in our case)
>
> 7. **plotHeatmap** {% icon tool %} with
>    - "Matrix file from the computeMatrix tool" to the generated matrix
>    - "Show advanced options" to `yes`
>    - "Did you compute the matrix with more than one groups of regions?" to `No, I used only one group`
>    - "Clustering algorithm" to `Kmeans clustering`
> Inspect the output
