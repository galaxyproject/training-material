      The goal of this tutorial is to identify the binding sites of the Estrogen
      receptor, a transcription factor known to be associated with different
      types of breast cancer. This exercise uses the dataset from the Nature
      publication by <a
      href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22217937">Ross-Inness et al.,
      2012</a>. <br><br>To this end, ChIP-seq was performed in breast cancer
      cells from 4 patients of different outcomes (good and poor). For each
      ChIP-seq experiment there is a matching technical control, i.e. there are
      8 samples in total.
    backdrop: true
  - title: Introduction
    content: >-
      Half of which are the so-called ‘input’ samples for which the same
      treatment as the ChIP-seq samples was done except for the
      immunoprecipitation step. The input files are used to identify potential
      sequencing bias, like open chromatin or GC bias. <br><br>Because of the
      long processing time for the large original files, we have downsampled the
      original data and provide already processed data for subsequent steps.

  - title: Mapping of the reads
    content: >-
      In order to figure where the sequenced DNA fragments originated from in
      the genome, the short reads must be aligned to the reference genome. This
      is equivalent to solving a jigsaw puzzles, but unfortunately, not all
      pieces are unique. In principle, you could do a BLAST analysis to figure
      out where the sequenced pieces fit best in the known genome. Aligning
      millions of short sequences this way may, however, take a couple of weeks.

    content: >-
      We already checked the quality of the raw sequencing reads in the first
      step. Now we would like to test the quality of the ChIP-seq preparation,
      to know if your ChIP-seq samples are more enriched than the control
      (input) samples.
    backdrop: true
  - title: Correlation between samples
    content: >-
      To assess the similarity between the replicates of the ChIP and the input,
      respectively, it is a common technique to calculate the correlation of
      read counts on different regions for all different samples. We expect that
      the replicates of the ChIP-seq experiments should be clustered more
      closely to each other than the replicates of the input sample. That is,
      because the input samples should not have enriched regions included -
      remember the immuno-precipitation step was skiped during the sample
      preparation.
    backdrop: true
  - title: Correlation between samples
    content: >-
      To compute the correlation between the samples we are going to to use the
      QC modules of deepTools (http://deeptools.readthedocs.io/), a software
      package for the QC, processing and analysis of NGS data. Before computing
      the correlation a time consuming step is required, which is to compute the
      read coverage over a large number of regions from each BAM file. For this
      we will use the tool <b>multiBamSummary</b>

      <br><br>To do that, we need at first to catch up for all our samples and
      re-run the previous steps (quality control and mapping) on each sample. To
      save time, we already did that and we can now work directly on the BAM
      files of the 8 samples

      We would like to know where the binding sites of the estrogen receptor are
      located. For this we need to extract which parts of the genome have been
      enriched (more reads mapped) within the samples that underwent
      immunoprecipitation.

      <br><br>For the normalization we have two options.

      <ul>
        <li>Normalization by sequencing depth</li>
        <li>Normalization by input file</li>
      </ul>

  - title: Generation of coverage files normalized by sequencing depth
    content: >-
      We first need to make the samples comparable. Indeed, the different
      samples have usually a different sequencing depth, i.e. a different number
      of reads. These differences can bias the interpretation of the number of
      reads mapped to a specific genome region.

      The advanced options may be adjusted, depending of the samples. If your
      ChIP-seq experiment targets regions of broad enrichment, e.g.
      non-punctuate histone modifications, select calling of broad regions. If
      your sample has a low duplication rate (e.g. below 10%), you might keep
      all duplicate reads (tags). Otherwise, you might use the ‘auto’ option to
      estimate the maximal allowed number of duplicated reads per genomic
      location.

        <li>The reference point for the plotting: center of region</li>
        <li>Distance upstream of the start site of the regions defined in the region file : 3000</li>
        <li>Distance downstream of the end site of the given regions: 3000</li>
      </ul>

      With this option, it considers only those genomic positions before
      (downstream) and/or after (upstream) a reference point (e.g. TSS, which
      corresponds to the annotated gene start in our case)
