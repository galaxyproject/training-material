# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

The field of cancer genomics has demonstrated the power of massively parallel sequencing techniques to inform on the genes and specific alterations that drive tumor onset and progression. Although large comprehensive sequence data sets continue to be made increasingly available, data analysis remains an ongoing challenge, particularly for laboratories lacking dedicated resources and bioinformatics expertise. To address this, we have provide training based on  Galaxy tools ewas suite that represent many popular algorithms for detecting somatic genetic alterations from cancer genome and exome data.

This exercise uses the dataset from the Cell publication by Hugo, Willy, et al., 2015 (DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2015.07.061). The goal of this article was to identify differentially methylated regions and positions associated with treatment resistant melanomas.

To this end, Illumina 450K Methylation array was performed in melanoma tumors from example patient pre and post MAPKi and BRAFi treatment with  different outcomes (sensitive and resistant). For each sample there is raw green and red colour arrays containing the summarized bead information generated bythe Illumina 450k scanner, i.e. there are 8 files in total:


The Infinium Methylation Assay 450k uses two different bead types to detect changes in DNA methylation levels. In the figure we can see M - methylated and U - unmethylated bead types. In our study unmethylated and methylated bead signals are reported as green and red colors respectively.

# Preprocessing and  Quality Assessment

Preprocessing and data quality assurance is an important step in Infinium Methylation Assay analysis.

`RGChannelSet` represents two color data with a green and a red channel and can be converted into methylated and unmethylated signals assigned to `MethylSet` or into Beta values build in `RatioSet`. User can convert from `RGChannelSet` into `MethylSet` using the **minfi mset** {% icon tool %} or compute Beta values using **minfi set** {% icon tool %}. The **minfi qc** {% icon tool %} tool extracts and plots the quality control data frame with two columns mMed and uMed which are the medians of `MethylSet` signals (Meth and Unmeth).Comparing them against one another allows user to detect and remove low-quality samples.

# Removing probes affected by genetic variation

Incomplete annotation of genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may affect DNA measurements and interfere results from downstream analysis.

Hansen, J. P. 2014 highly recommende to remove the probes that contain either a SNP at the metylated loci interrogation or at the single nucleotide extension

# DMPs and DMRs Identification

The main goal of the EWAS suite is to simplify the way differentially methylated loci sites are detected. The EWAS suite contains **minfi dmp** {% icon tool %} tool detecting differentially methylated positions (DMPs) with respect to a phenotype covariate, and more complex **minfi dmr** {% icon tool %} solution for finding differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Genomic regions that are differentially methylated between two conditions can be tracked using a bumphunting algorithm. The algorithm first implements a t-statistic at each methylated loci location, with optional smoothing, then groups probes into clusters with a maximum location gap and a cutoff size to refer the lowest possible value of genomic profile hunted by our tool.

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

Epigenetic aberrations which involve DNA modifications give researchers an interest to identify novel non-genetic factors responsible for complex human phenotypes such as height, weight, and disease. To identify methylation changes researchers need to perform complicated and  time consuming computational analysis. Here, the EWAS suite becomes a solution for this inconvenience and provides a simplified downstream analysis available as ready to run pipline in supplementary materials.
