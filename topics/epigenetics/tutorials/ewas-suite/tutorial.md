# Introduction


The field of cancer genomics has demonstrated the power of massively parallel sequencing techniques to inform on genes and specific alterations that drive tumor onset and progression. Although large comprehensive sequence data sets continue to be made increasingly available, data analysis remains an ongoing challenge, particularly for laboratories lacking dedicated resources and bioinformatics expertise. To address this, we have provided training based on Galaxy Infinium Human Methylation BeadChip tool that represents many popular algorithms for detecting somatic genetic alterations from genome and exome data.

![epimechanism](../../images/Epigenetic_mechanisms.jpg "How epigenetics mechanism can effect health (adapted from https://commonfund.nih.gov/epigenomics/figure)")

This exercise uses datasets from the Cell publication by {% cite Hugo2015 %}. with the goal being the identification of differentially methylated regions and positions associated with treatment resistant melanomas.
Datasets include the Infinium Human Methylation BeadChip array performed in melanoma tumors in a sample of patients pre and post MAPKi and BRAFi treatment with different outcomes (sensitive and resistant). For each sample there is raw green (methylated) and red (unmethylated) colour arrays containing the summarised bead information generated by the Infinium Human Methylation BeadChip scanner.

The Infinium Human Methylation BeadChip uses two different bead types to detect changes in DNA methylation levels. In the figure we can see M - methylated and U - unmethylated bead types. In our study unmethylated and methylated bead signals are reported as green and red colors respectively.

Accession  | Sensitivity | Treatment
--- | ---  | ---
GSM1588704 | baseline    | pre-treatment
GSM1588705 | baseline    | pre-treatment
GSM1588706 | resistant   | BRAFi
GSM1588707 | resistant   | BRAFi

The workflow combines 5 main steps, starting with raw intensity data loading (.idat) and then optional preprocessing and normalisation of the data. The next quality control step performs an additional sample check to remove low-quality data, which normalisation cannot detect. The workflow gives the user the opportunity to perform any of these preparation and data cleaning steps, including a highly recommended genetic variation annotation step resulting in single nucleotide polymorphism identification and removal. Finally, the dataset generated through all of these steps can be used to hunt (find) differentially-methylated positions (DMP) and regions (DMR) with respect to a phenotype covariate.

# Raw intensity data loading

The first step of the Infinium Human Methylation BeadChip array analysis is raw methylation data loading (intensity information files for each two colour micro array)

# .idat preprocessing

Preprocessing and data quality assurance is an important step in Infinium Methylation Assay analysis. Idat dataset represents two colour data with a green and a red channel and can be converted into methylated and unmethylated signals or into Beta values. The Infinium Human Methylation BeadChip tool extracts and plots the quality control data frame with two columns mMed and uMed which are the medians of methylation signals (Meth and Unmeth). Comparing them against one another allows users to detect and remove low-quality samples.

![quality_control](../../images/quality_control.png)

> <hands-on-title>Preprocessing</hands-on-title>
> Ilumina methylation array data can be mapped to the genome with or without additional preprocessing methods. Incomplete annotation of genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may affect DNA measurements and disrupt downstream analysis of results.  {% cite Hansen %} It is highly recommended to remove the probes that contain either an SNP at the methylated loci interrogation or at the single nucleotide extension. In this tutorial we will remove probes affected by genetic variation by selecting **(Optional) Preprocessing Method** {% icon tool %}.

# Differentially methylated regions and positions analysis

The main goal of the **Infinium Human Methylation BeadChip** analysis is to simplify the way differentially methylated loci sites are detected. The **Infinium Human Methylation BeadChip** pipeline contains differentially methylated positions (DMPs) detection with respect to a phenotype covariate, and more complex solutions for finding differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Genomic regions that are differentially methylated between two conditions can be tracked using a bumphunting algorithm. The algorithm first implements a t-statistic at each methylated loci location, with optional smoothing, then groups probes into clusters with a maximum location gap and a cutoff size to refer the lowest possible value of genomic profile hunted by our tool.

# Conclusion


Epigenetic aberrations which involve DNA modifications give researchers an interest in identifying novel non-genetic factors responsible for complex human phenotypes such as height, weight, and disease. To identify methylation changes researchers need to perform complicated and time consuming computational analysis. Here, the EWAS suite becomes a solution for this inconvenience and provides a simplified downstream analysis available as a ready to run pipline in supplementary materials.
