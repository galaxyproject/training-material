# Introduction

<!-- This is a comment. -->

The field of cancer genomics has demonstrated the power of massively parallel sequencing techniques to inform on the genes and specific alterations that drive tumor onset and progression. Although large comprehensive sequence data sets continue to be made increasingly available, data analysis remains an ongoing challenge, particularly for laboratories lacking dedicated resources and bioinformatics expertise. To address this, we have provide training based on  Galaxy tools ewas suite that represent many popular algorithms for detecting somatic genetic alterations from cancer genome and exome data.  

This exercise uses the dataset from the Cell publication by Hugo, Willy, et al., 2015 (DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2015.07.061). The goal of this article was to identify differentially methylated regions and positions associated with melanoma MAPKi resistance.

To this end, Illumina 450K Methylation array  was performed in melanoma tumors from example patient pre and post MAPKi and BRAFi treatment with  different outcomes (sensitive and resistant). For each sample there is raw green and red colour arrays containing the summarized bead information generated by the Illumina 450k scanner, i.e. there are 4 files in total:

Accession  | Sensitivity | Treatment
--- | ---  | ---
GSM1588704 | sensitive   | MAPKi
GSM1588705 | sensitive   | MAPKi
GSM1588706 | resistant   | BRAFi
GSM1588707 | resistant   | BRAFi
