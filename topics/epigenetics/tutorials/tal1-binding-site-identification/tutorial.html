                <p>This tutorial uses ChIP-seq datasets from a study published by <span class="citation"><a href="#Wu_2014">Wu <i>et al.</i> 2014</a></span>. The goal of this study was to investigate “the dynamics of occupancy and the role in gene regulation of the transcription factor TAL1, a critical regulator of hematopoiesis, at multiple stages of hematopoietic differentiation.”</p>

<p>To this end, ChIP-seq experiments were performed in multiple mouse cell types including G1E - a GATA-null immortalized cell line derived from targeted disruption of GATA-1 in mouse embryonic stem cells - and megakaryocytes.</p>

<p>This dataset (GEO Accession: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE51338">GSE51338</a>) consists of biological replicate TAL1 ChIP-seq and input control experiments.
Input control experiments are used to identify and remove sampling bias, for example open/accessible chromatin or GC bias.</p>

<p>Because of the long processing time for the large original files, we have downsampled the original raw data files to include only reads that align to chromosome 19 and a subset of interesting genomic loci identified by <span class="citation"><a href="#Wu_2014">Wu <i>et al.</i> 2014</a></span>.</p>

<h1 id="trimming-and-clipping-reads">Trimming and clipping reads</h1>

<p>It is often necessary to trim a sequenced read to remove bases sequenced with high uncertainty (<em>i.e.</em> low-quality bases). In addition, artificial adaptor sequences used in library preparation protocols need to be removed before attempting to align the reads to a reference genome.</p>

<h1 id="aligning-reads-to-a-reference-genome">Aligning reads to a reference genome</h1>

<p>To determine where DNA fragments originated from in the genome, the sequenced reads must be aligned to a reference genome. This is equivalent to solving a jigsaw puzzle, but unfortunately, not all pieces are unique. In principle, you could do a BLAST analysis to figure out where the sequenced pieces fit best in the known genome. Aligning millions of short sequences this way, however, can take a couple of weeks.
Nowadays, there are many read alignment programs for sequenced DNA, BWA being one of them. You can read more about the BWA algorithm and tool in <span class="citation"><a href="#Li_2009">Li and Durbin 2009</a></span>.</p>

<h1 id="assessing-correlation-between-samples">Assessing correlation between samples</h1>

<p>To assess the similarity between the replicates sequencing datasets, it is a common technique to calculate the correlation of read counts for the different samples.</p>

<p>We expect that the replicate samples will cluster more closely to each other than to other samples. We will be use tools from the package deepTools for the next few steps. More information on deepTools can be found <a href="https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/list_of_tools.html">in deepTools’ documentation</a>.</p>

An ideal control (input) with perfect uniform distribution of reads along the genome (<em>i.e.</em> without enrichment in open chromatin etc.) and infinite sequencing coverage should generate a straight diagonal line.

            <li>We expect that the control (input) signal is more or less uniform distributed over the genome (<em>e.g.</em> like the green line in the image above).

<p>Now that BWA has aligned the reads to the genome, we will use the tool MACS2 to identify regions of TAL1 occupancy, which are called “peaks”. Peaks are determined from pileups of sequenced reads across the genome that correspond to where TAL1 binds.</p>

<p>MACS2 will perform two tasks:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Identify regions of TAL1 occupancy (peaks).</li>
  <li>Generate bedGraph files for visual inspection of the data on a genome browser.</li>

<h1 id="inspection-of-peaks-and-aligned-data">Inspection of peaks and aligned data</h1>

<p>It is critical to visualize NGS data on a genome browser after alignment to evaluate the “goodness” of the analysis. Evaluation criteria will differ for various NGS experiment types, but for ChIP-seq data we want to ensure reads from a Treatment/IP sample are enriched at peaks and do not localize non-specifically (like the control/input condition).</p>

<p>MACS2 generates bedGraph and BED files that we will use to visualize read abundance and peaks, respectively, at regions MACS2 determines to be TAL1 peaks using Galaxy’s in-house genome browser, Trackster.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>In an input ChIP-seq file, the expectation is that DNA fragments are uniformly sampled from the genome. This is in contrast to an IP ChIP-seq file where it is expected that certain genomic regions contain more reads (<em>i.e.</em> regions that are bound by the protein that is immunopurified). Therefore, non-uniformity of reads in the input sample could be a result of GC-bias, whereby more GC-rich fragments are preferentially amplified during PCR.</li>
            <li>To answer this question, run the computeGCbias tool as described above and check out the results. What do YOU think? For more examples and information on how to interpret the results, check out the tool usage documentation <a href="https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/computeGCBias.html#background">in deepTools’ documentation</a>.</li>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In this exercise you imported raw Illumina sequencing data, evaluated the quality before and after you trimmed reads with low confidence scores, aligned the trimmed reads, identified TAL1 peaks relative to the negative control (background), and visualized the aligned reads and TAL1 peaks relative to gene structures and positions. Additional, you assessed the “goodness” of the experiments by looking at metrics such as GC bias and IP enrichment.</p>
