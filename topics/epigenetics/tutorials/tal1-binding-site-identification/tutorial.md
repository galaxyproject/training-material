# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

This tutorial uses ChIP-seq datasets from a study published by {% cite Wu_2014 %}. The goal of this study was to investigate "the dynamics of occupancy and the role in gene regulation of the transcription factor TAL1, a critical regulator of hematopoiesis, at multiple stages of hematopoietic differentiation."

To this end, ChIP-seq experiments were performed in multiple mouse cell types including G1E - a GATA-null immortalized cell line derived from targeted disruption of GATA-1 in mouse embryonic stem cells - and megakaryocytes.

This dataset (GEO Accession: [GSE51338](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE51338)) consists of biological replicate TAL1 ChIP-seq and input control experiments.
Input control experiments are used to identify and remove sampling bias, for example open/accessible chromatin or GC bias.

Because of the long processing time for the large original files, we have downsampled the original raw data files to include only reads that align to chromosome 19 and a subset of interesting genomic loci identified by {% cite Wu_2014 %}.

# Quality control

As for any NGS data analysis, ChIP-seq data must be quality controlled before being aligned to a reference genome. For more detailed information on NGS quality control, check out the tutorial [here]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/sequence-analysis).

# Trimming and clipping reads

It is often necessary to trim a sequenced read to remove bases sequenced with high uncertainty (*i.e.* low-quality bases). In addition, artificial adaptor sequences used in library preparation protocols need to be removed before attempting to align the reads to a reference genome.

# Aligning reads to a reference genome

To determine where DNA fragments originated from in the genome, the sequenced reads must be aligned to a reference genome. This is equivalent to solving a jigsaw puzzle, but unfortunately, not all pieces are unique. In principle, you could do a BLAST analysis to figure out where the sequenced pieces fit best in the known genome. Aligning millions of short sequences this way, however, can take a couple of weeks.
Nowadays, there are many read alignment programs for sequenced DNA, BWA being one of them. You can read more about the BWA algorithm and tool [here](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btp324).

# Assessing correlation between samples

To assess the similarity between the replicates sequencing datasets, it is a common technique to calculate the correlation of read counts for the different samples.

We expect that the replicate samples will cluster more closely to each other than to other samples. We will be use tools from the package deepTools for the next few steps. More information on deepTools can be found [here](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/list_of_tools.html).

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Assessing correlation between samples

# Assessing IP strength

>    >
>    > > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
>    > > 1. It shows us how good the ChIP Signal compared to the control signal is. An ideal control (input) with perfect uniform distribution of reads along the genome (*i.e.* without enrichment in open chromatin etc.) and infinite sequencing coverage should generate a straight diagonal line. A very specific and strong ChIP enrichment will be indicated by a prominent and steep rise of the cumulative sum towards the highest rank.
>    > > 2. We expect that the control (input) signal is more or less uniform distributed over the genome (*e.g.* like the green line in the image above). The IP dataset should look more like the red line but it would be better if the values for IP start to increase at around 0.8 on the x-axis.
>    > > 3. The enrichment did not work as it should. Compare the blue line with the red one! For your future experiments: You can never have enough replicates!

# Determining TAL1 binding sites

Now that BWA has aligned the reads to the genome, we will use the tool MACS2 to identify regions of TAL1 occupancy, which are called "peaks". Peaks are determined from pileups of sequenced reads across the genome that correspond to where TAL1 binds.

MACS2 will perform two tasks:
1. Identify regions of TAL1 occupancy (peaks).
2. Generate bedGraph files for visual inspection of the data on a genome browser.

More information about MACS2 can be found in {% cite Zhang_2008 %}.

# Inspection of peaks and aligned data

It is critical to visualize NGS data on a genome browser after alignment to evaluate the "goodness" of the analysis. Evaluation criteria will differ for various NGS experiment types, but for ChIP-seq data we want to ensure reads from a Treatment/IP sample are enriched at peaks and do not localize non-specifically (like the control/input condition).

MACS2 generates bedGraph and BED files that we will use to visualize read abundance and peaks, respectively, at regions MACS2 determines to be TAL1 peaks using Galaxy's in-house genome browser, Trackster.

## Inspection of peaks and aligned data with Trackster

We will import a gene annotation file so we can visualize aligned reads and TAL1 peaks relative to gene features and positions.

# Identifying unique and common TAL1 peaks between stages

We have processed ChIP-seq data from two stages of hematopoiesis and have lists of TAL1-occupied sites (peaks) in both cellular states. The next analysis step is to identify TAL1 peaks that are *shared* between the two cellular states and peaks that are *specific* to either cellular state.

# Generating Input normalized coverage files

We will generate Input normalized coverage (bigWig) files for the ChIP samples, using the bamCompare tool from deepTools2. bamCompare provides multiple options to compare the two files (*e.g.* log2ratio, subtraction). We will use log2 ratio of the ChIP samples over Input.

# Plot the signal on the peaks between samples

Plotting your region of interest will involve using two tools from the deepTools suite:
+ computeMatrix: Computes the signal on given regions, using the bigwig coverage files from different samples.
+ plotHeatmap: Plots heatMap of the signals using the computeMatrix output.

Optionally, you can use plotProfile to create a profile plot using to computeMatrix output.

# Additional optional analyses

## Assessing GC bias

A common problem of PCR-based protocols is the observation that GC-rich regions tend to be amplified more readily than GC-poor regions.

We will now check whether the samples have more reads from regions of the genome with high GC.

>    >
>    > > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
>    > > 1. In an input ChIP-seq file, the expectation is that DNA fragments are uniformly sampled from the genome. This is in contrast to an IP ChIP-seq file where it is expected that certain genomic regions contain more reads (*i.e.* regions that are bound by the protein that is immunopurified). Therefore, non-uniformity of reads in the input sample could be a result of GC-bias, whereby more GC-rich fragments are preferentially amplified during PCR.

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

In this exercise you imported raw Illumina sequencing data, evaluated the quality before and after you trimmed reads with low confidence scores, aligned the trimmed reads, identified TAL1 peaks relative to the negative control (background), and visualized the aligned reads and TAL1 peaks relative to gene structures and positions. Additional, you assessed the "goodness" of the experiments by looking at metrics such as GC bias and IP enrichment.
