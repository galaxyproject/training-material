#Methylation: What is it good for?
- Suppression of repeats
- Gene expression
- Imprinting
- X-chromosome inactivation
- Chromosome stability
- Development
- Changes in cancer
- Changes with age

# For the morbidly curious
####For SE datasets or read number 1 in PE:
- C→T converted read: OT or OB (original strand)
- G→A converted read: CTOT or CTOB (complementary strand)
- C→T converted genome: OT or CTOB (top physical strand)
- G→A converted genome: OB or CTOB (bottom physical strand)
