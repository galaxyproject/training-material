# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

This tutorial provides a companion to the work performed in March 2020 by InformaticsMatters, the Diamond Light Source, and the European Galaxy Team to perform virtual screening on candidate ligands for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (MPro). This work is described [here](https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/cheminformatics).

In this tutorial, you will perform protein-ligand docking to MPro using rDock ({% cite rdock %}) and score the results using two different methods. The same tools will be used as in the original study, but with a smaller dataset.

# Background

Early in March 2020, the Diamond Light Source completed a successful fragment screen on MPro, which provided 55 fragment hits (see their [press release](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19/for-scientists/Main-protease-structure-and-XChem.html) here). In an effort to identify candidate molecules for binding, InformaticsMatters, the XChem group and the European Galaxy team joined forces to construct and execute a Galaxy workflow for performing and evaluating molecular docking on a massive scale.

An initial list of 41,000 candidate molecules was assembled by using the Fragalysis fragment network to elaborate from the initial fragment hits, as described [here](https://diamondlightsource.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FRAG/pages/8323192/The+Astex+Fragment+network). These were used as inputs for the docking and scoring workflow. The workflow consists of the following steps, each of which was carried out using tools installed on the European Galaxy server:
1. Charge enumeration of the 41,000 candidate molecules selected based on the fragment hits.
2. Generation of 3D conformations based on SMILES strings of the candidate molecules.
3. Docking of molecules into each of the MPro structures using rDock.
4. Evaluation of the docking poses using a TransFS, a deep learning approach ({% cite transfs %}) developed by the XChem group and collaborators, and SuCOS scoring ({% cite sucos %}), which compares the poses with the structures of the original fragment hits.

The original study required almost 20 years of CPU time, not counting GPU resources consumed. This is obviously not reproducible as a tutorial. Therefore, we will repeat the workflow with a small library of just 100 molecules, on a single MPro fragment structure. Links will be provided to original Galaxy histories, with notes to explain where and why things were done differently to the tutorial.

# Get data

We require three datasets for the simulation and analysis:
1. A list of 100 ligand candidates. These are the molecules which will be docking into the protein binding site.
2. A PDB file of the receptor MPro protein (without ligand or solvent).
3. A list of fragment hits (17 in total) in SDF format.

> ### {% icon details %} Differences with the original study
>
> Of the initial 55 fragment hits, 17 were chosen for further study. From these, 41,587 compounds were generated using the Fragalysis fragment network for further study. The 100 compounds used in the tutorial are taken from this list.
>
>
> Starting data is available from this Galaxy history: [https://usegalaxy.eu/u/sbray/h/mpro-raw-data](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/sbray/h/mpro-raw-data).
> 
> 
> This history contains 103 files. One of these (`Initial candidates for docking`) contains the 41k candidate compounds in SMILES format. The remaining 102 files (all with names beginning with `Mpro-x...`) provide structural information on the fragment hits - 6 files per hit (hence 17 x 6 = 102). 
>
>
> The identity of the files is as follows:
>
> - the `*_0.mol` files contain the fragment structure in mol format.
> - the `*_0.pdb` files contain the fragment structure in pdb format.
> - the `*_0_apo.pdb` files contain the protein with solvent, but without ligand
> - the `*_0_apo-desolv.pdb` files contain the protein without either solvent or ligand
> - the `*_0_apo-solv.pdb` files contain only solvent
> - the `*_0_bound.pdb` file contain everything (protein, ligand and solvent)
>
> The PDB file of the receptor that we are using is `Mpro-x0195_0_apo-desolv.pdb`. In other words, the structure is derived from just one fragment hit. In the original study, however, all compounds were docked against all of the fragment hit structures.

# Preparation for docking

Before docking, the candidate ligands need to be prepared for docking with the following steps: 1) charge enumeration, 2) generation of three-dimensional structures, and 3) splitting the SD-file into a collection.

> ### {% icon details %} Differences with the original study
>
> This stage is carried out as described here, except of course with the full set of 42,000 compounds. See [here](https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/cheminformatics/1-DockingPrep/) for more details.

## Charge enumeration

Many of the compounds may contain functional groups which can exist in multiple charge states, and this will affect the quality of binding to the receptor dramatically. Therefore, we perform 'charge enumeration', which means that we generate all charge forms of the compounds within a certain pH range.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Charge enumeration
>
> 1. **Enumerate changes** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters:
>    - *"Input molecule data"*: `Candidate SMILES`
>    - *"Minimum pH"*: `4.4`
>    - *"Maximum pH"*: `10.4`
> 2. Rename the output file `Enumerated candidates SMILES`.
>
>    > ### {% icon comment %} Comment

>    > The **Enumerate charges** {% icon tool %} tool is based on the Dimorphite-DL program. ({% cite Ropp2019 %})
>    {: .comment}
>
{: .hands_on}

The output is another SMILES file, with several hundred entries.

## Generate three-dimensional conformations

So far our list of enumerated candidate compounds is still in SMILES format; we need to produce three-dimensional structures in SDF format for docking. This can be done with the **Compound conversion** {% icon tool %} tool.

If you are not familiar with SMILES and SDF formats, consult the introductory [protein-ligand docking tutorial](../cheminformatics/tutorial.html) for more details.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Convert to SDF format
>
> 1. **Compound conversion** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters:
>    - *"Molecular input file"*: `Enumerated candidates` dataset.
>    - *"Output format"*: `MDL MOL format (sdf, mol)`
>        - *"Generate 3D coordinates"*: `Yes`
> 2. Rename the output file `Enumerated candidates SDF`.

## Splitting the SD-file into a collection

The next stage is to split the SD-file with the candidate ligands into a set of smaller SD-files.


> ### {% icon question %} Questions
>
> Why is splitting the file necessary?
>
> > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
> >
> > The rDock tool performs one docking at a time (more technically: the task is not parallelized, as it uses only a single CPU). Therefore, splitting the large SD-file into many small files allows the work to be carried out by multiple Galaxy jobs in parallel, so it completes faster.
> >
> > In the original study, this kind of parallelization was absolutely essential because of the enormous dataset; at some points, there were 5,000 docking jobs running concurrently on the European Galaxy server. Even on the much smaller scale of this tutorial, we can speed things up considerably using this trick.

>        - *"Method to allocate records to new files"*: `Alternate output files`

# Active site preparation

The active site also needs to be prepared for docking, using the following steps: 1) conversion to MOL2 format, and 2) generation of the active site using the **rbcavity** {% icon tool %} tool.

> ### {% icon details %} Differences with the original study
>
> This stage was carried out as described here. However, it was repeated for each of the fragment hit structures, not just the `Mpro-x0195_0_apo-desolv.pdb` file used here. See [here](https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/cheminformatics/2-ActiveSitePrep/) for more details.
{: .details}

## Convert protein structure to MOL2 format

The receptor file we are using is in PDB format, but the rDock tool we use for docking requires an input in MOL2 format. Therefore, we first convert the file.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Conversion to MOL2 format
>
> 1. **Compound conversion** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters:
>    - *"Molecular input file"*: `Receptor PDB` dataset.
>    - *"Output format"*: `Sybyl Mol2 format (mol2)`
> 2. Rename the output file `Receptor MOL2`.
>
>
{: .hands_on}

## Generate Frankenstein ligand

For docking with rDock, a file needs to be created defining the active site. This requires two input files - one for the protein and one for the ligand. We want an active site generation that takes into account the features of all 17 fragments, and therefore need to generate a 'Frankenstein ligand' which possesses the properties of all the fragments. A very simple Galaxy tool is available for this.

> ### {% icon question %} Questions
>
> What is a 'Frankenstein ligand' and why do we need it?
>
> > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
> >
> > The Frankenstein ligand combines the atoms of all the fragments and therefore occupies the entire space of the binding site. Therefore, it is the best choice for cavity definition. See the [information provided by InformaticsMatters](https://www.informaticsmatters.com/blog/2018/11/23/cavities-and-frankenstein-molecules.html) for more details.

{: .hands_on}

## Generate active site definition

The active site can now be generated using the **rbcavity** {% icon tool %} tool, which requires the receptor in MOL2 format as input as well as a single reference ligand in Mol/SDF format. We use the Frankenstein ligand as the reference.

# Docking and scoring

Docking and scoring are now performed, using the following steps: 1) docking using rDock, 2) recombining the results into a single SDF file, 3) TransFS scoring, and 4) SuCOS scoring.

> ### {% icon details %} Differences with the original study
>
> This section in the original study differed from this tutorial in the following ways:
> 1. Docking was performed on over 100,000 enumerated candidates, rather than the 300 used here.
> 2. 25 different poses were generated per candidate, rather than 5, as in this tutorial.
> 3. Because of the large number of poses to score (more than a million), the scoring steps were parallelized by splitting into collections. This is skipped in the tutorial.
> 4. The entire process was repeated 17 times, using a different fragment hit as the receptor structure each time.
> See [here](https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/cheminformatics/3-Docking/) and [here](https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/cheminformatics/3-Docking/) for more details. A full list of Galaxy histories generated is listed [here](https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/cheminformatics/Histories/).

## Docking with rDock

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Docking
>
> 1. **rDock docking** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters:
>    - *"Receptor"*: `Receptor MOL2`
>    - *"Active site"*: `Active site`
>    - *"Ligands"*: `Split file` collection
>    - *"Number of dockings"*: `5`
>    - *"Number of best poses"*: `5`
>
>    > ### {% icon comment %} Comment
>    >
>    > For more information about docking, check out the [introductory tutorial](../cheminformatics/tutorial.html). It uses a different tool, AutoDock Vina, rather than rDock, but the general principles are the same.

{: .hands_on}

## Collapse collection to a single file 

Having created a collection to parallelize the docking procedure, we can now recombine the results to a single file.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Collapse collection
>
> 1. **Collapse Collection** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters:
>    - *"Collection of files to collapse into single dataset"*: Output of docking step
> 2. Rename to `Docked poses SDF`.
>
{: .hands_on}

The output file should contain around 1,900 docked poses in SDF format.

## Pose scoring with TransFS

In this step, we carry out scoring of the poses using TransFS. This is a deep learning approach developed at the University of Oxford, employing augmentation of training data with incorrectly docked ligands to prompt the model to learn from protein-ligand interactions. ({% cite transfs %})

The TransFS scoring returns a value (saved as `<TransFSScore>` in the SDF file) between 0 (poor) and 1 (good).

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: TransFS scoring
>
> 1. **XChem TransFS pose scoring** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters:
>    - *"Receptor"*: `Receptor PDB`
>    - *"Ligands"*: `Docked poses SDF`
>    - *"Distance to waters"*: `2`
>
{: .hands_on}

## Pose scoring with SuCOS

This step involves scoring of the poses from each molecule against the original fragment screening hit ligands using the SuCOS MAX shape and feature overlay algorithm. ({% cite sucos %}) The conformation and position of the poses are compared to known structures (i.e. the fragment hits) to determine a score.

SuCOS scoring returns a value (saved as `<Max_SuCOS_Score>` in the SDF file) between 0 (poor) and 1 (good).

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: SuCOS scoring
>
> 1. **Max SuCOS score** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters:
>    - *"Ligands to be scored"*: Output of the TransFS step
>    - *"Set of clusters to score against"*: `Hits SDF`
> 2. Rename the output file to `Scored poses`.
{: .hands_on}

# Compound selection

The aim of the original study was to select 500 candidate molecules for synthesis and experimental study. In order to do this, the data for all fragment hits had to be combined (i.e. so that each compound was assigned the lowest score from all the fragments). The resulting table was then compared with a list of compounds available from [Enamine](https://enamine.net/) and [Chemspace](https://chem-space.com/) and the 500 highest scoring matching compounds were selected for purchase.

This step is skipped in the tutorial, as only 100 compounds were tested, using only a single fragment hit structure. If you want, though, check out the [history](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/timdudgeon/h/top-500-enamine--chemspace-bb) and [workflow](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/timdudgeon/w/filter-results) used.

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

This tutorial guided you through docking and scoring of a small set of compounds to the MPro protein. Hopefully, you have a better understanding of how docking can be practically used, as well as how the original study was performed.
