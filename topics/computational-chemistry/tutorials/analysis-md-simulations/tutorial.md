# Introduction


Molecular dynamics simulations return highly complex data. The Cartesian positions of each atom of the system (thousands or even millions) are recorded at every time step of the trajectory; this may again be thousands to millions of steps in length. Therefore, some kind of further analysis is needed to extract useful information from the data.

In this tutorial, we illustrate some of the analytical tools able to investigate conformational changes by analysis of a typical short protein simulation, such as for CBH1.

There are other analysis tools available; you are encouraged to try these out too.

# Analysis with BIO3D

We'll carry out some basic analysis by calculating RMSD, RMSF and PCA. The tools use the [Bio3D package](http://thegrantlab.org/bio3d), developed by the [Grant lab](http://thegrantlab.org/).


## RMSD

RMSD, or root-mean-square deviation, is a standard measure of structural distance between coordinates. It measures the average distance between a group of atoms (e.g. backbone atoms of a protein). If we calculate RMSD between two sets of atomic coordinates - for example, two time points from the trajectory - the value is a measure of how much the protein conformation has changed. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation_of_atomic_positions) provides more information.

## RMSF

The root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) measures the average deviation of a particle (e.g. a protein residue) over time from a reference position (typically the time-averaged position of the particle). Thus, RMSF analyzes the portions of structure that are fluctuating from their mean structure the most (or least).

## PCA

Principal component analysis (PCA) converts a set of correlated observations (movement of all atoms in protein) to a set of principal components which are linearly independent (or uncorrelated). Mathematically, it is a transformation of the data to a new coordinate system, in which the first coordinate represents the greatest variance, the second coordinate represents the second most variance, and so on.

You can read more about PCA on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis). In a nutshell, PCA takes a complex dataset with many variables and tries to distill the variables down to a few 'principal components' which still preserve most of the differences between the data.

In summary:
- The **PCA** {% icon tool %} tool will calculate and return a PCA to determine the relationship between statistically meaningful conformations (major global motions) sampled during the trajectory. THe tool returns several images of the PCA and the raw data in tab-separated format.
- The **PCA visualization** {% icon tool %} tool will carry out PCA and return a trajectory of the selected principle component. This trajectory is useful for visualisation and further investigating the interesting modes and changes that occur within a selected principle component.

> > Here, PCA shows the statistically meaningful conformations in the CBH1 trajectory. The principal motions within the trajectory and the vital motions needed for conformational changes can be identified. Two distinct groupings along the PC1 plane, indicating a non-periodic conformational change, are identified. The groupings along the PC2 and PC3 planes do not completely cluster separately, implying that these global motions are periodic. The PC1 is linked to an active site motion that limits the motion to a key glycosidic bond.
