# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

Molecular dynamics (MD) is a method to simulate molecular motion by iterative application of Newton's laws of motion. It is often applied to large biomolecules such as proteins or nucleic acids.

Multiple packages exist for performing MD simulations. One of the most popular is the open-source GROMACS, which is the subject of this tutorial. Other MD packages which are also wrapped in Galaxy are [NAMD]({% link topics/computational-chemistry/tutorials/md-simulation-namd/tutorial.md %}) and CHARMM (available in the [docker container](https://github.com/scientificomputing/BRIDGE)).

This is a introductory guide to using GROMACS ({% cite abraham15 %}) in Galaxy to prepare and perform molecular dynamics on a small protein. For the tutorial, we will perform our simulations on hen egg white lysozyme.

# Process

Prior to performing simulations, a number of preparatory steps need to be executed.

The process can be divided into multiple stages:
 1. Setup (loading data, solvation i.e. addition of water and ions)
 2. Energy minimization of the protein
 3. Equilibration of the solvent around the protein (with two ensembles, NVT and NPT)
 4. Production simulation, which produces our trajectory.

The trajectory is a binary file that records the atomic coordinates at multiple time steps, and therefore shows the dynamic motion of the molecule. Using visualization software, we can display this trajectory as a film displaying the molecular motion of the protein. We will discuss each step making up this workflow in more detail.


# Getting data
To perform simulation, an initial PDB file is required. This should be 'cleaned' of solvent and any other non-protein atoms. Solvent will be re-added in a subsequent step.

A prepared file is available via Zenodo. Alternatively, you can prepare the file yourself. Download a PDB structure file from the [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/) and remove the unwanted atoms using the grep text processing tool. This simply removes the lines in the PDB file that refer to the unwanted atoms.

> ### {% icon details %} Background: What is the PDB (Protein Data Bank) and format?
>
> The Protein Data Bank (PDB) format contains atomic coordinates of biomolecules and provides a standard representation for macromolecular structure data derived from X-ray diffraction and NMR studies. Each structure is stored under a four-letter accession code. For example, the PDB file we will use is assigned the code [1AKI](https://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1AKI).

> More resources:

>  -  Multiple structures are stored and can be queried at [https://www.rcsb.org/](https://www.rcsb.org/)
>  - Documentation describing the PDB file format is available from the wwPDB at [http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format.php](http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format.php).

## Lysozyme
The protein we will look at in this tutorial is hen egg white [lysozyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysozyme), a widely studied enzyme which is capable of breaking down the polysaccharides of many bacterial cell walls. It is a small (129 residues), highly stable globular protein, which makes it ideal for our purposes.

# Setup

The **GROMACS initial setup** {% icon tool %} tool uses the PDB input to create three files which will be required for MD simulation.

Firstly, a topology for the protein structure is prepared. The topology file contains all the information required to describe the molecule for the purposes of simulation - atom masses, bond lengths and angles, charges. Note that this automatic construction of a topology is only possible if the building blocks of the molecules (i.e. amino acids in the case of a protein) are precalculated for the given force field. A force field and water model must be selected for topology calculation. Multiple choices are available for each; we will use the OPLS/AA force field and SPC/E water model. Secondly, a GRO structure file is created, storing the structure of the protein. Finally, a 'position restraint file' is created which will be used for NVT/NPT equilibration. We will return to this later.

In summary, the initial setup tool will:
- create a 'topology' file
- convert a PDB protein structure into a GRO file, with the structure centered in a simulation box (unit cell)
- create a position restraint file

After these files have been generated, a further step is required to define a simulation box (unit cell) in which the simulation can take place. This can be done with the **GROMACS structure configuration** {% icon tool %} tool. It also defines the unit cell 'box', centered on the structure. Options include box dimensions and shape; here, while a cuboidal box may be most intuitive, rhombic dodecahedron is the most efficient option, as it can contain the protein using the smallest volume, thus reducing the simulation resources devoted to the solvent.

# Solvation

The next stage is protein solvation, performed using **GROMACS solvation and adding ions** {% icon tool %}. Water molecules are added to the structure and topology files to fill the unit cell. At this stage sodium or chloride ions are also automatically added to neutralize the charge of the system. In our case, as lysozyme has a charge of +8, 8 chloride anions are added.

# Energy minimization

To remove any steric clashes or unusual geometry which would artificially raise the energy of the system, we must relax the structure by running an energy minimization (EM) algorithm.

Here, and in the later steps, two options are presented under 'Parameter input'. Firstly, the default setting, which we will use for this tutorial, requires options to be selected through the Galaxy interface. Alternatively, you can choose to upload an MDP (molecular dynamics parameters) file to define the simulation parameters. Using your own MDP file will allow greater customization, as not all parameters are implemented in Galaxy (yet); however, it requires a more advanced knowledge of GROMACS. Description of all parameters can be found [here](http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2018/user-guide/mdp-options.html).

# Equilibration

At this point equilibration of the solvent around the solute (i.e. the protein) is necessary. This is performed in two stages: equilibration under an NVT ensemble, followed by an NPT ensemble. Use of the NVT ensemble entails maintaining constant **n**umber of particles, **v**olume and **t**emperature, while the NPT ensemble maintains constant **n**umber of particles, **p**ressure and **t**emperature. (The NVT ensemble is also known as the isothermal-isochoric ensemble, while the NPT ensemble is also known as the isothermal-isobaric ensemble).

For equilibration, the protein must be held in place while the solvent is allowed to move freely around it. This is achieved using the position restraint file we created in system setup. When we specify this restraint, protein movement is not totally forbidden, but is energetically punished.

## NVT equilibration
Firstly, we perform equilibration using classical NVT dynamics.

>    - *"Number of steps for the NVT simulation"*: `50000`
>    - *"Generate detailed log"*: `Yes`
{: .hands_on}

## NPT equilibration
Having stabilized the temperature of the system with NVT equilibration, we also need to stabilize the pressure of the system. We therefore equilibrate again using the NPT (constant number of particles, pressure, temperature) ensemble.

Note that we can continue where the last simulation left off (with new parameters) by using the checkpoint (CPT) file saved at the end of the NVT simulation.

# Workflow

A GROMACS workflow is provided for this tutorial. Overall, the workflow takes a PDB (Protein Data Bank) structure file as input and returns a MD trajectory.

![GROMACS workflow]({% link topics/computational-chemistry/images/workflow_gromacs.png %} "The basic GROMACS workflow")

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

After completing the steps, or running the workflow, we have successfully produced a trajectory (the xtc file) which describes the atomic motion of the system. This can be viewed using molecular visualization software or analysed further; please visit the visualization and [analysis]({% link topics/computational-chemistry/tutorials/analysis-md-simulations/tutorial.md %}) tutorials for more information.
