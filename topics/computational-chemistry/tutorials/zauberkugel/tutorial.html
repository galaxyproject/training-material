                <p>Historically, the pharmacophore concept was formulated in 1909 by the German physician and Nobel prize laureate Paul Ehrlich (<span class="citation"><a href="#Ehrlich1909">Ehrlich 1909</a></span>). According to the <a href="https://iupac.org/">International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)</a>, a pharmacophore is defined as “an ensemble of steric and electronic features that is necessary to ensure the optimal supramolecular interactions with a specific biological target and to trigger (or block) its biological response” (<span class="citation"><a href="#Wermuth1998">Wermuth <i>et al.</i> 1998</a></span>). Starting from the cocrystal structure of a non-covalent protein–ligand complex (e.g. Figure 1), pharmacophore perception involves the extraction of the key molecular features of the bioactive ligand at the protein–ligand contact interface into a single model (<span class="citation"><a href="#Moumbock2019">Moumbock <i>et al.</i> 2019</a></span>). These pharmacophoric features mainly include: H-bond acceptor (HACC or A), H-bond donor (HDON or D), lipophilic group (LIPO or H), negative center (NEGC or N), positive center (POSC or P), and aromatic ring (AROM or R) moieties. Moreover, receptor-based excluded spheres (EXCL) can be added in order to mimic spatial constraints of the binding pocket (Figure 2). Once a pharmacophore model has been generated, a query can be performed either in a forward manner, using several ligands to search for novel putative hits of a given target, or in a reverse manner, by screening a single ligand against multiple pharmacophore models in search of putative protein targets (<span class="citation"><a href="#Steindl2006">Steindl <i>et al.</i> 2006</a></span>).</p>

<p>Bioactive compounds often bind to several target proteins, thereby exhibiting polypharmacology. However, experimentally determining these interactions is laborious, and structure-based virtual screening of bioactive compounds could expedite drug discovery by prioritizing hits for experimental validation. The recently reported ePharmaLib (<span class="citation"><a href="#Moumbock2021">Moumbock <i>et al.</i> 2021</a></span>) dataset is a library of 15,148 e-pharmacophores modeled from solved structures of pharmaceutically relevant protein–ligand complexes of the screening Protein Data Bank (sc-PDB, <span class="citation"><a href="#Desaphy2014">Desaphy <i>et al.</i> 2014</a></span>). ePharmaLib can be used for target fishing of phenotypic hits, side effect predictions, drug repurposing, and scaffold hopping.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will perform pharmacophore-based target prediction of a bioactive ligand known as staurosporine (Figure 2) with the ePharmaLib subset representing <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> protein targets (138 pharmacophore models) and the open-source pharmacophore alignment program <a href="https://anaconda.org/bioconda/align_it">Align-it</a>, formerly known as PHARAO (<span class="citation"><a href="#Taminau2008">Taminau <i>et al.</i> 2008</a></span>).</p>

  <p>Staurosporine (PDB hetID: <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/ligand/STU">STU</a>) is an indolocarbazole secondary metabolite isolated from several bacteria of the genus Streptomyces. It displays diverse biological activities such as anticancer and antiparasitic activities (<span class="citation"><a href="#Nakano2009">Nakano and Ōmura 2009</a></span>).</p>

  <p>The simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) is a string notation for describing the 2D chemical structure of a compound. It only states the atoms present in a compound and the connectivity between them. As an example, the SMILES string of acetone is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CC(=O)C</code>. SMILES strings can be imported by most molecule editors and converted into either two-dimensional structural drawings or three-dimensional models of the compounds, and vice versa. For more information on how the notation works, please consult the <a href="http://opensmiles.org/opensmiles.html">OpenSMILES specification</a> or the description provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

    <p>Staurosporine is a chiral molecule possessing four chiral centers. The SMILES notation allows the specification of configuration at tetrahedral centers and double bond geometry, by marking atoms with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@@</code>. These are structural features that cannot be specified by connectivity alone, and therefore SMILES which encode this information are termed isomeric SMILES. A notable feature of these rules is that they allow rigorous partial specification of chirality.</p>

        <p>It is recommended to use the default settings, except for the number of conformers which should be changed to 100. As a rule of thumb, a threshold of 100 conformers appropriately represents the conformational flexibility of a compound with less than 10 rotatable bonds. The output SDF (structure data file) format encodes three-dimensional atomic coordinates of each conformer, separated by lines containing four dollar signs (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$$$</code>).</p>

    <p>Staurosporine is a fused 8-ring system with only two rotatable bonds, due to its planar aromatic 5-ring indolocarbozole scaffold which confers a high structural rigidity upon the compound, i.e. it exists in relatively few energetically distinct 3D conformations.</p>

<p>In this step, the ligand conformer dataset (SDF format) is converted on-the-fly to a pharmacophore dataset (PHAR format) and simultaneously aligned to the individual pharmacophores of the ePharmaLib dataset in a batch mode with Align-it (<span class="citation"><a href="#Taminau2008">Taminau <i>et al.</i> 2008</a></span>). The pharmacophoric alignments and thus the predicted targets are ranked in terms of a scoring metric: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tversky index</code> = [0,1]. The higher the Tversky index, the higher the likelihood of the predicted protein–ligand interaction.</p>

  <p>The top-ranked protein of our target prediction experiment is <em>4mvf-STU-CDPK2_PLAFK</em> (Figures 1 &amp; 2) with a Tversky index = 0.73. The general observation that can be made from this ranking of protein hits is the high self-retrieval rate of known targets, which demonstrates the high prediction accuracy of the method. The higher the Tversky index, the higher the likelihood of the predicted protein–ligand interaction; with a value of 0.5 corresponding to a 50% likelihood.</p>
