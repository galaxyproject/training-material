# Introduction

Food contamination with pathogens is a major burden on our society. In the year 2019, foodborne pathogens caused 137 hospitalisations in Germany [(BVL 2019)](https://www.bvl.bund.de/SharedDocs/Berichte/10_BELA_lebensmittelbed_Krankheitsausbruechen_Dtl/Jahresbericht2019.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4). Globally, they affect an estimated 600 million people a year and impact socioeconomic development at different levels. These outbreaks are mainly due to _Salmonella spp._ followed by _Campylobacter spp._ and Noroviruses, as studied by the [__Food safety - World Health Organization (WHO)__](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241565165).

During the investigation of a foodborne outbreak, a microbiological analysis of the potentially responsible food vehicle is performed in order to detect the responsible pathogens and identify the contamination source. By default, the [__European Regulation (EC)__](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:338:0001:0026:EN:PDF) follows ISO standards to detect bacterial pathogens in food: pathogens are detected and identified by **stepwise cultures** on selective media and/or **targeting specific genes with real-time PCRs**. The current gold standard is Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) or Multiple-Locus Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA) to characterize the detected strains. These techniques have some disadvantages.

**Whole Genome Sequencing** (WGS) has been proposed as an alternative. With just one sequencing run, we can:
- detect all genes
- run phylogenetic analysis to link cases
- get information on antimicrobial resistance genes, virulence, serotype, resistance to sanitizers, root cause, and other critical factors in one assay, including historical reference to pathogen emergence.

WGS is more than a surveillance tool and was recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for surveillance and outbreak investigation. WGS still requires isolation of the targeted pathogen, which is a time-consuming process, the execution is not always straightforward, nor the success is guaranteed. **Sequencing methods without prior isolation could solve this issue**.

The evolution of sequencing techniques in the last decades has made the development of shotgun metagenomic sequencing possible, *i.e.* the **direct sequencing of all DNA present in a sample**. This approach gives an overview of the genomic composition of all cells in the sample, including the food source itself, the microbial community, and any possible pathogens and their complete genetic information without the need for prior isolation. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of shotgun metagenomics to identify and characterize pathogens and their functional characteristics (*e.g.* virulence genes) in naturally contaminated or purposefully spiked food samples.

The currently available studies used Illumina sequencing, generating short reads. Longer read lengths, generated by third-generation sequencing platforms such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), make it **easier and more practical to identify strains with fewer reads**. MinION (from Oxford Nanopore) is a portable, real-time device for ONT sequencing. Several proof-of-principle studies have shown the **utility of ONT long-read sequencing from metagenomic samples for pathogen identification** ({% cite CIUFFREDA20211497 %}).

{% snippet faqs/galaxy/sequencing_nanopore.md %}

To identify and track foodborne pathogens using long-read metagenomic sequencing, different samples of potentially contaminated food (at different time points or different locations) are prepared, DNA is extracted and sequenced using MinION (ONT). The generated sequencing data then need to be processed using bioinformatics tools.

In this tutorial, we will be presenting a series of Galaxy workflows whose main goals are to:
1. **agnostically detect pathogens** (What exactly is this pathogen and what virulence factors does it carry?) from data extracted directly (without prior cultivation) from a potentially contaminated sample (e.g. food like chicken, beef, etc.) and sequenced using Nanopore
2. **compare different samples to trace** the possible source of contamination

To illustrate how to process such data, we will use datasets generated by [Biolytix](https://www.biolytix.ch/) with the following approach:

![From left to right: Biolytix logo. Chicken + milk. An arrow going to the right toward Chicken + milk and a syringe with "Contamination with known pathogens" written below. An arrow going to the right toward an Eppendorf tube with "DNA extraction" written below,  An arrow going to the right toward a qPCR machine, and another arrow over the qPCR toward a Nanopore sequencing. ](./images/Biolytix_Workflow_Sequencing.png)

Food samples, here chicken, are spiked with known pathogens, here:
- _Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica_  in the sample named `Barcode 10 Spike 2`
- _Salmonella enterica subsp. houtenae_ in the sample named `Barcode 11 Spike 2b`

DNA in the samples is extracted, analyzed with qPCR, and sequenced via Nanopore. We start the tutorial from raw data generated by Nanopore.

# Prepare Galaxy and data
Any analysis should get its own Galaxy history. So let's start by creating a new one:

> <hands-on-title>Data upload</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Create a new history for this analysis

>
> 2. Rename the history
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/histories_rename.md %}
>
{: .hands_on}

Before we can begin any Galaxy analysis, we need to upload the input data: FASTQ files with the sequenced samples.

In this tutorial, we can offer 2 versions:
- A short version, running prebuilt workflows
- A long version, going step-by-step

{% include _includes/cyoa-choices.html option1="Short Version" option2="Long Version" default="Short-Version" %}


# Pre-Processing

Before starting any analysis, it is always a good idea to assess the quality of your input data and to discard poor quality base content by trimming and filtering reads.

<div class="Short-Version" markdown="1">

In this section we will run a Galaxy workflow that performs the following tasks with the following tools:
1. Assess the reads quality before and after preprocessing it using [__FastQC__](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), [__NanoPlot__](https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot) and  [__MultiQC__](https://multiqc.info/) ({% cite Ewels2016 %})
2. Trimming and filtering reads by length and quality using [__Porechop__](https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop) and **Fastp** ({% cite Chen2018 %})
3. Remove all possible hosts sequences e.g. chicken, cow, etc. using [__Kraken2__](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/) ({% cite Wood2014 %}) with the [__Kalamari__](https://github.com/lskatz/Kalamari) database, and table manipulation tools, which are **Filter Tabular** ({% cite Johnson2018 %}) and **Filter Sequence By ID** ({% cite Cock2013 %}) to separate the sequences into host and non-host sequences before moving on, in the next section, with the non-host sequences.

We will run all these steps using a single workflow, then discuss each step and the results in more detail.

> <hands-on-title>Pre-Processing</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. **Import the workflow** into Galaxy
>    - Copy the URL (e.g. via right-click) of [this workflow]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.dir }}workflows/nanopore_preprocessing.ga) or download it to your computer.
>    - Import the workflow into Galaxy
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/workflows_import.md %}
>
> 2. Run **Workflow 1:  Nanopore Datasets - Pre-Processing** {% icon workflow %} using the following parameters
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/workflows_run.md %}
>
>    - {% icon param-files %} *"1: Nanopore reads of a sample"*: FastQ files
>
>      {% snippet faqs/galaxy/tools_select_multiple_datasets.md  %}
>
>    - *"2: Host to Remove Specifier"*: `^.*Gallus|Homo|Bos.*$`
>
>      We specify here the taxonomic names of the hosts so we can filter reads assigned to these hosts. To be generic, we remove here:
>      - Human (`Homo`)
>      - Chicken (`Gallus`)
>      - Beef (`Bos`)
>
>      If the contaminated food would be known to come from a different source and may, thus, include other host genomes, you could change the value here.
>
{: .hands_on}

The workflow will take a little while to complete. Once tools have completed, the results will be available in your history for viewing. Note that only the most important outputs will be visible; intermediate files are hidden by default.

While you are waiting for the workflow to complete, please continue reading in the next section(s) where we will go into a bit more detail about what happens at each step of the workflow we launched and examine the results.

## Quality Control and preprocessing

During sequencing, errors are introduced, such as incorrect nucleotides being called. These are due to the technical limitations of each sequencing platform. Sequencing errors might bias the analysis and can lead to a misinterpretation of the data. **Sequence quality control is therefore an essential first step in your analysis.**

In this tutorial we use similar tools as described in the tutorial ["Quality control"]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.md %}), but more specific to Nanopore data:

- Quality control with
    - [__FastQC__](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) generates a web report that will aid you in assessing the quality of your data
    - [__NanoPlot__](https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot) plotting tool for long read sequencing data and alignments

## Host read filtering

Generally, we are not interested in the food (host) sequences, rather only those originating from the pathogen itself. It is an important to get rid of all host sequences and to only retain sequences that might include a pathogen, both in order to speed up further steps and to avoid host sequences compromising the analysis.

In this tutorial, we know the samples come from __chicken__ meat spiked with **_Salmonella_** so we already know what will we get as the host and the main pathogen.

In this tutorial we use:
1. Assign reads to taxa using **Kraken2** ({% cite Wood2014 %}) and **Kalamari**, a database of completed assemblies for metagenomics-related tasks used widely in contamination and host filtering

# Taxonomy Profiling

In this section we would like to identify the different organisms found in our samples by assigning taxonomy levels to the reads starting from the kingdom level down to the species level and visualize the result. It's important to check what might be the species of a possible pathogen to be found, it gets us closer to the investigation as well as discovering possible multiple food infections if any existed.

{% snippet topics/metagenomics/faqs/taxon.md %}

In the previous section we ran **Kraken2** along with the **Kalamari** database, which is also a kind of taxonomy profiling but the database used is designed to include all possible host sequences. In the following part, we run **Kraken2** again; but this time with one of its built-in databases, **Standard PlusPF**, which can give us more insight into pathogen candidate species than **Kalamari**. You can test this yourself by comparing reports of both **Kraken2** runs.

> <details-title>Kraken2 and the k-mer approach for taxonomy classification</details-title>
>
> In the $$k$$-mer approach for taxonomy classification, we use a database containing DNA sequences of genomes whose taxonomy we already know. On a computer, the genome sequences are broken into short pieces of length $$k$$ (called $$k$$-mers), usually 30bp.
>
> **Kraken** examines the $$k$$-mers within the query sequence, searches for them in the database, looks for where these are placed within the taxonomy tree inside the database, makes the classification with the most probable position, then maps $$k$$-mers to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all genomes known to contain the given $$k$$-mer.
>
> ![Kraken2](../../images/metagenomics-nanopore/kmers-kraken.jpg "Kraken sequence classification algorithm. To classify a sequence, each k-mer in the sequence is mapped to the lowest common ancestor (LCA, i.e. the lowest node) of the genomes that contain that k-mer in the database. The taxa associated with the sequence's k-mers, as well as the taxa's ancestors, form a pruned subtree of the general taxonomy tree, which is used for classification. In the classification tree, each node has a weight equal to the number of k-mers in the sequence associated with the node's taxon. Each root-to-leaf (RTL) path in the classification tree is scored by adding all weights in the path, and the maximal RTL path in the classification tree is the classification path (nodes highlighted in yellow). The leaf of this classification path (the orange, leftmost leaf in the classification tree) is the classification used for the query sequence. Source: {% cite Wood2014 %}")

In order to view the taxonomy profiling produced by **Kraken2** tool, there are a lot of tools to be used afterwards such as **Krona pie chart**, however too many species were detected to be shown by this tool. For that reason, we have chosen the **Phinch visualization** interactive tool as it contains multiple visualization plots, it is interactive alowing you to choose between different parameters, you can visualize each taxonomic level on its own, you can have the metadata of the samples represented along with the taxonomic visualization, download all plots for publications and a lot of other benefits. For later, you can check out [__Pavian__](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/4/1303/5573755) tool as well it can replace **Phinch visualization** with similar outputs.

**Phinch visualization** needs a **BIOM** file format as an input, and for that we need the [__Kraken-Biom__](https://github.com/smdabdoub/kraken-biom)  tool to convert the **Kraken2** tabular output into a Biom file.

# Gene based pathogenic identification

With taxonomy profiling, we identified some bacterial species. But we want to be sure they are pathogenic, by **looking for genes known to be linked to pathogenicity or to the pathogenecity character** of the organim:

- [**Virulence Factor (VF)**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/virulence-factor): gene products, usually proteins, involved in pathogenicity. By identifiying them we can call a pathogen and its severity level
- [**Antimicrobial Resistance genes (AMR)**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/antibiotic-resistance-genes).

    These type of genes have three fundamental mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance that are enzymatic degradation of antibacterial drugs, alteration of bacterial proteins that are antimicrobial targets, and changes in membrane permeability to antibiotics, which will lead to not altering the target site and spread throughput the pathogenic bacteria decreasing the overall fitness of the host.

To look for these genes and determine the strain of the bacteria we are testing for pathogenicity we use **Multilocus Sequence Typing** approach and dedicated [pubMLST datases](https://pubmlst.org/) database:

1. Genome assembly to get contigs, i.e. longer sequences, using **metaflye** ({% cite flye %})  then assembly polishing using [__medaka consensus pipeline__](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) and visualizing the assembly graph using **Bandage Image** ({% cite Wick2015 %})
2. Generate an **MLST** report with **MLST** tool that scans genomes against PubMLST schemes
3. Generate reports with **AMR** genes and **VF** using [__ABRicate__](https://github.com/tseemann/abricate) 

As outputs, we will get our **FASTA** and **Tabular** files to track genes and visualize our pathogenic identification. For that we will need one more file to create a report and we can upload it directly:

## Assembly

To identify VF or AMR genes, it is better to assemble reads into longer seuqences or contigs, that can be then used to search databases for the presence of any pathogenic gene:

- Assembly of long-read metagenomic data using **metaflye** or **Flye**.

## Multilocus Sequence Typing

**MLST** tool is used to scan the [pubMLST](https://pubmlst.org/) database against PubMLST typing schemes. It's one of the analyses that you can perform on your dataset to determine the allele IDs, you can also detect novel alleles. This step is not essential to identify pathogens and track them in the remainder of this tutorial, however we wanted to show some of the analysis that one can use Galaxy in to understand more about the dataset, as well as identifying the strain that might be a pathogen or not.

## Antimicrobial Resistance Genes

Now, to search **AMR** genes among our samples' contigs, we run **ABRicate** and choose the [__NCBI Bacterial Antimicrobial Resistance Gene Database (AMRFinderPlus)__](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6811410/) from the advanced options of the tool. The tool checks if there is an AMR found or not, if found then in which contig it is, its location on the contig, what the name of the exact product is, what substance it provides resistance against and a lot of other information regarding the found **AMR**.

## Virulence Factor identification

In this step we return back to the main goal of the tutorial where we want to identify the pathogens: **identify if the bacteria found in our samples are pathogenic bacteria or not**. One of the ways to do that is to identify if the sequences include genes with a [Virulence Facor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2646308/) or not, such that if the samples include gene(s) with a Virulence Factor then it for sure is a pathogen.

> <comment-title>Definitions</comment-title>
>
> **Bacterial Pathogen**: A bacterial pathogen is usually defined as any bacterium that has the capacity to cause disease. Its ability to cause disease is called pathogenicity.
>
> **Virulence**: Virulence provides a quantitative measure of the pathogenicity or the likelihood of causing a disease.
>
> **Virulence Factors**: Virulence factors refer to the properties (i.e., gene products) that enable a microorganism to establish itself on or within a host of a particular species and enhance its potential to cause disease. Virulence factors include bacterial toxins, cell surface proteins that mediate bacterial attachment, cell surface carbohydrates and proteins that protect a bacterium, and hydrolytic enzymes that may contribute to the pathogenicity of the bacterium.

# SNP based pathogenic identification

Now we would like to identify pathogens with a third approach based on variant and [single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) calling](https://genome.sph.umich.edu/w/images/e/e6/Seqshop_may_2015_day2_snp_lecture_v2.pdf): comparison of reads to a targeted reference genome, and call the differences between sample reads and reference genomes to identify variants.

For example, if we want to check whether our samples include [_Campylobacter_ pathogenic strains](https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/index.html) or not, we will map our samples against the reference genome of the _Campylobacter_ species. Variants in specific positions on the genome are queried to judge if these variations would indicate a pathogen or not.

This approach also allows identification of novel alleles and possible **new variants of the pathogen**.

Using this approach, we also build the consensus genome of each sample, so we can later build a phylogenetic tree of all samples' full genomes and have an insight into events that occurred during the evolution of same or different species in the samples.

In this training, we are testing _Salmonella enterica_, with different strains of which our samples were spiked. So we will now upload to our history the reference genome of [_S. enterica_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=txid99287[Organism:exp]) we originally obtained from the [National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

## Variant Calling or SNP Calling

To identify variants, we

1. **Map reads to the reference genome** of the species of the pathogen we want to test our samples against using **Minimap2** ({% cite Li2017Minimap2 %}) as our datasets are from a Nanopore:

    <div class="Long-Version" markdown="1">

    </div>

2. **Identify variants and single nucleotide variants** using **Clair3** ({% cite Zheng2021 %}), which is designed specifically for Nanopore datasets and giving better results than other variant calling tools, as well as being new and up-to-date.

    > <comment-title></comment-title>
    > [__Medaka consensus tool__ and __medaka variant tool__](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) can be also used instead of **Clair3**, they give similar results but they are much slower then **Clair3** and offer fewer options.

    {: .hands-on}

    </div>

    The output is a VCF file. VCF is the standard file format for storing variation data, with different columns:
    - `#CHROM`: Chromosome
    - `POS`: Co-ordinate - The start coordinate of the variant.
    - `ID`: Identifier
    - `REF`: Reference allele - The reference allele is whatever is found in the reference genome. It is not necessarily the major allele.
    - `ALT`: Alternative allele - The alternative allele is the allele found in the sample you are studying.
    - `QUAL`: Score - Quality score out of 100.
    - `FILTER`: Pass/fail - If it passed quality filters.
    - `INFO`: Further information - Allows you to provide further information on the variants. Keys in the INFO field can be defined in header lines above thetable.
    - `FORMAT`: Information about the following columns - The GT in the FORMAT column tells us to expect genotypes in the following columns.
    - `Individual identifier (optional)` - The previous column told us to expect to see genotypes here. The genotype is in the form "0\|1", where 0 indicates the reference allele and 1 indicates the alternative allele, i.e it is heterozygous. The vertical pipe "\|" indicates that the genotype is phased, and is used to indicate which chromosome the alleles are on. If this is a slash (/) rather than a vertical pipe, it means we don’t know which chromosome they are on.

## Consensus Genome Building

For further anaylsis we have included one more step in this section, where we build the full genome of our samples.

This consensus genome can be used later to compare and relate samples together based on their full genome. In cases such as SARS-CoV2, it is important to do so in order to discover new outbreaks. In this example of the training, it is not really important to draw a tree of the full genomes of the samples as _Salmonella_ does not have such a speedy outbreak as SARS-CoV2 does. However, we decided to include it in the workflow for any further analysis of the users, if needed.

For this step we run [__bcftools consensus__](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html) ({% cite Li20092 %}).

In this last section, we would like to show how to aggregate results and use the results to help tracking pathogenes among samples by:

1. Drawing a presence-absence heatmap of the identified **VF** genes within all samples to visualize in which samples these genes can be found.
2. Drawing a [phylogenetic tree](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/phylogenetic-tree) for each pathogenic gene detected, where we will relate the contigs of the samples together where this gene is found.

With these two types of visualizations we can have an overview of all samples and the genes, but also how samples are related to each other, which common pathogenic genes they share. Given the time of the sampling and the location one can easily identify using these graphs, where and when the contamination has occurred among the different samples.

## Heatmap

A heatmap is one of the visualization techniques that can give you a complete overview of all the samples together and whether or not a certain value exists. In this tutorial, we use the heatmap to visualize all samples aside and check which common bacteria pathogen genes are found in samples and which is only found in one of them.

We use **Heatmap w ggplot** tool along with other tabular manipulating tools to prepare the tabular files.

## Phylogenetic Tree building

Phylogenetic trees are nice ways to track all the bacterial pathogen genes one by one in all samples. So we will have a tree for every found gene, this tree will indicate which contigs the gene is found in all samples and relating these contigs together based on their topology. With such trees we can identify on which location of the sequences from the sample genome the pathogentic gene is found and whether it is at the same or a different location as the other samples. We can also see how many samples have these genes in common and accordingly track our contamination.

For the phylogenetic trees, for each bacteria pathogen gene found in the samples we use **ClustalW** ({% cite Larkin2007 %}) for [Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/multiple-sequence-alignment) needed before constructing a phylogenetic tree, for the tree itself we use **FASTTREE** and **Newick Display** ({% cite Dress2008 %}) to visualize it.

<div class="Long-Version" markdown="1">

To get the sequence to align, we need to extract the sequences of the VFs in the contigs:
