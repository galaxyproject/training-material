The abbreviation (i.e. the genus) is the first word in the [list of possible hosts](https://github.com/lskatz/Kalamari/blob/master/src/Kalamari_v3.9.1.tsv). The names are the scientific names for species, which would be shown on the taxonomy tree if you would look up the common name (i.e. bovine) on Wikipedia.
