## Understanding our input data

In this tutorial we use the [dataset generated by the Schloss lab](https://mothur.org/wiki/Analysis_examples) to illustrate
[their MiSeq SOP](https://www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP).

They [describe the experiment](https://www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP#Logistics) as follows:

*"The Schloss lab is interested in understanding the effect of normal variation in the gut microbiome on host health. To that end,
we collected fresh feces from mice on a daily basis for 365 days post weaning. During the first 150 days post weaning (dpw),
nothing was done to our mice except allow them to eat, get fat, and be merry. We were curious whether the rapid change in
weight observed during the first 10 dpw affected the stability microbiome compared to the microbiome observed between days
140 and 150."*

![Experiment setup](../../images/experiment_setup.png)

To speed up analysis for this tutorial, we will use only a subset of this data. We will look at a single mouse at 10 different
time points (5 early, 5 late). In order to assess the error rate of the analysis pipeline and experimental setup, the Schloss lab
additionally sequenced a mock community with a known composition (genomic DNA from 21 bacterial strains). The sequences used
for this mock sample are contained in the file `HMP_MOCK.v35.fasta`

> ### {% icon comment %} Dataset naming scheme
> For this tutorial, you are given 10 pairs of files. For example, the following pair of files:<br />
>  `F3D0_S188_L001_R1_001.fastq`<br />
>  `F3D0_S188_L001_R2_001.fastq`
>
> The first part of the file name indicates the sample; `F3D0` here signifies that this sample was obtained from Female 3 on Day 0.
> The rest of the file name is identical, except for `_R1` and `_R2`, this is used to indicate the forward and reverse reads
> respectively.

Now that's a lot of files to manage. Luckily Galaxy can make life a bit easier by allowing us to create
**dataset collections**. This enables us to easily run tools on multiple datasets at once.

Since we have **paired-end** data, each sample consist of two separate fastq files, one containing the
forward reads, and one containing the reverse reads. We can recognize the pairing from the file names,
which will differ only by `_R1` or `_R2` in the filename. We can tell Galaxy about this paired naming
convention, so that our tools will know which files belong together. We do this by building a **List of Dataset Pairs**

# Quality Control
{% include topics/metagenomics/tutorials/mothur-miseq-sop/switch_tutorial.md section="quality-control" %}

For more information on the topic of quality control, please see our training materials
[here]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/index.md %}).

Before starting any analysis, it is always a good idea to assess the quality of your input data and improve it
where possible by trimming and filtering reads. The mothur toolsuite contains several tools to assist with this task.
We will begin by merging our reads into contigs, followed by filtering and trimming of reads based on quality score
and several other metrics.

## Create contigs from paired-end reads

In this experiment, paired-end sequencing of the ~253 bp V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was performed.
The sequencing was done from either end of each fragment. Because the reads are about 250 bp in length, this results in a
significant overlap between the forward and reverse reads in each pair. We will combine these pairs of reads into *contigs*.

![Merging into contigs](../../images/16S_merge_contigs.png)

The **Make.contigs** tool creates the contigs, and uses the paired collection as input. **Make.contigs**
will look at each pair, take the reverse complement reverse read, and then determine the overlap between the
two sequences. Where an overlapping base call differs between the two reads, the quality score is used to determine
the consensus base call. A new quality score is derived by combining the two original quality scores in both of
the reads for all the overlapping positions.


> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Combine forward and reverse reads into contigs
>
> - **Make.contigs** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - {% icon param-select %} *"Way to provide files"*: `Multiple pairs - Combo mode`
>   - {% icon param-collection %} *"Fastq pairs"*: the collection you just created
>   - Leave all other parameters to the default settings
>
{: .hands_on}


This step combined the forward and reverse reads for each sample, and also combined
the resulting contigs from all samples into a single file. So we have gone from a paired
collection of 20x2 FASTQ files, to a single FASTA file. In order to retain information about
which reads originated from which samples, the tool also output a *group file*. View that
file now, it should look something like this:

```
M00967_43_000000000-A3JHG_1_1101_10011_3881     F3D0
M00967_43_000000000-A3JHG_1_1101_10050_15564    F3D0
M00967_43_000000000-A3JHG_1_1101_10051_26098    F3D0
[..]
```

Here the first column contains the read name, and the second column contains the sample name.


## Data Cleaning

{% if include.short %}

Next, we want to improve the quality of our data. To this end we will run a workflow that performs the following steps:

1. **Filter by length** \\
   We know that the V4 region of the 16S gene is around 250 bp long. Anything significantly longer
   was likely a poorly assembled contig. We will remove any contigs longer than 275 base pairs using the **Screen.seqs** {% icon tool %} tool.
2. **Remove low quality contigs** \\
   We will also remove any contigs containing too many ambiguous base calls.
3. **Deduplicate sequences** \\
   Since we are sequencing many of the same organisms, there will likely be many identical contigs. To speed up downstream analysis we will determine the set of unique contigs using **Unique.seqs** {% icon tool %}.

{% else %}
As the next step, we want to improve the quality of our data. But first, let's get a feel of our dataset:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Summarize data

>
{: .hands_on}

The `summary` output files give information per read. The `logfile` outputs also contain some summary
statistics:

```
             Start    End        NBases     Ambigs   Polymer  NumSeqs

75%-tile:    1        253        253        0        5        114271

 # of Seqs:   152360
```

In this dataset:

* Almost all of the reads are between 248 and 253 bases long.
* 2,5% or more of our reads had ambiguous base calls (`Ambigs` column).
* The longest read in the dataset is 502 bases.
* There are 152,360 sequences.

Our region of interest, the V4 region of the 16S gene, is only around 250 bases long. Any reads significantly longer than this expected value likely did not
assemble well in the **Make.contigs** step. Furthermore, we see that 2,5% of our reads had between 6 and 249
ambiguous base calls (`Ambigs` column). In the next steps we will clean up our data by removing these
problematic reads.

We do this data cleaning using the `Screen.seqs` tool, which removes

1. sequences with ambiguous bases (`maxambig`) and
2. contigs longer than a given threshold (`maxlength`).

## Optimize files for computation

Microbiome samples typically contain a large numbers of the same organism, and therefore we expect
to find many identical sequences in our data. In order to speed up computation, we first determine
the unique reads, and then record how many times each of these different reads was observed in
the original dataset. We do this by using the **Unique.seqs** tool.

{: .hands_on}

Here we see that this step has greatly reduced the size of our sequence file; not only will this speed up further computational
steps, it will also greatly reduce the amount of disk space (and your Galaxy quota) needed to store all the intermediate files generated during
this analysis. This **Unique.seqs** tool created two files, one is a FASTA file containing only the unique sequences,
and the second is a so-called *names file*. This names file consists of two columns, the first contains the sequence names
for each of the unique sequences, and the second column contains all other sequence names that are identical to the representative
sequence in the first column.

```
name          representatives
read_name1    read_name2,read_name,read_name5,read_name11
read_name4    read_name6,read_name,read_name10
read_name7    read_name8
...
```

To recap, we now have the following files:

- a FASTA file containing every distinct sequence in our dataset (the *representative* sequences)
- a *names file* containing the list of duplicate sequences
- a *group file* containing information about the samples each read originated from


To further reduce file sizes and streamline analysis, we can use the **Count.seqs** tool to combine
the *group file* and the *names file* into a single *count table*.


> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Generate count table
>
> - **Count.seqs** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - {% icon param-file %} *"name"*: the `names` output from **Unique.seqs** {% icon tool %}
>   - *"Use a Group file"*: `yes`
>   - {% icon param-file %} *"group"*: the `group file` we created using the **Screen.seqs** {% icon tool %}
{: .hands_on}

{% endif %}

Have a look at the *count_table* output from the **Count.seqs** {% icon tool %}, it summarizes the number of times each unique sequence was observed across each of the samples. It will look something like this:

```

# Sequence Alignment

For more information on the topic of alignment, please see our training materials

We are now ready to align our sequences to the reference. This is an important

Have a look at the summary output (log file):

```

Minimum:    1250     10693    250     0        3        1

Median:     1968     11550    252     0        4        64437
75%-tile:   1968     11550    253     0        5        96655
97.5%-tile: 1968     11550    253     0        6        125651
Maximum:    1982     13400    270     0        12       128872
Mean:       1967.99  11550    252.462 0        4.36693
# of unique seqs:   16426
total # of seqs:    128872
```


The `Start` and `End` columns tell us that the majority of reads aligned between positions 1968 and 11550,
which is what we expect to find given the reference file we used. However, some reads align to very different positions,
which could indicate insertions or deletions at the terminal ends of the alignments or other complicating factors.

Also notice the `Polymer` column in the output table. This indicates the average homopolymer length. Since we know that
our reference database does not contain any homopolymer stretches longer than 8 reads, any reads containing such
long stretches are likely the result of PCR errors and we would be wise to remove them.

Next we will clean our data further by removing poorly aligned sequences and any sequences with long
homopolymer stretches.


## More Data Cleaning

To ensure that all our reads overlap our region of interest, we will:

1. Remove any reads not overlapping the region V4 region {% unless include.short %}(position 1968 to 11550){% endunless %} using **Screen.seqs** {% icon tool %}.
2. Remove any overhang on either end of the V4 region to ensure our sequences overlap *only* the V4 region, using **Filter.seqs** {% icon tool %}.
3. Clean our alignment file by removing any columns that have a gap character (`-`, or `.` for terminal gaps) at that position in every sequence (also using **Filter.seqs** {% icon tool %}).
4. Group near-identical sequences together with **Pre.cluster** {% icon tool %}. Sequences that only differ by one or two bases at this point are likely to represent sequencing errors rather than true biological variation, so we will cluster such sequences together.
{% if include.short %} 5. Remove Sequencing artefacts known as *chimeras* (discussed in next section). {% endif %}

Your resulting alignment (`filtered fasta` output) should look something like this:

```

These are all our representative reads again, now with additional alignment information.

In the log file of the **Filter.seqs** step we see the following additional information:

```
Length of filtered alignment: 376
Number of columns removed: 13049
Length of the original alignment: 13425
Number of sequences used to construct filter: 16298
```

From this log file we see that while our initial alignment was 13425 positions wide, after filtering the overhangs
(`trump` parameter) and removing positions that had a gap in every aligned read (`vertical` parameter), we have
trimmed our alignment down to a length of 376.

Because any filtering step we perform might lead to sequences no longer being unique, we deduplicate our data by re-running
the **Unique.seqs** tool:

### Pre-clustering

The next step in cleaning our data, is to merge near-identical sequences together. Sequences that only differ
by around 1 in every 100 bases are likely to represent sequencing errors, not true biological variation. Because
our contigs are ~250 bp long, we will set the threshold to 2 mismatches.

## Chimera Removal

{% unless include.short %}
We have now thoroughly cleaned our data and removed as much sequencing error as we can. Next, we will look
at a class of sequencing artefacts known as *chimeras*.
{% endunless %}

During PCR amplification, it is possible that two unrelated templates are combined to form a sort of hybrid sequence,
also called a *chimera*. Needless to say, we do not want such sequencing artefacts confounding our results. We'll do
this chimera removal using the `VSEARCH` algorithm {% cite Rognes2016 %} that is called within mothur, using the
**Chimera.vsearch** {% icon tool %} tool.

Have a look at the FASTA output from **Pre.cluster**, it should looks something like this:

```
>M00967_43_000000000-A3JHG_1_1101_13234_1983

```

We see that these are our contigs, but with extra alignment information. The filtering steps have removed any positions which had a gap symbol in all reads of the dataset.

This command will split the data by sample and check for chimeras. The recommended

# Taxonomic Classification
{% include topics/metagenomics/tutorials/mothur-miseq-sop/switch_tutorial.md section="taxonomic-classification" %}

Now that we have thoroughly cleaned our data, we are finally ready to assign a taxonomy to our sequences.

We will do this using a Bayesian classifier (via the **Classify.seqs** {% icon tool %} tool) and a mothur-formatted [training
set provided by the Schloss lab](https://www.mothur.org/wiki/RDP_reference_files) based on the RDP (Ribosomal Database Project, {% cite Cole2013 %}) reference taxonomy.

{% include topics/metagenomics/tutorials/mothur-miseq-sop/background_reference_taxonomies.md %}


## Removal of non-bacterial sequences

Despite all we have done to improve data quality, there may still be more to do:
there may be 18S rRNA gene fragments or 16S rRNA from Archaea, chloroplasts, and mitochondria
that have survived all the cleaning steps up to this point. We are generally not interested in these sequences
and want to remove them from our dataset.

The following step is only possible if you have co-sequenced a mock community with your samples. A mock community is a sample
of which you know the exact composition and is something we recommend to do, because it will give you an idea of how
accurate your sequencing and analysis protocol is.

The mock community in this experiment was composed of genomic DNA from 21 bacterial strains. So in a perfect world, this is
exactly what we would expect the analysis to produce as a result.

First, let's extract the sequences belonging to our mock samples from our data:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: extract mock sample from our dataset
>
> - **Get.groups** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - {% icon param-file %} *"group file or count table"*: the `count table` from **Remove.lineage** {% icon tool %}
>   - {% icon param-select %} *"groups"*: `Mock`
>   - {% icon param-file %} *"fasta"*: `fasta` output from **Remove.lineage** {% icon tool %}
>   - {% icon param-check %} *"output logfile?"*: `yes`
>
{: .hands_on}

In the log file we see the following:

```
Selected 58 sequences from your fasta file.
Selected 4046 sequences from your count file
```

The Mock sample has 58 unique sequences, representing a total of 4,046 total sequences.

The **Seq.error** tool measures the error rates using our mock reference. Here we align
the reads from our mock sample back to their known sequences, to see how many fail to match.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Assess error rates based on a mock community
> - **Seq.error** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - {% icon param-file %} *"pick.fasta"*: the `fasta` output from **Get.groups** {% icon tool %}
>   - {% icon param-file %} *"reference"*: `HMP_MOCK.v35.fasta` file from your history
>   - {% icon param-file %} *"count"*: the `count table` from **Get.groups** {% icon tool %}
>   - {% icon param-check %} *"output log?"*: `yes`
>
{: .hands_on}

In the log file we see something like this:

```
Overall error rate:    6.5108e-05
Errors    Sequences
0    3998
1    3
2    0
3    2
4    1
[..]
```

That is pretty good! The error rate is only 0.0065%! This gives us confidence that the rest of the samples
are also of high quality, and we can continue with our analysis.


### Cluster mock sequences into OTUs

We will now estimate the accuracy of our sequencing and analysis pipeline by clustering the Mock sequences into OTUs,
and comparing the results with the expected outcome.

Open the rarefaction output (dataset named `sobs` inside the `rarefaction curves` output collection), it should look
something like this:

```
numsampled	0.03-	lci-	hci-
1	1.0000	1.0000	1.0000
100	18.0240	16.0000	20.0000
200	19.2160	17.0000	22.0000
300	19.8800	18.0000	22.0000
400	20.3600	19.0000	22.0000

[..]

3000	30.4320	28.0000	33.0000
3100	30.8800	28.0000	34.0000
3200	31.3200	29.0000	34.0000
3300	31.6320	29.0000	34.0000
3400	31.9920	30.0000	34.0000
3500	32.3440	30.0000	34.0000

4000	33.8560	33.0000	34.0000
4046	34.0000	34.0000	34.0000

```


When we use the full set of 4060 sequences, we find 34 OTUs from the Mock community; and with
3000 sequences, we find about 31 OTUs. In an ideal world, we would find exactly 21 OTUs. Despite our
best efforts, some chimeras or other contaminations may have slipped through our filtering steps.

{% include topics/metagenomics/tutorials/mothur-miseq-sop/background_rarefaction.md %}

Now that we have assessed our error rates we are ready for some real analysis.


# OTU Clustering
{% include topics/metagenomics/tutorials/mothur-miseq-sop/switch_tutorial.md section="otu-clustering" %}


In this tutorial we will continue with an OTU-based approach, for the phylotype and phylogenic
approaches, please refer to the [mothur wiki page](https://www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP).


{% include topics/metagenomics/tutorials/mothur-miseq-sop/background_otus.md %}


{% if include.short %}
We will now repeat the OTU clustering we performed on our mock community for our real datasets. We use a slightly different workflow because these tools are faster for larger datasets. We will also normalize our data by subsampling to the level of the sample with the lowest number of sequences in it.

{% else %}

### Remove Mock Sample

Now that we have cleaned up our data set as best we can, and assured ourselves of the quality of our sequencing
pipeline by considering a mock sample, we are almost ready to cluster and classify our real data. But
before we start, we should first remove the Mock dataset from our data, as we no longer need it. We do this using
the **Remove.groups** tool:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Remove Mock community from our dataset
>
> - **Remove.groups** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - {% icon param-select %} *"Select input type"*: `fasta , name, taxonomy, or list with a group file or count table`
>   - {% icon param-file %} *"group or count table"*: the `pick.count_table` output from **Remove.lineage** {% icon tool %}

>   - {% icon param-file %} *"taxonomy"*: the `pick.taxonomy` output from **Remove.lineage** {% icon tool %}
>
{: .hands_on}

### Cluster sequences into OTUs

There are several ways we can perform clustering. For the Mock community, we used the traditional approach of
using the **Dist.seqs** and **Cluster** tools. Alternatively, we can also use the **Cluster.split** tool. With
this approach, the sequences are split into bins, and then clustered with each bin.  Taxonomic information is used to guide this process.
The Schloss lab have [published results](https://www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP#OTUs) showing that if you split at the level of Order or Family, and cluster to a 0.03
cutoff, you'll get just as good of clustering as you would with the "traditional" approach. In addition, this approach
is less computationally expensive and can be parallelized, which is especially advantageous when you have large
datasets.

We'll now use the **Cluster** tool, with `taxlevel` set to `4`, requesting that clustering be done at the *Order* level.

{: .hands_on}

Examine {% icon galaxy-eye %} the `taxonomy` output of **Classify.otu** {% icon tool %}. This is a collection, and the different levels of taxonomy are shown in the names of the collection elements. In this example we only calculated one level, 0.03. This means we used a 97% similarity threshold. This threshold is commonly used to differentiate at *species level*.

Opening the taxonomy output for level 0.03 (meaning 97% similarity, or *species* level) shows a file structured like the following:

```
OTU       Size    Taxonomy
..
Otu0008	5260	Bacteria(100);"Bacteroidetes"(100);"Bacteroidia"(100);"Bacteroidales"(100);"Rikenellaceae"(100);Alistipes(100);

..
```

The first line shown in the snippet above indicates that Otu008 occurred 5260 times, and that all of the
sequences (100%) were binned in the genus *[Alistipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alistipes)*.

Before we continue, let's remind ourselves what we set out to do. Our original question was about the stability of

# Diversity Analysis

Species diversity is a valuable tool for describing the ecological complexity of a single sample (alpha diversity)

and many different metrics have been proposed to quantify diversity by {% cite Finotello2016 %}.

## Alpha diversity


In order to estimate alpha diversity of the samples, we first generate the *rarefaction curves*. Recall that
rarefaction measures the number of observed OTUs as a function of the subsampling size.

{% include topics/metagenomics/tutorials/mothur-miseq-sop/background_rarefaction.md %}


{% if include.short %}

We will use a plotting tool to visualize the rarefaction curves, and use **Summary.single** {% icon tool %} to calculate a number of different alpha diversity metrics on all our samples.

>
{: .hands_on}

{% else %}


We calculate rarefaction curves with the **Rarefaction.single** {% icon tool %} tool:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Calculate Rarefaction
> - **Rarefaction.single** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - {% icon param-file %} *"shared"*: the `shared file` from **Make.shared** {% icon tool %}
{: .hands_on}

Note that we used the default diversity measure here (*sobs*; observed species richness), but there are many
more options available under the *calc* parameter. The mothur wiki describes some of these calculators
[here](https://mothur.org/wiki/Calculators).

Examine the rarefaction curve output.

```
numsampled    0.03-F3D0    lci-F3D0    hci-F3D0    0.03-F3D1   ...
1              1.0000       1.0000      1.0000      1.0000
100           41.6560      35.0000     48.0000     45.0560
200           59.0330      51.0000     67.0000     61.5740
300           70.5640      62.0000     79.0000     71.4700
400           78.8320      71.0000     87.0000     78.4730
500           85.3650      77.0000     94.0000     83.9990
...
```

This file displays the number of OTUs identified per amount of sequences used (`numsampled`). What we would like
to see is the number of additional OTUs identified when adding more sequences reaching a plateau. Then we know
we have covered our full diversity. This information would be easier to interpret in the form of a graph.
Let's plot the rarefaction curve for a couple of our sequences:


> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Plot Rarefaction
>
> - **Plotting tool - for multiple series and graph types** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - *"Plot Title"*: `Rarefaction`
>   - *"Label for x axis"*: `Number of Sequences`
>   - *"Label for y axis"*: `Number of OTUs`
>   - *"Output File Type"*: `PNG`
>   - {% icon param-repeat %} Click on **Insert Series**,
>     - {% icon param-collection %} *"Dataset"*: rarefaction curve collection
>     - *"Header in first line?"*: `Yes`
>     - *"Column for x axis"*: `Column 1`
>     - *"Column for y-axis"*: `Column 2` and `Column 5` and every third column until the end (we are
>       skipping the low confidence and high confidence interval columns)
>
{: .hands_on}

{% endif %}

View the rarefaction plot output. From this image can see that the rarefaction curves for all samples have started to level
off so we are confident we cover a large part of our sample diversity:

![Rarefaction curves](../../images/rarefaction_curves.png)

{% unless include.short %}

Finally, let's use the **Summary.single** tool to generate a summary report.  The following step
will randomly subsample down to 2389 sequences, repeat this process 1000 times, and report several metrics:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Summary.single
>
> - **Summary.single** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters

>   - *"size"*: `2389`
{: .hands_on}

{% endunless %}


View the `summary` output from **Summary.single** {% icon tool %}. This shows several alpha diversity metrics:
- [sobs](https://www.mothur.org/wiki/Sobs): observed richness (number of OTUs)
- [coverage](https://mothur.org/wiki/Coverage): Good's coverage index
- [invsimpson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#Simpson_index): Inverse Simpson Index
- [nseqs](https://www.mothur.org/wiki/Nseqs): number of sequences

```

There are a couple of things to note here:
* The differences in diversity and richness between early and late time points is small.
* All sample coverage is above 97%.

There are many more diversity metrics, and for more information about the different calculators available in mothur, see [the mothur wiki page](https://mothur.org/wiki/Calculators)

We could perform additional statistical tests (e.g. ANOVA) to confirm our feeling that there is no significant difference based on sex or early vs. late, but this is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

## Beta diversity

Beta diversity is a measure of the similarity of the membership and structure found between *different* samples.
The default calculator in the following section is *thetaYC*, which is the [Yue & Clayton theta similarity
coefficient](http://csyue.nccu.edu.tw/2005communicationindex.pdf). We will also calculate the [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) (termed `jclass` in mothur).

{% if include.short %}

In the following workflow we will:
- Calculate pairwise distances between samples using the *thetaYC* calculator (**Dist.shared** {% icon tool %})
- Create a **Venn diagram** to show the number of overlapping OTUs between 4 of our samples
- Create a **heatmap** of the intersample similarities (**Heatmap.sim** {% icon tool %})
- Create **pylogenetic tree** showing the relatedness of samples (**Newick Display** {% icon tool %})

{: .hands_on}


{% else %}
We calculate this with the **Dist.shared** tool, which will rarefy our data.

{: .hands_on}

{% endif %}

Look at some of the resulting heatmaps (you may have to download the SVG images first). In all of these
heatmaps the red colors indicate communities that are more similar than those with black colors.

For example this is the heatmap for the `thetayc` calculator (output `thetayc.0.03.lt.ave`):

![Heatmap for the thetayc calculator](../../images/heatmap.sim_thetayc.png)

and the jclass calulator (output `jclass.0.03.lt.ave`):

![Heatmap for the jclass calculator](../../images/heatmap.sim_jclass.png)


{% unless include.short %}

When generating Venn diagrams we are limited by the number of samples that we can analyze simultaneously.
Let's take a look at the Venn diagrams for the first 4 time points of female 3 using the **Venn** tool:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Venn diagram
>
> - **Venn** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - {% icon param-collection %} *"OTU Shared"*: output from **Sub.sample** {% icon tool %} (collection)
>   - *"groups"*: `F3D0,F3D1,F3D2,F3D3`
{: .hands_on}

This generates a 4-way Venn diagram and a table listing the shared OTUs.

{% endunless %}

Examine the Venn diagram:

![Venn diagram and table with shared OTUs](../../images/venn.png)

This shows that there were a total of 180 OTUs observed between the 4 time points. Only 76 of those OTUs were
shared by all four time points. We could look deeper at the shared file to see whether those OTUs were
numerically rare or just had a low incidence.

{% unless include.short %}
Next, let's generate a dendrogram to describe the similarity of the samples to each other. We will generate a
dendrogram using the `jclass` and `thetayc` calculators within the **Tree.shared** tool:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Tree
>
> 1. **Tree.shared** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - *"Select input format"*: `Phylip Distance Matrix`
>   - {% icon param-collection %} *"phylip"*: the `distance files` output from **Dist.shared** {% icon tool%}
>
> 2. **Newick display** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>  - {% icon param-collection %} *"Newick file"*: output from **Tree.shared** {% icon tool %}
{: .hands_on}

{% endunless %}

Inspection of the the tree shows that the early and late communities cluster with themselves to the exclusion
of the others.


`thetayc.0.03.lt.ave`:

![Thetayc tree](../../images/tree.thetayc.png)

`jclass.0.03.lt.ave`:

# Visualisations

## Krona

A tool we can use to visualize the composition of our community, is [Krona](https://github.com/marbl/Krona/wiki)

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Krona
>
>  First we convert our mothur taxonomy file to a format compatible with Krona
>
> 1. **Taxonomy-to-Krona** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - {% icon param-collection %} *"Taxonomy file"*: the `taxonomy` output from **Classify.otu**
>
> 2. **Krona pie chart** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - *"Type of input"*: `Tabular`
>   - {% icon param-collection %} *"Input file"*: the `taxonomy` output from **Taxonomy-to-Krona** {% icon tool %}
{: .hands_on}

The resulting file is an HTML file containing an interactive visualization. For instance try double-clicking the
innermost ring labeled "Bacteroidetes" below:

### Exercise: generating per-sample Krona plots (Optional)

You may have noticed that this plot shows the results for all samples together. In many
cases however, you would like to be able to compare results for different samples.

In order to save computation time, mothur pools all reads into a single file, and uses
the `count table` file to keep track of which samples the reads came from. However, Krona
does not understand the mothur count table format, so we cannot use that to supply information
about the groups. But luckily we can get **Classify.otu** {% icon tool %} to output per-sample
taxonomy files. In the following exercise, we will create a Krona plot with per-sample subplots.

## Phinch

We may now wish to further visualize our results. We can convert our *shared* file to the more widely used `biom` format and
view it in a platform like [Phinch](http://www.phinch.org/).
