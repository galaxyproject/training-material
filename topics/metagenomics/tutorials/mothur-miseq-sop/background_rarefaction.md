> To estimate the fraction of species sequenced, rarefaction curves are typically used. A rarefaction curve
> plots the number of species as a function of the number of individuals sampled. The curve usually begins
> with a steep slope, which at some point begins to flatten as fewer species are being discovered per sample:
> the gentler the slope, the less contribution of the sampling to the total number of operational taxonomic
> units or OTUs.

> species rich habitat, only a small fraction has been sampled.
