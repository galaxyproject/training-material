# Overview
{:.no_toc}

In this tutorial we will perform the
[Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MiSeq data](https://www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP), developed by the
creators of the Mothur software package, the [Schloss lab](http://www.schlosslab.org/), within Galaxy.

# Obtaining and preparing data

In this tutorial we use 16S rRNA data, but similar pipelines can be used for WGS data.

> ### {% icon tip %} Background: The 16S ribosomal RNA gene

## Understanding our input data
In this tutorial we are interested in understanding the effect of normal variation in the gut microbiome on host health.
To that end, fresh feces from mice were collected on a daily basis for 365 days post weaning. During the first 150 days
post weaning (dpw), nothing was done to our mice except allow them to eat, get fat, and be merry. We were curious whether
the rapid change in weight observed during the first 10 dpw affected the stability microbiome compared to the microbiome
observed between days 140 and 150. We will address this question in this tutorial using a combination of OTU, phylotype,
and phylogenetic methods.

![Experiment setup](../../images/experiment_setup.png)

To make this tutorial easier to execute, we are providing only part of the data - you are given the flow files for one
animal at 10 time points (5 early and 5 late). In order to assess the error rate of our analysis pipeline and experimental
setup, we additionally resequenced a mock community composed of genomic DNA from 21 bacterial strains.

> ### {% icon comment %} Dataset details
> Because of the large size of the original dataset (3.9 GB) you are given 20 of the 362 pairs of fastq
> files. For example, you will see two files: `F3D0_S188_L001_R1_001.fastq`, and
> `F3D0_S188_L001_R2_001.fastq`
> <br><br>
> These two files correspond to Female 3 on Day 0 (F3D0) (i.e. the day of weaning). The first file
> (and all those with R1 in the name) correspond to the forward reads, while the second (and all
> those with R2 in the name) correspond to the reverse reads.
> <br><br>
> These sequences are 250 bp and overlap in the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene; this region is about
> 253 bp long. Looking at the datasets, you will see 22 fastq files, representing 10 time points from
> Female 3 and 1 mock community. You will also see `HMP_MOCK.v35.fasta` which contains the sequences used
> in the mock community that were sequenced in fasta format.

Now that's a lot of files to manage. Luckily Galaxy can make life a bit easier by allowing us to create
*dataset collections*. This enables us to easily run tools on multiple datasets at once. Let's
create a collection now:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Organizing our data into a collection
>

# Quality Control

## Reducing sequencing and PCR errors

The first thing we want to do is combine our forward and reverse reads for each sample. This is done
using the `make.contigs` command, which requires the paired collection as input. This command will extract
the sequence and quality score data from your fastq files, create the reverse complement of the reverse
read and then join the reads into contigs. Then we will combine all samples into a single fasta file,
remembering which reads came from which samples using a *group* file.

> ### {% icon comment %} Algorithm details
> We have a very simple algorithm to do this. First, we align the pairs of sequences. Next, we look

> base to an N.

### Merging our data

#### Make contigs from paired-end reads

In this experiment we used paired-end sequencing, this means sequencing was done from both ends of each
fragment, resulting in an overlap in the middle. We will now combine these pairs of reads into *contigs*.

![Merging into contigs](../../images/16S_merge_contigs.png)


> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Combine forward and reverse reads into contigs
>
> - **Make.contigs** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - "Way to provide files" to `Multiple pairs - Combo mode`
>   - "Fastq pairs" to the collection you just created
>   - Leave all other parameters to the default settings <br><br>
>
{: .hands_on}

This step merges the forward and reverse reads into contigs for each pair, and
then combines the results into a single fasta file. To retain information about
which reads originated from which samples, it also made a group file. View that
file now, it should look something like this:

```
M00967_43_000000000-A3JHG_1_1101_10011_3881     F3D0
M00967_43_000000000-A3JHG_1_1101_10050_15564    F3D0
M00967_43_000000000-A3JHG_1_1101_10051_26098    F3D0
```

Here the first column contains the read name, and the second column contains the sample name.


### Data Cleaning

For more information on the topic of quality control, please see our training materials
[here]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/sequence-analysis/)

Next we want to improve the quality of our data. But first, let's get a feel of our data

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Summarize data
>
> - **Summary.seqs** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - "fasta" parameter to the `trim.contigs.fasta` file created by the make.contigs tool
>   - "Output logfile?" to `yes`
>
{: .hands_on}

The `summary` output files give information per read. The `logfile` outputs also contain some summary
statistics:

```
             Start    End        NBases     Ambigs   Polymer  NumSeqs
Minimum:     1        248        248        0        3        1
2.5%-tile:   1        252        252        0        3        3810
25%-tile:    1        252        252        0        4        38091
Median:      1        252        252        0        4        76181
75%-tile:    1        253        253        0        5        114271
97.5%-tile:  1        253        253        6        6        148552
Maximum:     1        502        502        249      243      152360
Mean:        1        252.811    252.811    0.70063  4.44854
# of Seqs:   152360
```

This tells us that we have 152,360 sequences that for the most part vary between 248 and 253 bases.
Interestingly, the longest read in the dataset is 502 bp. Be suspicious of this. Recall that the reads
are supposed to be 251 bp each. This read clearly didn't assemble well (or at all). Also, note that at
least 2.5% of our sequences had some ambiguous base calls. We'll take care of these issues in the next
step when we run `screen.seqs`.

The following tool will remove any sequences with ambiguous bases (`maxambig` parameter) and anything longer than 275 bp (`maxlength` parameter).

## Processing improved sequences

### Optimize files for computation
Because we are sequencing many of the same organisms, we anticipate that many of our sequences are
duplicates of each other. Because it's computationally wasteful to align the same thing a bazillion
times, we'll unique our sequences using the `unique.seqs` command:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Remove duplicate sequences
>
> - **Unique.seqs** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - "fasta" to the `good.fasta` output from Screen.seqs
>   - "output format" to `Name File`
>
> > ### {% icon question %} Question
> >
> > How many sequences were unique? how many duplicates were removed?
> >

> >    >
> >    > This can be determined from the number of lines in the fasta (or names) output, compared to the
> >    > number of lines in the fasta file before this step.
> {: .question}
{: .hands_on}

This tool outputs two files, one is a fasta file containing only the unique sequences, and a *names files*.
The names file consists of two columns, the first contains the sequence names for each of the unique
sequences, and the second column contains all other sequence names that are identical to the representative
sequence in the first column.

```
name          representatives
read_name1    read_name2,read_name,read_name5,read_name11
read_name4    read_name6,read_name,read_name10
read_name7    read_name8
...
```

To reduce file sizes further and streamline analysis, we can now summarize the data in a *count table*.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Generate count table
>
> - **Count.seqs** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - "name" to the `names` output from Unique.seqs
>   - "Use a Group file" to `yes`
>   - "group" to the group file we created using the Screen.seqs tool
{: .hands_on}

The *count_table* output will look something like this:

```
Representative_Sequence                      total   F3D0   F3D1  F3D141  F3D142  ...
M00967_43_000000000-A3JHG_1_1101_14069_1827  4402    370    29    257     142
M00967_43_000000000-A3JHG_1_1101_18044_1900  28      1      0     1       0
M00967_43_000000000-A3JHG_1_1101_13234_1983  10522   425    281   340     205
...
```

The first column contains the read names of the representative sequence, and the subsequent columns contain
the number of duplicates of this sequence observed in each sample.

### Sequence Alignment

For more information on the topic of alignment, please see our training materials
[here]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/sequence-analysis/)

We are now ready to align our sequences to the reference. This step is an important
step to perform to improve the clustering of your OTUs [[Schloss 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2012.102)

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Align sequences
>
> 1. **Align.seqs** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - "fasta" to the fasta output from Unique.seqs
>   - "reference" to the `silva.v4.fasta` reference file
> <br><br>
> 2. **Summary.seqs** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - "fasta" parameter to the aligned output from previous step
>   - "count" parameter to `count_table` output from Count.seqs
>   - "Output logfile?" to `yes`
>
{: .hands_on}

Have a look at the summary output (log file):

```
            Start    End      NBases  Ambigs   Polymer  NumSeqs
Minimum:    1250     10693    250     0        3        1
2.5%-tile:  1968     11550    252     0        3        3222
25%-tile:   1968     11550    252     0        4        32219
Median:     1968     11550    252     0        4        64437
75%-tile:   1968     11550    253     0        5        96655
97.5%-tile: 1968     11550    253     0        6        125651
Maximum:    1982     13400    270     0        12       128872
Mean:       1967.99  11550    252.462 0        4.36693
# of unique seqs:   16426
total # of seqs:    128872
```

So what does this mean? You'll see that the bulk of the sequences start at position 1968 and end at position 11550.
Some sequences start at position 1250 or 1982 and end at 10693 or 13400. These deviants from the mode positions
are likely due to an insertion or deletion at the terminal ends of the alignments. Sometimes you'll see sequences
that start and end at the same position indicating a very poor alignment, which is generally due to non-specific
amplification.

### More Data Cleaning

To make sure that everything overlaps the same region we'll re-run screen.seqs to get sequences that
start at or before position 1968 and end at or after position 11550. We'll also set the maximum
homopolymer length to 8 (`maxhomop` parameter) since there's nothing in the database with a stretch of 9 or more of the same
base in a row (this also could have been done in the first execution of `screen.seqs` above).

Now we know our sequences overlap the same alignment coordinates, we want to make sure they *only* overlap
that region. So we'll filter the sequences to remove the overhangs at both ends. Since we've done
paired-end sequencing, this shouldn't be much of an issue. In addition, there are many
columns in the alignment that only contain gap characters (i.e. "."). These can be pulled out without
losing any information. We'll do all this with filter.seqs:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Filter sequences
>
> - **Filter.seqs** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - "fasta"" to good.fasta output from Sreen.seqs
>   - "Vertical" to `yes`
>   - "trump" to `.`
>   - "Output logfile" to `yes`
{: .hands_on}

In the log file we see the following information:

```
Length of filtered alignment: 376
Number of columns removed: 13049
Length of the original alignment: 13425
Number of sequences used to construct filter: 16298
```

This means that our initial alignment was 13425 columns wide and that we were able to remove 13049 terminal gap
characters using `trump=.` and vertical gap characters using `vertical=yes`. The final alignment length is 376
columns. Because we've perhaps created some redundancy across our sequences by trimming the ends, we can re-run
`unique.seqs`:

{: .hands_on}


### Pre-clustering
The next thing we want to do to further de-noise our sequences, is to pre-cluster the sequences using the
`pre.cluster` command, allowing for up to 2 differences between sequences. This command will split the
sequences by group and then sort them by abundance and go from most abundant to least and identify
sequences that differ no more than 2 nucleotides from on another. If this is the case, then they get
merged. We generally recommend allowing 1 difference for every 100 basepairs of sequence:

### Chimera Removal
At this point we have removed as much sequencing error as we can, and it is time to turn our attention to
removing sequencing artefacts known as chimeras.

> ### {% icon tip %} Background: Chimeras
> ![Chemirec sequence](../../images/chimeras.jpg)
> (slide credit: [http://slideplayer.com/slide/4559004/ ](http://slideplayer.com/slide/4559004/ ))
{: .tip}

We'll do this chimera removal using the `VSEARCH` algorithm that is called within Mothur, using the
`chimera.vsearch` command. This command will split the data by sample and check for chimeras.

Our preferred way of doing this is to use the abundant sequences as our reference. In addition, if a sequence
is flagged as chimeric in one sample, the default (`dereplicate=No`) is to remove it from all samples. Our
experience suggests that this is a bit aggressive since we've seen rare sequences get flagged as chimeric
when they're the most abundant sequence in another sample. This is how we do it:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Remove chimeric sequences

### Removal of non-bacterial sequences

As a final quality control step, we need to see if there are any "undesirables" in our dataset. Sometimes when
we pick a primer set they will amplify other stuff that survives to this point in the pipeline, such as
18S rRNA gene fragments or 16S rRNA from Archaea, chloroplasts, and mitochondria. There's also just the
random stuff that we want to get rid of.

Now you may say, "But wait I want that stuff". Fine. But, the primers we use, are only supposed to amplify
members of the Bacteria and if they're hitting Eukaryota or Archaea, then it is a mistake. Also, realize
that chloroplasts and mitochondria have no functional role in a microbial community.

Let's go ahead and classify those sequences using the Bayesian classifier with the `classify.seqs` command:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Remove undesired sequences
>
> - **Classify.seqs** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - "fasta" to the fasta output from Remove.seqs

Also of note is that *unknown* only pops up as a classification if the classifier cannot classify your
sequence to one of the domains.

At this point we have curated our data as far as possible and we're ready to see what our error rate is.


## Assessing error rates based on our mock community

Measuring the error rate of your sequences is something you can only do if you have co-sequenced a mock
community, that is, a sample of which you know the exact composition. This is something we include for
every 95 samples we sequence. You should too because it will help you gauge your error rates and allow
you to see how well your curation is going, and whether something is wrong with your sequencing setup.

> ### {% icon comment %} Definition
>
> **Mock community:** A defined mixture of microbial cells and/or viruses or nucleic acid molecules created

{: .comment}

Our mock community is composed of genomic DNA from 21 bacterial strains. So in a perfect world, this is
exactly what we would expect the analysis to produce as a result.

First, let's extract the sequences belonging to our mock samples from our data:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: extract mock sample from our dataset

>   - "groups" to `Mock`
>   - "fasta" to fasta output from Remove.lineage
>   - "output logfile?" to `yes`
>
{: .hands_on}

In the log file we see the following:

```
Selected 58 sequences from your fasta file.
Selected 4046 sequences from your count file
```

This tells us that we had 58 unique sequences and a total of 4,046 total sequences in our Mock sample. We
can now use the `seq.error` command to measure the error rates based on our mock reference. Here we align
the reads from our mock sample back to their known sequences, to see how many fail to match.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Assess error rates based on a mock community
> - **Seq.error** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters

>   - "count" to the count table from Get.groups
>   - "output log?" to `yes`
>
{: .hands_on}

 In the log file we see something like this:

```
Overall error rate:    6.5108e-05
Errors    Sequences
0    3998
1    3
2    0
3    2
4    1
[..]
```

That rocks, eh? Our error rate is 0.0065%!


### Cluster mock sequences into OTUs

We can now cluster the mock sequences into OTUs to see how many spurious OTUs we have:

> ### {% icon tip %} Background: Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)

Open the rarefaction output (dataset named `sobs` inside the `rarefaction curves` output collection).
You'll see that for 4060 sequences, we'd have 34 OTUs from the Mock community. This number of course
includes some stealthy chimeras that escaped our detection methods. If we used 3000 sequences, we would
have about 31 OTUs. In a perfect world with no chimeras and no sequencing errors, we'd have 20 OTUs.
This is not a perfect world. But this is pretty darn good!

{: .tip}

Now that we have assessed our error rates we are ready for some real analysis.

## Preparing for analysis

### Removing Mock sample
We're almost to the point where you can have some fun with your data (I'm already having fun, aren't you?).
Next, we would assign sequences to OTUs, but first, we should remove the Mock sample from our dataset, it has
served its purpose by allowing us to estimate our error rate, but in subsequent steps we only want to use
our real samples.

using
the `remove.groups` command:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Remove Mock community from our dataset
>
> - **Remove.groups** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - "Select input type" to `fasta , name, taxonomy, or list with a group file or count table`
>   - "count table", "fasta", and "taxonomy" to the respective outputs from Remove.lineage
>   - "groups" to `Mock`
{: .hands_on}


### Clustering sequences into OTUs

Now, we have a couple of options for clustering sequences into OTUs. For a small dataset like this, we could
do the traditional approach using `dist.seqs` and `cluster` as we did with the Mock sample.

The alternative is to use the `cluster.split` command. In this approach, we use the taxonomic information to
split the sequences into bins and then cluster within each bin. The Schloss lab have published results
showing that if you split at the level of Order or Family, and cluster to a 0.03 cutoff, you'll get just as
good of clustering as you would with the "traditional" approach.

The advantage of the `cluster.split` approach is that it should be faster, use less memory, and can be run on
multiple processors. In an ideal world we would prefer the traditional route because "Trad is rad", but we
also think that kind of humor is funny.... In this command we use `taxlevel=4`, which corresponds to the level
of *Order*. This is the approach that we  generally use in the Schloss lab.

>   - "list" to list output from Cluster.split

>
{: .hands_on}

Opening the taxonomy output for level 0.03 shows a file structured like the following:

```
OTU       Size    Taxonomy
..
Otu0008	5260	Bacteria(100);"Bacteroidetes"(100);"Bacteroidia"(100);"Bacteroidales"(100);"Rikenellaceae"(100);Alistipes(100);

..
```

This file tells you that Otu008 was observed 5260 times in your samples and that all of the
sequences (100%) were classified as being members of the Alistipes.

In this tutorial we will continue with this otu-based approach, for the phylotype and phylogenic
approaches, please refer to the [Mothur wiki page](https://www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP).

# OTU-based Analysis

Let's do something more interesting and actually analyze our data. We'll focus on the OTU-based dataset. The
phylotype-based analysis is essentially the same. Also, remember that our initial question had to do with the
stability and change in community structure in these samples when comparing early and late samples.

Keep in mind that the group names have either a F or M (sex of animal) followed by a number (number of
animal) followed by a D and a three digit number (number of days post weaning).

## Calculate Species Diversity

Diversity indices provide valuable mathematical tools to describe the ecological complexity of a single sample
(*alpha diversity*) or to detect species differences between samples (*beta diversity*). However, diversity
is not a determined physical quantity for which a consensus definition and unit of measure have been established,
and several diversity indices are currently available [Finotello et al. 2016].

### Alpha diversity

Let's start our analysis by analyzing the alpha diversity of the samples. First we will generate rarefaction
curves describing the number of OTUs observed as a function of sampling effort. We'll do this with the
`Rarefaction.single` command:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Calculate Rarefaction
> - **Rarefaction.single** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - "shared" to shared file from Make.shared
{: .hands_on}

Note that we used the default diversity measure here (*sobs*; observed species richness), but there are many
more options available under the *calc* parameter. The mothur wiki describes some of these calculators
[here](https://mothur.org/wiki/Calculators).

Examine the rarefaction curve output.

```
numsampled    0.03-F3D0    lci-F3D0    hci-F3D0    0.03-F3D1   ...
1              1.0000       1.0000      1.0000      1.0000
100           41.6560      35.0000     48.0000     45.0560
200           59.0330      51.0000     67.0000     61.5740
300           70.5640      62.0000     79.0000     71.4700
400           78.8320      71.0000     87.0000     78.4730
500           85.3650      77.0000     94.0000     83.9990
...
```

This file displays the number of OTUs identified per amount of sequences used (numsampled). What we would like
to see is the number of additional OTUs identified when adding more sequences reaching a plateau. Then we know
we have covered our full diversity. This information would be easier to interpret in the form of a graph.
Let's plot the rarefaction curve for a couple of our sequences:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Plot Rarefaction

>
{: .hands_on}

From the resulting image we can see that the rarefaction curves for all samples have started to level
off so we are confident we cover a large part of our sample diversity.

![Rarefaction curves](../../images/rarefaction_curves.png)

Alas, rarefaction is not a measure of richness, but a measure of diversity. If you consider two communities
with the same richness, but different evenness then after sampling a large number of individuals their
rarefaction curves will asymptote to the same value. Since they have different evennesses the shapes of
the curves will differ. Therefore, selecting a number of individuals to cutoff the rarefaction curve isn't
allowing a researcher to compare samples based on richness, but their diversity.

Finally, let's get a table containing the number of sequences, the sample coverage, the number of observed
OTUs, and the Inverse Simpson diversity estimate using the `Summary.single` command. To standardize everything,
let's randomly select 2440 sequences from each sample 1000 times and calculate the average:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Summary.single
>
> - **Summary.single** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - "share" to shared file from Make.shared
>   - "calc" to `nseqs,coverage,sobs,invsimpson`
>   - "size" to 2389
{: .hands_on}

The data will be outputted to a table called the *summary file*:

```

```

Interestingly, the sample coverages were all above 97%, indicating that we did a pretty good job of sampling
the communities. Plotting the richness or diversity of the samples would show that there was little difference
between the different animals or between the early and late time points. You could follow this up with a
repeated-measures ANOVA and find that there was no significant difference based on sex or early vs. late.

### Beta diversity

Beta diversity is a measure of the similarity of the membership and structure found between *different* samples.
The default calculator in the following section is *thetaYC*, which is the [Yue & Clayton theta similarity
coefficient](http://csyue.nccu.edu.tw/2005communicationindex.pdf)

{: .hands_on}

Look at some of the resulting heatmaps (you may have to download the SVG images first). In all of these
heatmaps the red colors indicate communities that are more similar than those with black colors.

For example this is the heatmap for the `thetayc` calculator (output `thetayc.0.03.lt.ave`):

![Heatmap for the thetayc calculator](../../images/heatmap.sim_thetayc.png)

and the jclass calulator (output `jclass.0.03.lt.ave`):

![Heatmap for the jclass calculator](../../images/heatmap.sim_jclass.png)

When generating Venn diagrams we are limited by the number of samples that we can analyze simultaneously.
Let's take a look at the Venn diagrams for the first 4 time points of female 3 using the `venn` command:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Venn diagram
>
> <!-- need to collapse collection again for group select to work -->

>   - Set `OTU Shared` to Subsample.shared file from previous step
>   - Set `groups` to `F3D0,F3D1,F3D2,F3D3`
{: .hands_on}

This generates a 4-way Venn diagram and a table listing the shared OTUs.

![Venn diagram and table with shared OTUs](../../images/venn.png)

This shows that there were a total of 180 OTUs observed between the 4 time points. Only 76 of those OTUs were
shared by all four time points. We could look deeper at the shared file to see whether those OTUs were
umerically rare or just had a low incidence.

Next, let's generate a dendrogram to describe the similarity of the samples to each other. We will generate a
dendrogram using the jclass and thetayc calculators within the `tree.shared` command:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Tree
>
> 1. **Tree.shared** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters

>
> 2. **Newick display** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>  - "Newick file" to output from Tree.shared (collection)
{: .hands_on}

Inspection of the the tree shows that the early and late communities cluster with themselves to the exclusion
of the others.

`thetayc.0.03.lt.ave`:

`jclass.0.03.lt.ave`:

# Visualisations

Mothur does not have a lot of visualization tools built in, but external tools may be used for this. For
instance we can convert our shared file to the more widely used `biom` format and view it in a platform like
[Phinch](http://www.phinch.org/).

## Phinch

Well done! you have completed the basics of the mothur SOP. Below are some more exercises for those who wish to
go into more details about statistical significance testing and population-level analysis.

## Determine statistical significance of clusterings

We can perform a test to determine whether the clustering within the tree is statistically significant or not
using by choosing from the `parsimony`, `unifrac.unweighted`, or `unifrac.weighted` commands. To run these we
will first need to create a design file that indicates which treatment each sample belongs to.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Obtain design file
>
> - Find the file `mouse.time.design` in your history (you imported this file at the start of this tutorial)
> - Make sure the datatype is set to `mothur.design`.
>
> > ### {% icon tip %} Changing datatype of a datasets

> >  - Click on the **Datatypes** tab
> >  - Select the new datatype from dropdown menu
> >  - Click **Save**
> {: .tip}
{: .hands_on}


The design file look something like this:

```
group    time
F3D0     Early
F3D1     Early
F3D141   Late
F3D142   Late
F3D143   Late
F3D144   Late
F3D145   Late
F3D146   Late
F3D147   Late
F3D148   Late
F3D149   Late
F3D150   Late
F3D2     Early
F3D3     Early
F3D5     Early
F3D6     Early
F3D7     Early
F3D8     Early
F3D9     Early
```

Using the `parsimony` command let's look at the pairwise comparisons. Specifically, let's focus on the
early vs. late comparisons for each mouse:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Compare Early-vs-Late
> - **Parsimony** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - "tree" to the `tre` output from Tree.Shared (collection)
>   - "group" to the design file described above
>   - "output logfile?" to `yes`
{: .hands_on}

In the logfile for `thetayc.0.03.lt.ave` we see

```
Tree#   Groups      ParsScore   ParsSig
1       Early-Late  1           <0.001
```

There was clearly a significant difference between the clustering of the early and late time points.
Recall that this method ignores the branch length.

The two distance matrices that we generated earlier (i.e. `jclass.0.03.lt.ave.dist` and
    `thetayc.0.03.lt.ave.dist`) can then be visualized using the pcoa or nmds plots.

Principal Coordinates (PCoA) uses an eigenvector-based approach to represent multidimensional
data in as few dimensions as possible. Our data is highly dimensional (~9 dimensions).

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: PCoA
>
> - **Pcoa** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - "phylip" to dist files from Dist.shared (collection)
{: .hands_on}

The loadings files will tell you what fraction of the total variance in the data are represented
by each of the axes. For instance the loading file for `thetayc.0.03.lt.ave` looks something like:

```
axis  loading
1     45.354207
2     13.526582
3     11.791424
4     4.493544
5     4.012474
...
```

In this case the first and second axis represent about 45 and 14% of the variation (59% of the total)
for the thetaYC distances. The output to the logfile:

```
Processing...
Rsq 1 axis: 0.736369
Rsq 2 axis: 0.882025
Rsq 3 axis: 0.978093
```

indicates that the R-squared between the original distance matrix and the distance between the points in 2D
PCoA space was 0.88, but that if you add a third dimension the R-squared value increases to 0.98. All in all,
not bad.

Alternatively, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) tries to preserve the distance between samples using
a user defined number of dimensions. We can run our data through NMDS with 2 dimensions with the following
tool:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Nmds
>
> - **Nmds** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - "phylip" to dist files from Dist.shared (collection)
>   - "output logfile?" to `yes`

> Number of dimensions:           2
> Lowest stress :                 0.113657
> R-squared for configuration:    0.947622
> ```
>
> We find that the lowest stress value was 0.11 with an R-squared value of 0.95; that stress level is

{: .hands_on}



In general, we would like a stress value below 0.20 and a value below 0.10 is even better. Thus, we can conclude that,
NMDS is better than PCoA. We can plot the three dimensions of the NMDS data by plotting the contents of the `axes`
file. <!-- TODO: tool for 3D plots in Galaxy? -->

Again, it is clear that the early and late samples cluster separately from each other. Ultimately, ordination
is a data visualization tool. We might ask if the spatial separation that we see between the early and late
plots in the NMDS plot is statistically significant. To do this we have two statistical tools at our disposal.
The first analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), tests whether the centers of the clouds representing a group
are more separated than the variation among samples of the same treatment. This is done using the distance
matrices we created earlier and does not actually use ordination.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Amova
>
> - **Amova** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - "phylip" to dist files from Dist.shared (collection)
>   - "design" to mouse.time.design file from your history
>   - "output logfile?" to `yes`
{: .hands_on}

in logfile for thetaYC we find:

```
Early-Late    Among       Within     Total
SS            0.628379    0.552221   1.1806
df            1           17         18
MS    0.628379    0.0324836

Fs:    19.3445
p-value: <0.001*
```

Here we see from the AMOVA that the "cloud" early and late time points has a significantly different centroid
for this mouse. Thus, the observed separation in early and late samples is statistically significant. We can
also see whether the variation in the early samples is significantly different from the variation in the late
samples using the `Homova` command:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Homova
>
> - **Homova** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - "phylip" to dist files from Dist.shared (collection)
>   - "design" to mouse.time.design file from your history
>   - "output logfile?" to `yes`
{: .hands_on}

```
HOMOVA        BValue     P-value    SSwithin/(Ni-1)_values
Early-Late    7.51408    <0.001*    0.0603208    0.00773943
```

We see that there is a significant difference in the variation with the early samples having a larger amount
of variation (0.061) than the late samples (0.008). This was what we found in the original study - the early
samples were less stable than the late samples.

Next, we might ask which OTUs are responsible for shifting the samples along the two axes. We can determine
this by measuring the correlation of the relative abundance of each OTU with the two axes in the NMDS dataset.
We do this with the `corr.axes` tool:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Correlation
>
> - **Corr.axes** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - "axes" to axes output from Nmds in 3 dimension (collection)
>   - "shared" to shared output from collapse collection on Sub.sample
>   - "method" to `Spearman`
>   - "numaxes" to `3`
{: .hands_on}

Examining the axes output, we see the data for the first five OTUs look something like this..

```
OTU         axis1       p-value      axis2       p-value     axis3       p-value     length
Otu0001     0.285213    0.226258    -0.742431    0.000272    0.676613    0.001466    1.044201
Otu0002     0.283582    0.228923    -0.636524    0.003387    0.873574    0.000001    1.117458
Otu0003     0.461270    0.046828    -0.586271    0.008337    0.767610    0.000125    1.070378
Otu0004    -0.131579    0.576679    -0.240351    0.307860    0.408772    0.082266    0.492114
Otu0005    -0.315327    0.180955     0.046553    0.843432    0.097497    0.679135    0.333323
...
```

What these results show is that OTUs 1 and 2 are responsible for moving points in a negative direction along
axis 2. Recalling that we classified each OTU earlier (see taxonomy output from `Classify.otu`), we can see
that these first five OTUs are mainly members of the Porphyromonadaceae:

```
OTU        Size   Taxonomy
Otu0001    12329   Bacteria(100);"Bacteroidetes"(100);"Bacteroidia"(100);"Bacteroidales"(100);"Porphyromonadaceae"(100);unclassified(100);
Otu0002    8912    Bacteria(100);"Bacteroidetes"(100);"Bacteroidia"(100);"Bacteroidales"(100);"Porphyromonadaceae"(100);unclassified(100);
Otu0003    7857    Bacteria(100);"Bacteroidetes"(100);"Bacteroidia"(100);"Bacteroidales"(100);"Porphyromonadaceae"(100);unclassified(100);
Otu0004    7483    Bacteria(100);"Bacteroidetes"(100);"Bacteroidia"(100);"Bacteroidales"(100);"Porphyromonadaceae"(100);Barnesiella(100);
Otu0005    7479    Bacteria(100);"Bacteroidetes"(100);"Bacteroidia"(100);"Bacteroidales"(100);"Porphyromonadaceae"(100);unclassified(100);
...
```

This helps to illustrate the power of OTUs over phylotypes since each of these OTUs is behaving differently.
These data can be plotted in what's known as a biplot where lines radiating from the origin (axis1=0, axis2=0,
axis3=0) to the correlation values with each axis are mapped on top of the PCoA or NMDS plots.
<!-- TODO: make this plot? -->

Later, using the metastats command, we will see another method for describing which populations are
responsible for differences seen between specific treatments.

An alternative approach to building a biplot would be to provide data indicating metadata about each sample.
For example, we may know the weight, height, blood pressure, etc. of the subjects in these samples. For
discussion purposes the file `mouse.dpw.metadata` is provided and looks something like this:

```
group    dpw
F3D0     0
F3D1     1
F3D141   141

In logfile we find the following output:

```
K    NLE        logDet    BIC         AIC         Laplace
1    9612.15    522.97    10070.01    9923.15     9587.84
2    9688.76    464.05    10605.95    10311.76    9348.28
3    10329.39   329.18    11705.91    11264.39    9634.77
4    11026.12   97.78     12861.98    12273.12    9929.10
5    11662.52  -250.61    13957.71    13221.52    10104.59
```

We see that the minimum Laplace value is for a K value of 2 (9348.28). This indicates that our samples
belonged to two community types. Opening the `design` output we see that all of the late samples and the Day 0
sample belonged to Partition_1 and the other early samples belonged to Partition_2. We can look at the
`summary` output to see which OTUs were most responsible for separating the communities:

```
OTU        P0.mean  P1.mean  P1.lci  P1.uci  P2.mean  P2.lci  P2.uci  Difference   CumFraction
Otu0006    3.36     10.48    9.17    11.97   0.46     0.28    0.78    10.01        0.15
Otu0014    6.17     8.45     7.35    9.72    3.76     2.98    4.73    4.70         0.22
Otu0002    5.63     7.14     6.17    8.25    3.83     3.05    4.81    3.31         0.27
Otu0008    4.01     2.92     2.41    3.54    5.85     4.80    7.12    2.92         0.31
Otu0019    2.07     3.48     2.90    4.18    0.94     0.63    1.40    2.54         0.35
...
```

Again we can cross reference these OTU labels with the consensus classifications in the taxonomy file to get
the names of these organisms.

## Population-level Analysis

In addition to the use of `corr.axes` and `get.communitytype` we have several tools to differentiate between
different groupings of samples. The first we'll demonstrate is `metastats`, which is a non-parametric T-test
that determines whether there are any OTUs that are differentially represented between the samples from early and late in this study.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: T-test
>
> - **Metastats** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - "shared" to Subsample.shared
>   - "design" to `mouse.time.design`
{: .hands_on}

Looking at the first 5 OTUs from `Late-Early` output file we see the following:

```
OTU        mean(group1)  variance(group1)  stderr(group1)  mean(group2)  variance(group2)  stderr(group2)  p-value
Otu0001    0.026104      0.000079          0.002807        0.011304      0.000031          0.001856        0.000999
Otu0002    0.072869      0.000101          0.003176        0.041946      0.000208          0.004805        0.000999
Otu0003    0.015261      0.000023          0.001531        0.002182      0.000003          0.000539        0.000999
Otu0004    0.029451      0.000064          0.002536        0.020427      0.000140          0.003947        0.074925
Otu0005    0.068139      0.000087          0.002957        0.070058      0.000163          0.004254        0.729271
```

These data tell us that OTUs 1, 2, and 3 was significantly different between the early and late samples.

Another non-parametric tool we can use as an alternative to metastats is lefse:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Lefse
>
> - **Lefse** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - "shared" to Subsample.shared
>   - "design" to `mouse.time.design`
{: .hands_on}

Looking at the top of the lefse summary file we see:

```
OTU        LogMaxMean  Class   LDA         pValue
Otu0001    4.41671     Late    3.91585    0.000601825
Otu0002    4.86254     Late    4.20329    0.000695271
Otu0003    4.18358     Late    3.82749    0.00022674
Otu0004    4.4691      -
Otu0005    4.84546     -
```

Again, OTUs 1, 2, and 3 are significantly different between the two groups and are significantly elevated in the
late samples

Finally, Mothur has an implementation of the random forest algorithm build into her as classify.rf. This will tell
us which features (i.e. OTUs) are useful in discriminating between the two groups of samples:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Classify.rf
>
> - **Classify.rf** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters
>   - "shared" to Subsample.shared
>   - "design" to `mouse.time.design`
{: .hands_on}

in the logfile we see:

```
Creating 100 (th) Decision tree
numCorrect = 19
forrestErrorRate = 0
confusion matrix:
        Early    Late    time
Early   9        0       0
Late    0        10      0
time    0        0       0
```

We can ignore the time row and column and see that our samples were all correctly assigned to the proper groups.
Looking at `summary` output, we see the top 10 OTUs that resulted in the greatest mean decrease in activity were:

```
OTU        Mean decrease accuracy
Otu0038    0.21
Otu0003    0.15
Otu0091    0.14
Otu0096    0.13
Otu0024    0.12
Otu0006    0.1
Otu0011    0.1
Otu0015    0.09
Otu0082    0.08
Otu0042    0.07
```
