This tutorial was adapted from the [mothur MiSeq SOP](https://mothur.org/wiki/miseq_sop/) created by the Schloss lab. Here you can find more information about the mothur tools and file formats. Their [FAQ page](https://mothur.org/wiki/frequently_asked_questions/) and [Help Forum](https://forum.mothur.org/) are also quite useful!
