For this short tutorial, while the workflow is running, these slides can be useful
to explain the tools that are being run in that section. After explaining the tools,
the workflows should be far enough along to start showing the results

## Input: Cellulose Degradation in a Biogas Reactor

![Workflow graph showing biogas reactor extract being transferred to cellulose and incubated. Time series samples are taken and run through a mass spectrometer and genomic sequencer.](../../images/metatranscriptomics/experimental_setup.png)



???

A 100 µl aliquot of an enriched community from a biogas reactor was transferred to 27 anaerobic bottles containing a rich medium and 10g/L of cellulose as sole carbon source and incubated at 65 °C.

Three bottles were collected at 9 different time points (0, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33, 38 and 43 h) and processed in triplicates. Metatranscriptomic analysis was performed on all time points. Metaproteomics analysis on 4 data points.

## Input Format: FastQ Files


- Four lines per read

![Image of a fastq file with label on the first line, sequence on the second, + on the third, and quality scores on the fourth as ascii chars. A callout shows that Base=T, quality=colon, and that means a score of 25.](../../../sequence-analysis/images/quality-control/fastq_fig.jpg)

???

- Four lines per read
  - `@` + identifier on first line, just like fasta
  - sequence
  - `+`
  - quality score characters

Segue: so what do the quality chars mean?

---

## FastQ: Quality score

- Each character denotes a different Phred score

  ![Encoding of the quality score with ASCII characters for different Phred encoding. The ascii code sequence is shown at the top with symbols for 33 to 64, upper case letters, more symbols, and then lowercase letters. Sanger maps from 33 to 73 while solexa is shifted, starting at 59 and going to 104. Illumina 1.3 starts at 54 and goes to 104, Illumina 1.5 is shifted three scores to the right but still ends at 104. Illumina 1.8+ goes back to the Sanger except one single score wider. Illumina](../../../sequence-analysis/images/quality_score_encoding.png)

- Phred scores are logarithmic

.small[
Phred Quality Score | Probability of incorrect base call | Base call accuracy
--- | --- | ---
10 | 1 in 10 | 90%
20 | 1 in 100 | 99%
30 | 1 in 1000 | 99.9%
40 | 1 in 10,000 | 99.99%
...
]

???

- Logarithmic scale
- Different flavours of encoding exist

## Quality Reports: FastQC

- Generate a web report with quality metrics of your FastQ file

![Screenshot of FastQC report, showing the table of contents with green checks on nearly every result, and the base statistics and per-base sequence quality graphs shown.](../../../sequence-analysis/images/fastqc-report.png)

.footnote[see also our [dedicated QC tutorial]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.md %})  ]

---

## Quality Reports: FastQC

- Many different QC plots
- Example: Per-base sequence Quality plot

![Fastqc quality score plot, most results are in the green region but the box portion of the box and whisker plot start to dip into the yellow, medium quality (less than 30) region near 34+ base position in read. The whiskers begin extending to the red region (less than 20) by base 31 and get progressively worse.](../../../sequence-analysis/images/per_base_sequence_quality_good.png)


.footnote[explanation of different plots: [dedicated QC tutorial]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.md %})  ]

???
- in the per-base sequence quality plot, a boxplot of the base quality (y-axis) per position in the read (x-axis) is drawn
- often you might observe a drop in quality towards the end of the reads, and may consider trimming ends
- this example is very good

---

## Quality Reports: FastQC

- Many more plots
- See [QC tutorial]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.md %}) for more information

![Montage of several different fastq reports showing sequence quality graphs, and a numb er of other line graphs.](../../../sequence-analysis/images/quality-control/all_plots.png)


---

## Quality Reports: MultiQC

.pull-left[
- Combine multiple FastQC reports into one report

- Also for outputs of other tools

- Great when sequencing large numbers of samples
]

.pull-right[
![Multiqc's report showing an aggregation of multiple samples. An overview at the top provides context for the 4 samples, and a sequence quality histogram shows 4 samples with similarly behaving quality scores](../../images/metatranscriptomics/multiqc.png)
]

---

## Read Trimming and Filtering: Cutadapt

- Trim low-quality bases from reads
- Filter reads based on length, mean quality score, ..
- Remove adapters/primers

  .image-75[![adapter trimming](../../../sequence-analysis/images/quality-control/trimming.png)]

- Many tools: CutAdapt {% icon tool %}, TrimGalore {% icon tool %}, Trimmomatic {% icon tool%} ..

???
These are some examples of ways to trim and filter data, but many more are possible and depend on your experiment what is necessary

---

## SortMeRNA

.pull-left[

- Most RNA sequences will be ribosomal RNA (rRNA)

- Great for taxonomical assignment (who is there?)

- Not informative for functional analysis (What are they doing?)

- Filter out rRNA before doing functional analysis
]

.pull-right[
.image-90[![SortMeRNA](../../images/metatranscriptomics/sortmerna.png)]
]

---

## FastQ interlacer

- Paired-end data often comes in two separate FastQ files
- One file with *forward* reads, one with *reverse* reads

<br>

![paired end deinterlaced file](../../../sequence-analysis/images/mapping/pairedend_fastq.png)

---

## FastQ interlacer

- Some tools require a single **interlaced** FastQ file
- Galaxy has tools for **interlacing** and **deinterlacing** FastQ files

<br>

![paired end interlaced file](../../../sequence-analysis/images/mapping/pairedend_interlaced.png)


???
forward and reverse files are 'zipped' together into a single file

---

## Community Profile

- We want to identify which organisms are present in our sample, and their relative abundances

![Cartoon of several differently coloured and shaped microbes in a circle.](../../images/microbial-community.png)

- **MetaPhlan2** {% icon tool %} for identification
- **Krona** {% icon tool %} and **Graphlan** {% icon tool %} for visualisation

---

## MetaPhlan2 {% icon tool %}

- Estimates the presence and relative abundance of microbial cells
- Maps reads against a set of marker sequences
- Caveat: this tool is designed for DNA-seq
  - Be careful interpreting abundances when using this tool with transcriptomics data

.footnote[Nat Methods. 2012 Jun 10;9(8):811-4. doi: 10.1038/nmeth.2066.]

???

About the caveat: The theoretical problem is that we quantify species abundance by averaging the coverage of marker genes. Marker genes are supposed to be at the same coverage as they are single copy genes from the same genome, but this is not true for their transcripts. So MetaPhlAn2 on metatranscriptomics gives an idea about the average transcriptional rate of a given species. So it _can_ be used with caution...


---

## Krona {% icon tool %}

- Visualization of community composition, interactive plot

]

???
Takes non rRNA reads + MetaPhlAn2 gives list of abundant organism, then it does Nucleotide level pangenome mapping with Bowtie and uses CHocophlAN db
giving unmapped and organims specific gene hits, the unmapped reads are further searched against accelerated translated protein database
the protein hits are tehn combined with gene hits and metacyc to give the output.

---


**Result:** Gene family and pathway abundances

.image-40[![A table with two columns, Feature on left and RPK on right. GeneX has an RPK of 8. GeneX|Species1 has an RPK of 2, species2 and unclassified are listed with an RPK of 3.](../../images/metatranscriptomics/humann2_tiered5.png)]

---

## Gene Families Abundances

![Screenshot of a table in Galaxy with Gene Family on left and humann2 abundance RPKs on right.](../../images/metatranscriptomics/gene_family_abundance.png)

RPK (reads per kilobase) = sum of alignment scores

???
Gene families: groups of evolutionary related protein that perform similar function
Pathway: sum over genes catalyzing the reaction
Pathway coverage: presence/absence
RPK relative gene copy number : is computed as the sum of all alignments scores over a particular gene family
UNMAPPED: total number of reads that remained unmapped even after both alignment steps
UNINTEGRATED: no pathway detected.

---

## Gene Families to Functional Annotation

![Humann2 regroup table is the left node in a flow chart with UniRef50. Multiple lines are drawn to an unlabelled right node that lists metacyc, kegg, pfam, EC, GO, informative GO, slim GO.](../../images/metatranscriptomics/results_functional_annotation.png)

???
Gene familes are too large depending on the complexity thus to simplify users can regroup gene families using grouping tool, can download mapping files.
HUMAnN2 regroups Uniref 50/90 values to Go terms to get a broad overview.

---

## Group Abundances

![humann2 regroup table, lines from uniref50 to GO. group humann2 to GO slim terms shows a similar graphic, lines from uniref50 to slim GO.](../../images/metatranscriptomics/results_group_abundances.png)


???
Group abundances converts GO terms to Go slim (subset of GO terms) into Mol function, biological process and cellular components.
