# Overview
{:.no_toc}

Pervasive use (and misuse) of antibiotics for human disease treatment, as well as for various agricultural purposes, has resulted in the evolution of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogenic bacteria. The [Center for Disease Control estimates](https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/) that in the U.S. alone, every year at least 2 million people get an antibiotic-resistant infection, and at least 23,000 people die. Antibiotic resistance poses a major public health challenge, and its causes and mitigations are widely studied.

Plasmids are small DNA molecules within a cell which are physically separated from chromosomal DNA and can replicate independently. They are most commonly found as small circular, double-stranded DNA molecules in bacteria.

![Depiction of plasmids](../../images/plasmid-metagenomics-nanopore/plasmids.png)

Plasmids are considered a major vector facilitating the transmission of drug resistant genes among bacteria via [horizontal transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer) ({% cite Beatson2014 %}, {% cite Smillie2010 %}). Careful characterization of plasmids and other MDR mobile genetic elements is vital for understanding their evolution and transmission and adaptation to new hosts.

![Illustration of transformation of a bacteria to drug resistance](../../images/plasmid-metagenomics-nanopore/bacterial_transformation.png)

Due to the high prevalence of repeat sequences and inserts in plasmids, using traditional NGS short-read sequencing to assemble plasmid sequences is difficult and time-consuming. With the advent of third-generation single-molecule long-read sequencing technologies, full assembly of plasmid sequences is now possible.

In this tutorial we will recreate the analysis described in the paper by {% cite LiXie2018 %} entitled *Efficient generation of complete sequences of MDR-encoding plasmids by rapid assembly of MinION barcoding sequencing data*. We will use data sequenced by the [Nanopore](https://nanoporetech.com/) MinION sequencer.

The assembly will be performed with **Minimap2** {% icon tool %} ({% cite Li2018 %}),
**Miniasm** {% icon tool %} ({% cite Li2016 %}), **Racon** {% icon tool %} ({% cite Vaser2017 %}) and **Unicycler** {% icon tool %} ({% cite Wick2017 %}).
The downstream analysis will use **Nanoplot** {% icon tool %} ({% cite DeCoster2018 %}),
**Bandage** {% icon tool %} ({% cite Wick2015 %}), **PlasFlow** {% icon tool %} ({% cite Krawczyk2018 %}) and **starmr** {% icon tool %} ([GitHub](https://github.com/phac-nml/staramr)).

A schematic view of the workflow we will perform in this tutorial is given below:

In this tutorial we use metagenomic Nanopore data, but similar pipelines can be used for other types of datasets or other long-read sequencing platforms.


# Obtaining and preparing data

We are interested in the reconstruction of full plasmid sequences and determining the presence of any antimicrobial resistance genes.
We will use the plasmid dataset created by {% cite LiXie2018 %} for their evaluation of the efficiency of MDR plasmid sequencing by MinION platform. In the experiment, 12 MDR plasmid-bearing bacterial strains were selected for plasmid extraction, including *E. coli*, *S. typhimurium*, *V. parahaemolyticus*, and *K. pneumoniae*.

# Quality Control

## NanoPlot to explore data


The first thing we want to do is to get a feeling for our input data and its quality. This is done
using the NanoPlot tool. This will create several plots, a statisical report and an HTML
report page.

![NanoPlot example](../../images/plasmid-metagenomics-nanopore/NanoPlot.png)

The `HTML report` gives an overview of various QC metrics for each sample. For example, it will
plot the read length distribution of each sample:

# De-novo Assembly

## Pairwise alignment using Minimap2

In this experiment we used Nanopore sequencing; this means sequencing results with long reads, and significant overlaps between those reads.
To find this overlap, Minimap2 is used. Minimap2 is a sequence alignment program that can be used for different
purposes, but in this case we'll use it to find overlaps between long reads with an error rate up to ~15%.
Typical other use cases for Minimap2 include:

1. mapping PacBio or Oxford Nanopore genomic reads to the human genome
2. splice-aware alignment of PacBio Iso-Seq or Nanopore cDNA or Direct RNA reads against a reference genome
3. aligning Illumina single- or paired-end reads
4. assembly-to-assembly alignment
5. full-genome alignment between two closely related species with divergence below ~15%.

Minimap2 is faster and more accurate than mainstream long-read mappers such as BLASR, BWA-MEM, NGMLR and GMAP and
therefore widely used for Nanopore alignment. Detailed evaluations of Minimap2 are available in
the Minimap2 publication ({% cite Li2018 %}).

![Pairwise alignment](../../images/plasmid-metagenomics-nanopore/Minimap2.png)

This step maps the Nanopore sequence reads against itself to find overlaps. The result is a PAF file.
PAF is a text format describing the approximate mapping positions between two
set of sequences. PAF is TAB-delimited with each line consisting of the
following predefined fields:

|Col|Type  |Description                               |
|--:|:----:|:-----------------------------------------|
|1  |string|Query sequence name                       |
|2  |int   |Query sequence length                     |
|3  |int   |Query start (0-based)                     |
|4  |int   |Query end (0-based)                       |
|5  |char  |Relative strand: "+" or "-"               |
|6  |string|Target sequence name                      |
|7  |int   |Target sequence length                    |
|8  |int   |Target start on original strand (0-based) |
|9  |int   |Target end on original strand (0-based)   |
|10 |int   |Number of residue matches                 |
|11 |int   |Alignment block length                    |
|12 |int   |Mapping quality (0-255; 255 for missing)  |

View the output of **Minimap2** {% icon tool %} of the collection against RB12, it should look something like this:
```

```

## Ultrafast de novo assembly using Miniasm

The mapped reads are ready to be assembled with **Miniasm** {% icon tool%} ({% cite Li2016 %}). Miniasm is a very fast Overlap Layout Consensus based de-novo assembler for noisy long reads.
It takes all-vs-all read self-mappings (typically by **Minimap2** {% icon tool%}) as input and outputs an assembly graph in the GFA format.

Different from mainstream assemblers, miniasm does not have a consensus step.
It simply concatenates pieces of read sequences to generate the final sequences.
The optimal case would be to recreate a complete chromosome or plasmid.
Thus the per-base error rate is similar to the raw input reads.

![Pairwise alignment](../../images/plasmid-metagenomics-nanopore/Miniasm.png "Sequencing and Assembly Schematic. A longer sequence is constructed from many smaller, overlapping fragments. These are aligned and reconstructed during assembly to produce the best guess assembly.")

{: .hands_on}

The `Assembly Graph` output file gives information about the steps taken in the assembly.

The output should look like:

```
S	utg000001l	GAAATCATCAGGCGTTTTTCACGATATGGACGGGAAGATGCGGAAATAGGCAGGAGGACATAGAA [..]

```

## Remapping using Minimap2

Remapping is done with the original reads, using the Miniasm assembly as a reference, in order to improve the consensus base call per position. This is used by **Racon** {% icon tool %} for consensus construction. This is done as some reads which might not have mapped well during the consensus calling, will now map to your scaffold.

The Assembly graph created can be used for mapping again with Minimap2, but first the graph should be transformed to FASTA format.

## Ultrafast consensus module using Racon

The mapped reads can be improved even more using **Racon** {% icon tool%} ({% cite Vaser2017 %}) to find a consensus sequence.
Racon is a standalone consensus module to correct raw contigs generated by rapid assembly methods which do not include a consensus step.
It supports data produced by both Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies.

![Consensus Module](../../images/plasmid-metagenomics-nanopore/Racon.png)


> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Consensus module

>   - {% icon param-collection %} *"Target sequences"*: the `FASTA file` collection created by **GFA to Fasta** {% icon tool %}
>
{: .hands_on}

The **Racon** {% icon tool %} output file gives the final contigs.

The output of RB04 should look something like:

```

AATGCAGCTATGGCGCGTGCGGTGCCAAGAAAGCCCGCAGATATTCCGCTTCCTCGCTCATT [..]
```

## Visualize assemblies using Bandage

To get a sense of how well our data was assembled, and to determine whether the contigs are chomosomal or plasmid DNA (the former being linear sequences while plasmids are circular molecules), **Bandage** {% icon tool %} can give a clear view of the assembly.

**Bandage** {% icon tool%} ({% cite Wick2015 %}) (a **B**ioinformatics **A**pplication for **N**avigating **D**e novo **A**ssembly **G**raphs **E**asily), is a program that creates visualisations of assembly graphs.
Sequence assembler programs (such as **Miniasm** {% icon tool %} ({% cite Li2016 %}), **Velvet** {% icon tool %} ({% cite Zerbino2008 %}), **SPAdes** {% icon tool %} ({% cite Bankevich2012 %}), **Trinity** {% icon tool %} ({% cite Grabherr2011 %}) and **MEGAHIT** {% icon tool %} {% cite Li2015 %}) carry out assembly by building a graph, from which contigs are generated.

By visualizing these assembly graphs, Bandage allows users to better understand, troubleshoot, and improve the assemblies.

For example, the assembly for sample RB01 looks something like this (your assembly will look a bit different due to randomness in several of the tools):


![Bandage output for sample RB01](../../images/plasmid-metagenomics-nanopore/bandage_pre_unicycler.png "Bandage output for sample RB01. Large fragments were assembled, but not the full circular plasmid molecules.")


As you can see from these Bandage outputs, we were able to assemble our data into fairly large fragments, but were not quite successful in assembling the full (circular) plasmid sequences.

However, all the tools we used to do the assembly have many different parameters that we did not explore, and multiple rounds of mapping and cleaning could improve our data as well. Choosing these parameters carefully could potentially improve our assembly, but this is also a lot of work and not an easy task. This is where **Unicycler** {% icon tool %} ({% cite Wick2017 %}) can help us out.


## Optimizing assemblies using Unicycler

The assembly tools we used in this tutorial are all implemented in **Unicycler** {% icon tool %}, which will repeatedly run these tools on your data using different parameter settings, in order to find the optimal assembly.

**Unicycler** {% icon tool %} has a couple of advantages over running the tools separately:

1. The first modification is to **help circular replicons assemble** into circular string graphs.
2. **Racon** {% icon tool %} polishing is carried out in **multiple rounds to improve the sequence accuracy**. It will polish until the assembly stops improving, as measured by the agreement between the reads and the assembly.
3. Circular replicons are 'rotated' (have their starting position shifted) between rounds of polishing to ensure that **no part of the sequence is left unpolished**.


Let's try it on our data!

The Assembly graph image of the RB01 assembly with **miniasm** {% icon tool %} shows one unclear hypothetical plasmid, where the output of **Unicycler** {% icon tool %} shows two clear plasmids, as also shown by {% cite LiXie2018 %}.

# Species and plasmids

## Prediction of plasmid sequences and classes using PlasFlow

To automatically determine whether the contigs represent chromosomal or plasmid DNA, **PlasFlow** {% icon tool %} ({% cite Krawczyk2018 %}) can be used, also in the case where a full circular plasmid sequence was not assembled. Furthermore, it assigns the contigs to a bacterial class.

**PlasFlow** {% icon tool %} is a set of scripts used for prediction of plasmid sequences in metagenomic contigs.
It relies on the neural network models trained on full genome and plasmid sequences and is able to differentiate between plasmids and chromosomes with accuracy reaching 96%.

The most important output of **PlasFlow** {% icon tool %} is a tabular file containing all predictions, consisting of several columns including:

```
contig_id 	contig_name 	contig_length 	id 	label 	...
```

where:

- `contig_id`is an internal id of sequence used for the classification
- `contig_name` is a name of contig used in the classification
- `contig_length` shows the length of a classified sequence
- `id` is an internal id of a produced label (classification)
- `label` is the actual classification
- `...` represents additional columns showing probabilities of assignment to each possible class

Additionally, PlasFlow produces FASTA files containing input sequences binned to plasmids, chromosomes and unclassified.

# Antibiotic Resistance

## Scan genome contigs for antimicrobial resistance genes

To determine whether the contigs contain antimircobial resistance genes (AMR) [staramr](https://github.com/phac-nml/staramr) can be used.
**Staramr** {% icon tool %} scans bacterial genome contigs against both the **ResFinder** ({% cite Zankari2012 %}), **PointFinder** ({% cite Zankari2017 %}), and **PlasmidFinder** ({% cite Carattoli2014 %}) databases (used by the ResFinder webservice)
and compiles a summary report of detected antimicrobial resistance genes.

There are 5 different output files produced by **staramr** {% icon tool %}:

1. `summary.tsv`:  A summary of all detected AMR genes/mutations in each genome, one genome per line.
2. `resfinder.tsv`: A tabular file of each AMR gene and additional BLAST information from the **ResFinder** database, one gene per line.
3. `pointfinder.tsv`: A tabular file of each AMR point mutation and additional BLAST information from the **PointFinder** database, one gene per line.
4. `settings.txt`: The command-line, database versions, and other settings used to run `staramr`.
5. `results.xlsx`: An Excel spreadsheet containing the previous 4 files as separate worksheets.

The summary file is most important and provides all the resistance genes found.

## CARD database
To get more information about these antibiotic resistant genes, you can check the [CARD database](https://card.mcmaster.ca) (**C**omprehensive **A**ntibiotic **R**esistance **D**atabase) ({% cite Jia2016 %})

# Conclusion
You have now seen how to perform an assembly on Nanopore sequencing data, and classify the type and species of the sequences, as well as determined the presence of potential antibiotic resistance genes.

As for any analysis, there are many different tools that can do the job, and the tools presented here are just
one possible pipeline. Which tools are best for your specific data and research question depends on a number of
factors. For more information and comparisons between various tools, review papers such as {% cite DeMaio2019 %} and {% cite Jayakumar2017 %}
may provide further insight.

You have worked your way through the following pipeline:
