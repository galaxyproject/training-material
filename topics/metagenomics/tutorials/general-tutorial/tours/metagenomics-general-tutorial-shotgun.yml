      In shotgun data, full genomes of the micro-organisms in the environment
      are sequenced (not only the 16S or 18S). We can then have access to the
      rRNA (only a small part of the genomes), but also to the genes of the
      micro-organisms. Using this information, we can try to answer to questions
      "What are the micro-organisms doing?" in addition to the question "What
      micro-organisms are present?".<br><br> In this second part, we will use a
      metagenomic sample of the Pampas Soil (<a

    content: >-
      As for amplicon data, we can extract taxonomic and community structure
      information from shotgun data. Different approaches can be used: <ul>
        <li>Same approaches as for amplicon data with identification and classification of OTUs. Such approaches imply a first step of sequence sorting to extract only the 16S and 18S sequences on which the same tools as for amplicon data. However, rRNA sequences represent a low proportion (< 1%) of the shotgun sequences so such an approach is not the most statistically supported</li>
        <li>Assignation of taxonomy on the whole sequences using databases with marker genes</li>
      </ul> In this tutorial, we use the second approach with MetaPhlAn2. This
      tools is using a database of ~1M unique clade-specific marker genes (not
      only the rRNA genes) identified from ~17,000 reference (bacterial,
      archeal, viral and eukaryotic) genomes.

      HUMAnN2 generates 3 files.<br>

      The first file is a file with the abundance of gene families.<br> Gene
      family abundance is reported in RPK (reads per kilobase) units to
      normalize for gene length. It reflects the relative gene (or transcript)
      copy number in the community.<br> "UNMAPPED" value is the total number of
      reads which remain unmapped after both alignment steps (nucleotide and
      translated search). Since other gene features in the table are quantified
      in RPK units, "UNMAPPED" can be interpreted as a single unknown gene of
      length 1 kilobase recruiting all reads that failed to map to known
      sequences.
