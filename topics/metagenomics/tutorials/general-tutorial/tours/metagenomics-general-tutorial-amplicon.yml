      sequences that vary in length between 80 and 275 bases. Also, note that at
      least some of our sequences had some ambiguous base calls. Furthermore, at
      least one read had a homopolymer stretch of 31 bases, this is likely an
      error so we would like to filter such reads out as well.<br> If you are

      The main questions when analyzing amplicon data are: Which micro-organisms

      to take the sequences and assign them to a taxon. To do that, we group (or
      cluster) sequences based on their similarity to define Operational
      Taxonomic Units (OTUs); groups of similar sequences that can be treated as

      sequences by group and then sort them by abundance and go from most
      abundant to least and identify sequences that differ no more than 2
      nucleotides from on another. If this is the case, then they get merged. We
      generally recommend allowing 1 difference for every 100 basepairs of

      Once we have information about the community structure (OTUs with

      analysis of populations, … We will not go into detail of such analyses here but you
      follow our tutorials on amplicon data analyses to learn about them.
