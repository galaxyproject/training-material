## Metagenomics

---

## Overview

- Applications of metagenomics
- Amplicon (16S) Approach
- Shotgun Approach


---

## Applications

- **Environmental Studies**
- **Clinical**
  - Humans are full of microorganisms affecting health, drug efficacy, etc

---

## Amplicon


- Targetted approach (e.g. 16S/18S rRNA gene)
- Amplifies bacteria, not host or environmental fungi, plants

---

## Amplicon

- Highly conserved gene: easy to target across all bacteria
- With variable regions: distinguish between genus

![](../images/16S_variableregions.jpg)

???
V1, V2 etc are the variable regions

---

## Amplicon

- Pros
  - Well-established
  - Inexpensive ($50-$100/sample)
- Cons
 - V-region choice can bias results
 - Is based on a very well conserved gene, making it hard to resolve species and strains


???
18S gene also amplifies archaea

---

## Shotgun metagenomics

- Aims to sequence the "whole" metagenome

- Pros:
  - Not biased by amplicon primer set
  - Not limited by conservation of the amplicon
  - Can also provide functional information

- Cons:
  - Environmental contamination, including host
  - More expensive ($1000+/sample)
  - Complex data analysis
    - Requires high performance computing, high memory, high compute capacity

## End-to-End

Every step in this process can have serious impact on the results

---

## Bioinformatics

![](../images/so_much_data.png)

```
Roche 454 GS:    ~ 100.000 reads
Illumina MiSeq:  ~ 25.000.000 reads
Shotgun:             ~ ? reads
```

## Analysis pipelines

![](../images/metagenomics_pipeline.png)

---

## Pre-processing

![](../images/preprocessing.png)

- There are a lot of ways to filter and trim your data
- Trade-off between quality and amount of information retained

---

## Chimera Removal

- During PCR multiple sequences can combine to form a hybrid
- Must be removed from your data for better results

---

## OTU Clustering

Cluster on 97% sequence similarity for genus-level differentiation

## Search marker database and taxonomy assignment

- Homology with reference databases
  - Amplicon

    ![](../images/silva-greengenes.png)

  - Shotgun: MetaPhlAn2 database
      - ~1M unique clade-specific marker genes
      - ~17,000 reference genomes (bacterial and archaeal, viral and eukaryotic)

- Accuracy depends on quality and completeness of database used
- Databases are inevitable incomplete

---

## Search functional database

- Databases to identify gene families
    - UniRef50
    - UniRef90
- Grouping in other functional categories
    - MetaCyc Reactions
    - KEGG Orthogroups (KOs)
    - Pfam domains
    - Level-4 enzyme commission (EC) categories
    - EggNOG (including COGs)
    - Gene Ontology (GO)
    - Informative GO
- Pathway reconstruction
