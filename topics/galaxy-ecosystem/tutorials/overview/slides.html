# Galaxy is a big project 

- 2016: A small and unusual open source project appeared
- Code was run on real hardware to provide a free analysis service.
- For absolutely anyone who wanted to use it.
- Mostly genomics tools and data sources.
- There were many other self governed, multi-investigator open science collaborations.
- "Eating your own dogfood" to provide service was innovative
- A ready supply of bugs, and great ideas for improvement.
- Soon attracting users, contributors and collaborators.
- Has grown into an open, global self-governing collaboration.
- Based on enduring relationships
- Network of interacting grants support source and many other services 

???

- The Galaxy project has become so big and complicated that describing all the pieces and how they fit together is a challenge.

- It has grown organically over 15+ years, to the point where there are few individuals with enough time to understand and engage fully with the many activities of the diverse project components outlined below.

# Where does all the complexity come from?

- A global, self governing collaboration
- Dozens of collaborating grants supporting free services and source code
- Hundreds of active contributors
- Tens of thousands of daily scientist-users
- 8000+ tools in the toolshed

Galaxy’s complexity is a reflection of being an element in the rapidly evolving and global domain of Open Science. Planning and structures have always needed flexibility, to meet the changing needs of researchers. 

Historically, Galaxy arose from an open source repository that powered a free, on-line analysis service in 2006. It was highly innovative and quickly attracted users, collaborators and research grant support. 

Today, it is a self-governing, global open science collaboration, that not only maintains, but also adds value to the core framework source code, by delivering popular open science resources including free analysis services with integrated training material.

### Why encourage contribution and collaboration?

Community engagement, contribution and collaboration have always been welcomed and encouraged, because these drive improvement, expansion and long term sustainability for open science projects.

Some Galaxy project activities, such as the source code and the free usegalaxy.* analysis services, are widely appreciated and heavily used. 

These are the most obvious parts of the project, but they are made possible and supported by a much larger and complicated ecosystem of interacting and collaborating activities.

### What is this module for? 

There are many interacting parts and it can be hard to see how these all fit together and even harder to identify contribution opportunities and pathways. 

This training module is designed to provide a big picture view of how the project really works, and to introduce all of the important structures and processes that are currently in place. 

As will be seen, it is a big, complicated ecosystem, with many different participants and interactions. 

The material that follows represents our best effort to identify the main structures and processes, and how these interact to support all the project activities. 

Some of the descriptions and details provided here are likely to be at least a little bit wrong by the time this is being read, because the project has reached a point where growth and change are very rapid.

### Anatomy of major components that form the project

The descriptive subcategories below are arbitrary and non-exclusive, because many individuals, structures and processes fit into more than one category. 

There is no single, obvious “best” way to describe an open science collaborative ecosystem, or established terminology for the components or interactions. 

For example, collaborators, developers and users are individuals who are also members of various communities. 

These are described in artificially separated sections, but they interact and work together to create an important part of the global open science  ecosystem.
Contributors: Collaborations sustaining project activities.

Galaxy has always been an open and collaborative effort that has grown organically over time to include a large number of individuals who contribute regularly. 

Collaborating investigators who hold independent grants support core project resources, needed to support the source code, the free usegalaxy.* analysis services, the Galaxy Training Network, and many other popular and widely used deliverables. 

Free Galaxy analysis services are not sustainable without grant support, because they consume substantial computational resources and highly skilled staff effort. 

Even with these resources, maintaining and expanding these heavily used services also depends on contributions from another and much larger group of community members. 

The project could not have been so productive and successful without both grant funding and individual highly skilled community members contributing their effort.  

Galaxy’s complexity provides many opportunities for contribution, such as:

The source code repository is open to any developer, allowing issues to be raised and allowing pull request to be submitted for review in the usual way. 
The GTN offers tutorials and support to build presentations and hands-on tutorials applying real Galaxy tools in analyses for teaching
The IUC provides best practice guidance and GTN training modules to help developers build new tool wrappers for Galaxy, and automated infrastructure to help maintain them efficiently.
The GGSC offers opportunities for motivated community members to initiate and lead community development collaborations that can help the project to expand into activities that help support and expand subcommunities of users.
Working groups provide opportunities for the contribution of technical and other skills in focussed project areas ranging from GUI development through to training and outreach.

In the past, many community members have become highly valued contributors by finding their own particular way to join in.

More recently, effort is being devoted to documenting and clarifying the process, to make it far easier to navigate, for all kinds of contributors. 

This training module is part of that effort and there is a separate module on contributor pathways and stories to help show how many useful contributions have been made.
