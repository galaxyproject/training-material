# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

Galaxy is a great solution to train the bioinformatics concepts:

- numerous bioinformatics tools are available (almost 5,000 in the ToolShed)
- it can be used by people without amy computer science skills
- it trains to use technology, outlining available resources and efforts that have made them accessible to researchers
- it is scalable

In 2016, the Galaxy Training Network decide to set up a new infrastructure for delivering easily Galaxy related training material. The idea was to develop something open and online based on a community effort, as always in Galaxy.

We took inspiration from [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) and collected everything on a GitHub repository: [https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material ](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material).
We decided on a structure based on tutorials with hands-on, fitting both for online self-training but also for workshops, grouped in topics. Each tutorial follows the same structure and comes with a virtualised isntance to run the training everywhere.

To able to run a tutorial, we need a Galaxy instance where the needed tools are installed along with the data. We need then to describe the needed technical infrastructure. This description can be be used to populate an existing Galaxy instance or to automatically set up a Docker Galaxy flavour and also to test if a public Galaxy instance is able to run the tool.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to extract the technical infrastructure for a tutorial, how to prepare an existing Galaxy and how to create a virtualised Galaxy instance, based on Docker, to run your training - either on normal computers or cloud environments.

# Extracting the technical details to support your training

Once you wrote the tutorial in the `tutorial.md`, you need to create other files to detail the requirements for the tutorial:

- Workflow files
- `tools.yaml` file
- `data-library.yaml` file
- `data-manager.yaml` file

## Extracting workflows

The first step is to to extract workflows with the different steps of the tutorial and add them to the `workflows` directory in the tutorial. These files can be used to extract the needed tools and also to run and test a tutorial automatically on a Galaxy instance.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Extract the workflow
>
> 1. Extract the workflow for the tutorial
> 2. Add some description about the tutorial in a `README.md` file with the workflow file
{: .hands_on}

## Filling the `tools.yaml`

Once you have the workflow, you can extract from it the required tools into the `tools.yaml` file. This file contains the description of the required tools that could be installed from the ToolShed:

```
---
api_key: admin
galaxy_instance: http://localhost:8080
install_resolver_dependencies: True
install_tool_dependencies: False
tools:
- name: tool1
  owner: owner
  tool_panel_section_label: "Section1"
- name: tool2
  owner: owner
  tool_panel_section_label: "Section2"
```

with:

- `name`: the name of the wrapper of the tool in the ToolShed
- `owner`: the owner of the wrapper of the tool in the ToolShed
- `tool_panel_section_label`: section where to put the tool (in the left panel in the Galaxy instance)

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Fill the `tools.yaml`
>
> 1. Add the BLAST tool into the `tools.yaml` file
{: .hands_on}

This list of tools can be automatically extracted from the workflow using [Ephemeris](https://ephemeris.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (which should be in the conda environment):

```
$ workflow-to-tools -w path/to/worflow -o path/to/tools.yaml
```

After the extraction, some formatting is needed:

1. Add at the beginning:

    ```
    ---
    api_key: admin
    galaxy_instance: http://localhost:8080
    ```

2. Change the `tool_panel_section_label` to something more informative

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Fill the `tools.yaml` from your workflow
>
> 1. Fill the `tools.yaml` file using your workflow and Ephemeris
> 2. Format the `tools.yaml` file correctly
{: .hands_on}

## Filling the `data-library.yaml`

The data can also be integrated in the Galaxy instance inside a data libraries and then make the data shared between the users. It lets then avoid every trainees to redownload the input data.

We recommend to put the data on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).

Such data are described in the `data-library.yaml`:

```
libraries:
    - name: Name of the tutorial
      files:
        - url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgruening/galaxytools/master/tools/rna_tools/sortmerna/test-data/read_small.fasta"
          file_type: fasta
        - url: ""
          file_type: ""
```

with:

- `name`: name of the tutorial, where to put the data in the data libraries
- `files`: list of the files to download
    - `url`: URL to the input file
    - `file-type`: type of the input file

The URL must refer to the URL of the files in Zenodo.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Fill the `data-library.yaml`
>
> 1. Add the input files into the `data-library.yaml` file
> 2. Add the link to Zenodo in the `metadata.yaml` file
{: .hands_on}

## Filling the `data-manager.yaml`

Some of the tools require specific databases, specifically prepared for the tool. Then some Galaxy tools come with data managers to manage these databases.

If you need such data managers for your tool, you can describe their running with the `data-manager.yaml` file:

```
data_managers:
    - id: url to data manager on ToolShed
      params:
        - 'param1': '{{ item }}'
        - 'param2': 'value'
      # Items refere to a list of variables you want to run this data manager. You can use them inside the param field with {{ item }}
      # In case of genome for example you can run this DM with multiple genomes, or you could give multiple URLs.
      items:
        - item1
        - item2
      # Name of the data-tables you want to reload after your DM are finished. This can be important for subsequent data managers
      data_table_reload:
        - all_fasta
        - __dbkeys__
```

## Adding a Galaxy Interactive Tour

A Galaxy Interactive Tour is a way to go through an entire analysis, step by step inside Galaxy in an interactive and explorative way.
It is a great way to run the tutorial directly inside Galaxy. To learn more about creating a Galaxy tour please have a look at our [dedicated tour training]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/training/tutorials/create-new-tutorial-tours/tutorial.html).

# Population a Galaxy instance for your training

TO FILL

# Building a Galaxy instance specifically for your training

Every topic will come with a Docker image containing the tools, data, workflows and Galaxy Interactive Tours required by each tutorial of this topic. The Docker image is described in the Dockerfile found in the `docker` directory of each topic. This file uses scripts to automatically add the files for each tutorial. The only thing to change is the name of the topic in the Dockerfile copied from the templates.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Testing the Docker
>
> 1. Check that the Dockerfile uses 'sequence-analysis' as topic name
> 2. Move to the root of the training material repository
> 3. Build the Docker image for the topic with: `docker build -f topic/sequence-analysis/docker/Dockerfile -t training-sequence-analysis .`
>     
>    This command needs to be launched a the root of training material repository because the Dockerfile uses some scripts available there to install the tools, import the data and the workflows
>
> 4. Launch the Docker container: `docker run -d -p 8080:80 training-sequence-analysis`
> 5. Check the Galaxy instance on [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/):
>     1. Check the installed tools
>     2. Check the data libraries in "Shared data"
>     3. Check the workflows
>     4. Check the Galaxy Interactive Tours in "Help"
