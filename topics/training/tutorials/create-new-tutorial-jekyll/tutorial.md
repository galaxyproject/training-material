# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

Galaxy is a great solution to train the bioinformatics concepts:

- numerous bioinformatics tools are available (almost 5,000 in the ToolShed)
- it can be used by people without amy computer science skills
- it trains to use technology, outlining available resources and efforts that have made them accessible to researchers
- it is scalable

In 2016, the Galaxy Training Network decide to set up a new infrastructure for delivering easily Galaxy related training material. The idea was to develop something open and online based on a community effort, as always in Galaxy.

We took inspiration from [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) and collected everything on a GitHub repository: [https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material ](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material).
We decided on a structure based on tutorials with hands-on, fitting both for online self-training but also for workshops, grouped in topics. Each tutorial follows the same structure and comes with a virtualised instance to run the training everywhere.

If you want to run the entire GTN website locally or test your new training material you can do this!

Currently, the website is generated from the metadata and the tutorials using Jekyll, a simple static site builder.
We can use Jekyll to run a server to check if the tutorial is correctly added and rendered.

# Installation of the requirements

The first step is to install the requirements inside a conda environment. This step has to be done once.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Install the requirements
>
> 1. Install [conda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
> 2. Navigate to `training-material/` folder
> 3. Create the conda environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
> 4. Activate the conda environment: `source activate galaxy_training_material`
> 5. Install Jekyll and related modules using [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download): `make install`
{: .hands_on}

# Checking the website generation

Once Jekyll and its modules are installed in our conda environment, we can check the generation of the website locally:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Checking the website generation locally
>
> 1. (If not done) Activate the conda environment: `source activate galaxy_training_material`
> 1. Run a local Jekyll server with `make serve`
> 2. Visualize at [http://localhost:4000/training-material/ ](http://localhost:4000/training-material/)
>
>    > ### {% icon question %} Questions

>    >    <summary>Click to view answers</summary>
>    >    Please check [http://localhost:4000/training-material/topics/ ](http://localhost:4000/training-material/topics/) to get a list of topics.
>    >    </details>
>    {: .question}
{: .hands_on}

With `make serve`, a local Jekyll server will run in background. It will check the changes and regenerate the website accordingly. You may need to reload the page to see the changes (and sometimes to wait 1-2 minutes)

Once you are done, you can stop the server with `ctrl-c` and deactivate your conda environment with `source deactivate`.

# Generating PDF of the tutorials and slides

A PDF file of every tutorials and slide decks can be generated, using Chrome on command line and [Decktape](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape).

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Checking the website generation locally
>
> 1. (If not done) Activate the conda environment: `source activate galaxy_training_material`
> 1. Install Chrome
>    - For OSX, install the [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)
>    - For Ubuntu, follow [these instructions](https://askubuntu.com/questions/510056/how-to-install-google-chrome#510186)
> 2. Run `make pdf`
> 3. Check the PDF in `_pdf` folder
