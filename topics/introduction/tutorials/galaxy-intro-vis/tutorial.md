:dart: ***Objectives***

- *First objective of this tutorial (It is a single sentence describing what a learner will be able to do once they have sat through the lesson. The objectives must be technical, but also theoretical, objectives. You can check [SWC lessons](https://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/) to help you writing learning objectives.)*

:hourglass: ***Time estimation*** *1d/3h/6h*

# Introduction

General introduction about the topic and then an introduction of the tutorial (the questions and the objectives). It is nice also to have a scheme to sum up the pipeline used during the tutorial. The idea is to give to trainees insight into the content of the tutorial and the (theoretical and technical) key concepts they will learn.

It could be nice to use: [Using the Integrative Genomics Viewer]({{site.url}}/topics/introduction/tutorials/igv-introduction/tutorial.html)
