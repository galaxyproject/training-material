{: .question}

To explore this question we need a basic understanding of *genomes, chromosomes, strands,* and  *genes.*

> <comment-title>Definitions 1</comment-title>
>
> - **Genome**
>
>   The genome is the collection of all DNA native to an organism. For humans, the genome is all of a person's chromosomes.
>
> - **Chromosome**
>
>   The largest unit of DNA organization in an organism.  Humans have two copies of 23 chromosomes.  Chromosomes are *linear* in humans, and all animals and plants.  (Bacteria have *circular* chromosomes.)

The question we are asking looks like:

![Does a situation like this exist?](../../images/do_genes_on_opposite_strands_ever_overlap.png)

*Non-overlapping genes are common.  How common are overlapping genes?*

# Get human data

To answer this question we need to know where genes start and stop on human chromosomes.  That seems like a simple question, but if you are new to bioinformatics it's actually a hard question to answer.  Web searches will land you at any number of useful places on the web, but without a lot of background knowledge it's hard to know what you want:  *What's the difference between sequence and annotation?  What are FASTA, BED, GTF, GFF3, and VCF?  What are GRCh37, GRCh38, hg19, and hg38 (and what happened to hg20 through hg37 - are they okay)?*

It turns out that for this particular question (and for many others), most **Galaxy** instances can help us find this information.

{: .hands_on}

The Galaxy interface consists of three main parts. The available tools are listed on the left, your analysis history is recorded on the right, and the central panel will show the home page, tool forms, and dataset content.

## Get data into Galaxy

There are [many ways to get data into a Galaxy instance]({% link topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/get-data/slides.html %}). We are going to use the **Get Data** toolbox in the **Tools** panel on the left.

> <hands-on-title>Open Get Data toolbox</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. *Click* on the **Get Data** toolbox to expand it.
>
>    ![The Get Data toolbox](../../images/getdata.PNG)
>
{: .hands_on}

The **Get Data** toolbox contains a list of data sources that this Galaxy instance can get data directly from.  **Upload file** is quite useful for getting data from your computer or from the web (see the [Getting data into Galaxy slides]({% link topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/get-data/slides.html %})).  Today we are going to use the **UCSC Main table browser**.

### Get genes

> <hands-on-title>Go to UCSC</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. *Click* on the tool {% tool [UCSC Main table browser](ucsc_table_direct1) %} to go to UCSC.
>
>    ![Click on UCSC Main table browser](../../images/101_01.png)
>
{: .hands_on}

This will take you to the UCSC Table Browser:

 ![UCSC table browser tool, first screen for genes](../../images/ucsc_table_browser_w_default_settings.png)

The [UCSC Table Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables) provides access to all the data that is shown in the [UCSC Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway) (see box below). If you are working on a species that UCSC supports (like human) then the Table Browser is a great place to get genomic data.

The Table Browser has a daunting number of options. Fortunately, they are all set to commonly used defaults, greatly simplifying things, and most of the options are already set to what we want:

* **clade:** `Mammal`
* **genome:** `Human`
* **assembly:** `Dec. 2013 (GRCh38/hg38)`
* **group:** `Genes and Gene Predictions`
* **track:** `GENCODE v41`

**clade** and **genome** seem pretty clear.  **assembly** asks which version/definition of the human genome we want.  (Any will do for our question, but UCSC is suggesting `hg38`, which is also the most recent.)  **group** is set to `Genes and Gene Predictions` which sounds like what we want. So far so good.

**track** has a bewildering list of options. UCSC suggests `GENCODE v41`.  A web search leads us to the [GENCODE web site](https://www.gencodegenes.org/) which prominently states:

> <warning-title>ALL GENCODE is different from GENCODE</warning-title>
> **Warning** The Table browser only provides the most recent release of GENCODE which is updated several times per year. ALL GENCODE does not contain the same data as GENCODE and you should select the GENCODE track even if the version number is wrong. 
{: .warning}

>The goal of the GENCODE project is to identify and classify all gene features in the human and mouse genomes with high accuracy based on biological evidence...
{: .quote}

Time for a few more definitions.

> <comment-title>Definitions 2</comment-title>
>
> - **Reference genome**
>
>    A reference genome is the *genome of a single individual* that has been thoroughly studied, to the point that we know exactly what most of that individual's DNA is.  In practice a reference genome is used as shared map by researchers working on that organism. Reference genomes are updated periodically as techniques improve.
>
> - **Sequence**
>
>   A genome's sequence describes the DNA in that genome, down to the A, C, T, and G (single nucleotide) level including the exact location where each is.  Given a reference genome, you can ask questions like, "What's the DNA on chromosome 2 between positions 1,678,901 and 1.688,322?"
>
> - **Genome/Gene annotation**
>
>   The sequence tells us what DNA is where, but it doesn't tell us anything about the function of that DNA.  *Annotation* is additional information about particular regions of the genome like where genes, repeats, promotors, and centromeres are, or how active a particular gene is.
{: .comment}

The **track** option asks us which set of annotations do we want to get?  There are so many choices because annotation is the result of analysis and interpretation, and there are many ways to do this. (And in this case, many of the options aren't even genes or gene predictions.)

GENCODE is "high-quality" and  "gene annotation." That sounds like a good thing to use.  Lets stay with the default: `GENCODE V41`.

So far we haven't changed *anything* from the defaults.  Lets change something.  The default  **region** is the whole genome, which can be done, but it's a lot of information. For this exercise lets use just one (small) chromosome.

> <hands-on-title>Limit the region and get the data.</hands-on-title>

{: .hands_on}

This returns us to Galaxy, first displaying a big green box (that's good!) and then returning us to the view we started with.  Except that we now have an item in our history, the dataset from UCSC.


### History Item Status

Watch your new history item.  It will go through three statuses before it's done.

| Color | Icon | Meaning | |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Grey** | Clock | Item is waiting to start (waiting for data transfer to start) | ![Status: Queued](../../images/status_queued.png) |
| **Yellow** | Spinner | Item is running (data is actively being transferred). | ![Status: Running](../../images/status_running.png) |
| **Green** | None | Item has finished successfully (data transfer complete). | ![Status: Successfully finished](../../images/status_finished_success.png) |
| **Red**  | Cross | The job has failed. There can be [many reasons](https://galaxyproject.org/support/tool-error/). | ![Status: Failed](../../images/status_failed.png) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |

You can find more information in the [Undestanding Galaxy history system](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/history/tutorial.html) training.

## Examine the data

> <hands-on-title>Look at the data.</hands-on-title>
> Once the dataset is green, *click* on the dataset name (something like **UCSC Main on Human...**)
{: .hands_on}

This expands the dataset and shows you information about it, and a preview of its contents.

![Preview of the data from UCSC Table Browser](../../images/genes_human_chr22_preview.png)

From this preview we can obtain a huge amount of useful information:
1. The dataset has over 4000 regions, meaning that there are over 4000 genes on chromosome 22.
1. The dataset is in **BED** format, one of several standards for representing genome annotation.  We got BED format because BED was preselected as the output format in the UCSC table browser.
1. The dataset's "database" is **hg38**.  This says which revision of the reference genome this data maps too.  hg38 is the latest human reference genome.  hg38 was also selected by default in UCSC.
1. Finally, it shows us the first 5 rows in the dataset.

The dataset preview is informative, but you can't see much of the actual dataset.  Lets use one of the dataset icons to see the whole dataset:

## Naming

Galaxy allows you to name your analyses (your histories) and your datasets.  We only have one history ("Unnamed history") and one dataset ("UCSC Main on Human:...") so far, but it's a good idea to

1. Always name your histories
2. Name your input and final output datasets, and any significant intermediate datasets.

You don't have to do this.  Galaxy is quite happy for you to have an infinite number of "Unnamed history" histories, and to have all your datasets be obscurely named.  However, once you've run your first 5 unnamed analyses, all with obscurely named datasets, you'll might wish you would have named everything.

# We've got the data - what's our plan for answering the question?

You have to know what's possible, before you can build a plan.  If you don't have experience with data analysis then you might not have any idea how you would answer our question.  Before we dive in using a particular solution, think about how you might solve this.  If you don't have any experience with tools, then think about how you might solve it manually, using pencil and paper (it may help to assume you have an infinite supply of helpers to do the pencil and paper work).

Here's how we'll answer this question:

1. Split the genes dataset in two: one for genes on the forward strand, and one for genes on the reverse strand.
1. Compare the two datasets to see which ones, if any, overlap.
1. Check how many (or what percentage) of our genes overlap with another gene.

It turns out that all of these steps are easy in Galaxy!

### Split the genes into forward and reverse datasets

How might we do this?  Column 6 contains the strand information.  Can we split genes into two datasets based on the value of Column 6.  How?  Lets take a look at our available tools.  And *whoa! There are over 40 toolboxes, and several hundred tools.* How are we going to find a tool that can do the split?


> <hands-on-title>Searching for and launching a tool</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Try the **tools search box**.  Think of terms that might describe what we want to do and type them in the search box.  Do you see anything promising?  Explore a little.
> 2. If you haven't already searched with it, *enter* `filter` in the **tool search box**.  Among the results you should see
>    - {% tool [Filter](Filter1) %} data on any column using simple expressions.
>    - That might work.
> 3. *Click* on {% tool [Filter](Filter1) %} to open the Filter tool in the central panel.
> 4. Take a look at the **Syntax** and **Example** sections to understand what the tool does.
>
> ![The Filter Tool form](../../images/filter_tool_defaults.png)
{: .hands_on}

It doesn't say anything about **Filter** being able to split a file into multiple files.  It does look like we can use Filter to get only genes on the forward strand, or only genes on the reverse strand.  We would have to run Filter twice, once for forward strand genes, and once for reverse strand genes. Let's do that.

> <hands-on-title>Run the Filter tool to get genes on the forward strand.</hands-on-title>
>
> * The filter tool has 3 fields:
>
>   1. **Dataset**: This pulldown will list any dataset from your history that this tool can work on.  In your case that's probably only one dataset. {% icon param-files %} *"filter"*: `Genes chr22` .
>   2. **Condition**: this free text field is where we specify which records we want in the output dataset. Put in *"Condition"*:  `c6 == "+" ` .
>       This specifies that column 6 (the strand) must be equal to (`==` is Python for *is equal to*) a plus sign.
>   3.  *"Header lines to skip"*:  `0 `
>
>       Our dataset does not have any header lines.
>
> * Finally, *click* the **Execute** button.
>
>   ![Run the Filter tool to get only the forward strand genes](../../images/filter_tool_forward_strand_genes_only.png)
>
{: .hands_on}

This adds another dataset to your history. This one should contain only genes on the forward strand.  Once the dataset is green, click the {% icon galaxy-eye %} (eye) icon to confirm this. We also recommend that you rename this dataset to something like `Genes, forward strand` (remember how?).

Now we want to get the genes on the reverse strand.  There are actually many ways to get this.  Here are two of them.

> <hands-on-title>Get genes on the reverse strand</hands-on-title>
>
> **Method 1**
>
> 1. Open the dataset preview by *clicking* on the name of the `Genes, forward strand` dataset.  This shows an icon than the uploaded `Genes chr22` dataset did not: a looping arrow.

>
> **Both Methods**
> 1. *Rename* your new dataset to something like `Genes, reverse strand`
{: .hands_on}

The rerun button can be a huge help as you run more complex tools.

> <comment-title>Empty result?</comment-title>
>
> If you used Method 2 and didn't explicitly set the dataset, then you ran Filter on the `Genes, forward strand` dataset. None of the genes in the forward strand dataset have "-" in column 6 so all of them were filtered out from the result.

{: .comment}


Your history should now have (at least) 3 datasets in it, with names like:

* `Genes chr22`
* `Genes, forward strand`
* `Genes, reverse strand`

The number of genes in the `forward` plus `reverse` datasets should be the same as in the `Genes chr22` dataset.  If they aren't can you figure out why?

### Check for overlaps

Genes are an example of a *genomic interval*.

> <comment-title>Definitions 3</comment-title>
>
> - **Genomic interval**
>   In Galaxy, a *genomic interval* is a something that spans part of a chromosome (or some other linear frame of reference like a contig).  Genes are a common example of a genomic interval.  Even a chromosome is a genomic interval, albeit a very long one.
{: .comment}

Galaxy excels at answering questions about genomic intervals and different sets of genomic intervals relate to each other.  Lets take a look.

> <hands-on-title>Genomic Interval Tools</hands-on-title>
>
> * The next step is finding overlapping intervals, so type `interval` in the tool search box. There are many results from this search, so you might want to click the *Show sections* button (available on Galaxy servers) to see which sections the tools are organised into.
> * *Explore* the tools in this toolbox, looking for something that we can use to see which genes on opposite strands overlap.
{: .hands_on}

Of the tools in the **Operate on Genomic Intervals** toolbox, **Join** and particularly **Intersect** have the most promise.  Let's try **Intersect**.

> <hands-on-title>Genomic Interval Tools</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [Intersect](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/intersect/gops_intersect_1/0.0.1) %} with the following parameters:
>     - *"Return"*:  `Overlapping Intervals`.
>       This looks like it might return whole genes, while `Overlapping pieces` may return only the parts that overlap.  We suspect that whole genes might be more useful.
>     - {% icon param-files %}*"of"*:  `Genes, forward strand` (the first dataset)
>     - {% icon param-files %} *"that intersect"* : `Genes, reverse strand` (the second dataset)
>     - *"for at least"*: `1`
>       
>       This will return genes with even just one position overlapping.
>     - *Click* **Execute**.
>
>     ![Run Intersect](../../images/genes_human_intersect_strands.png)
>
> 3. Now repeat the intersect, but make the first dataset be the reverse genes, and the second be the forward genes.
>
> 4. Finally give both of the new datasets meaningful names, like `Overlapping forward genes` and `Overlapping reverse genes`
{: .hands_on}


## Results and final steps.

At this point we *could* say that we have answered our question. Using dataset previews in the history panel, we can compare the number of genes in the `Overlapping forward` and `Overlapping reverse` datasets with the number of genes in the full `Genes chr22` dataset, and *conclude that overlapping genes on opposite strands are actually pretty common.*

However, before we rush off to publish our conclusions, let's

1. Get both the forward and reverse overlapping genes into a single dataset (one link will look better in our publication), and
2. *Visualize* our new dataset, just to double-check our results.

### Combine forward and reverse overlapping genes into one dataset.

What tool can we use to combine the two datasets into one?  Try *searching* for `combine` or `join` or `stack` in the tool search box.  You'll find lots of tools, but none of them do what we want to do. *Some times you just have to manually look through toolboxes to find what you need.*  Where should we look?  It's probably not **Get Data** or **Send Data**, but it could easily be in any of the next 4 toolboxes: **Lift-Over, Collection Operations, Text Manipulation, or Datamash**.

It turns out that **Lift-Over** and **Collection Operations** are not what we want.  (But, take a look at them: if you are going to work with genomic data it won't take long before you'll need both.)

> <hands-on-title>Concatenate two datasets</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. *Open* the **Text Manipulation** toolbox.
> 2. Near the top of the toolbox is **Concatenate datasets tail-to-head**. *Click* on it.  Lets try that tool.
> 3. {% tool [Concatenate](cat1) %} with the following parameters:
>   - {% icon param-files %} *"Concatenate Dataset"*: `Overlapping reverse genes`.
>   - *"Dataset*"
>      - Click on {% icon param-repeat %} *"Insert Dataset"*
>      
>         This adds a second dataset pull-down menu to the form.
>
>      - In *"1: Dataset"*      
>         - {% icon param-files %} *"Select"*: `Overlapping forward genes` as the second dataset.
> 4. *Click* **Execute**
> 5. *Rename* the resulting dataset something informative like `Overlapping genes`
{: .hands_on}

Once the concatenate operation is finished, preview the dataset in your history panel.  Does it have the expected number of genes in it?  If not, see if you can figure out what happened.

### Visualize the overlapping genes

Galaxy knows about several visualization options for lots of different dataset types, including BED.  Whenever you preview a dataset in the history panel, Galaxy provides links to these visualizations.  For BED files (which is the format we have), options include **IGB, IGV,** and **UCSC main.**  IGB and IGV are widely used desktop applications and eventually you may want to install one or both of them.  For now, let's visualize the data at UCSC, using the UCSC *Genome* Browser.

The [UCSC Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway) (and most genome browsers) typically display different types of *annotation* about a region of a genome.

Now, take a look at one of our results.  (Any pair of overlapping genes will do.)  Our data is in the second to top track (**User Track / User Supplied Track**). That track shows a line of small black boxes, sometimes connected with a line.

The black boxes connected by lines represent genes, and each set of connected boxes is a single gene (actually, a single transcript of a gene).  Take a close look at the top several tracks.

* It looks like we preserved the gene definitions just fine.
* It looks like, sure enough, there are overlapping genes here, and they are on opposite sides.  The arrows on the connecting lines tell us which strand the gene is on.

Um, *what's up with the boxes and the lines connecting them?*

As you may have guessed (or already knew): The black boxes are exons.  *Genes* are defined as *covering the entire area from the first black box to the last connected black box.*

## Do we have a problem?

*Maybe.*

Our *ad hoc* review of identified overlapping genes in the UCSC Genome Browser has *(or should have!)* confirmed that every gene we said has an overlapping gene on the opposite strand does in fact have that.  So, our conclusion appears solid: A significant percentage of genes *do* overlap with other genes on the opposite strand.

But, our conclusion may not be as *significant* as we had hoped. If only parts of genes, the exons, make stuff in our bodies, then should we have run this analysis on just the exons rather then the entire genes?  Probably.

Let's refine our question slightly

> <question-title>Our Revised Motivating Question</question-title>
> *I wonder if **exons** on opposite strands ever overlap with each other, and if so, how common is that?*
{: .question}


### So, I have to do this all over again, but with exons?

*Well, yes and no.*  We will have to run the analysis again, this time on exons instead of whole genes. But we won't have to manually recreate every step of our analysis. Galaxy enables us to create a reusable *workflow* from the analysis we just did, and then we can rerun the analysis, as one step, anytime we want to, and on any dataset.

## Walk through the workflow tutorial

Run the [Create a reusable workflow from a history]({% link topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/history-to-workflow/tutorial.md %}) tutorial for how to do this, *and then come back here to run your newly created workflow with the exon data.*

## Rerun analysis with exon data

We want to run the same analysis, but this time only look for overlaps that happen in *exons*, the parts of genes that produce stuff our body uses.  Before we start looking at exons, let's start a new history, one that contains only the genes file we got from UCSC. We could go back to UCSC and refetch the file, but there is an easier way.

### Get the exon data

And your new history appears in the history panel with the copied *genes* dataset.  What we need is *exons.* How can we get the exon information?  There are two relatively easy ways to get this information, one of which will be very familiar.

The first method involves going back to the UCSC Table Browser.  Everything on the first form would stay the same: We still want human, hg38, GENCODE v41, and just `chr22`. The second form is what changes.  Instead of getting the **Whole Gene**, we need to retrieve the **Coding Exons** only.

The second method is to use the **Gene BED To Exon/Intron/Codon BED expander** tool in the **Operate on Genomic Intervals** toolbox to extract the exon information from the genes BED file we already have. (*Of course!* you say.  Umm, there is no way that you should have known that you already had this information in the genes file, or that this tool existed.)

> <hands-on-title>Get the exon data</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Get the exon information, either by revisiting UCSC, or by using the {% tool [Gene BED To Exon/Intron/Codon BED expander](gene2exon1) %} tool.  If you use the expander tool select **Coding Exons only** from the **Extract** pull-down.
> 2. Give the resulting dataset a meaningful name.
{: .hands_on}


If you got the data from UCSC it will look something like this:
![Contents of the exons dataset from UCSC](../../images/101_exons.png)


Your history should now have two datasets: one describing entire genes, and one describing just the exons.

### Rerun the analysis, this time on exons.

When you did the *History to Workflow* tutorial you created a new workflow that was then added to your list of defined workflows.

> <hands-on-title>Run the workflow on the exon data.</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. *Click* the **Workflow** tab in the menu at the top of the Galaxy page.
>
>    This lists all of your defined workflows, including the one you just created.
> 2. *Click* on the {% icon workflow-run %} (Run workflow) button next to your workflow.
>
>    This launches the workflow run form (which you also saw when testing this workflow)
> 3. *Select* **No** under **Send results to a new history**
>
>    If you do not see this option displayed, *click* on **Expand to full workflow form** to reveal it.
> 4. *Set* the first (and only) input dataset to the `Exons` dataset, using the pull-down menu.
> 5. *Click* the **Run workflow** button.
{: .hands_on}

And Galaxy launches the workflow and says (in a nice big green box) something like:

> You can check the status of queued jobs and view the resulting data by refreshing the History pane.
{: .quote}

Which in this case *is the truth*.  You can refresh the history panel by either reloading the whole page, of by clicking the looping arrow icon at the top of the history panel.  What you'll see is a stack of history steps that will go from queued to running to done as you watch them.

All steps in the history will be green when the workflow is done. Once that happens compare your output dataset with your input dataset?  What percentage of exons overlap with other exons on the opposite strand, and is it common or rare?  Is it a smaller percentage than we saw for whole genes?


## Are we done?

Probably.  Note that we can no longer say what percentage of *genes* overlap.  We *can* say what percentage of exons overlap, and that is probably close enough for our goals.  If it isn't and we actually need to say what percentage of genes overlap, then we will have to do some extra work.  This can be done is several ways, but the Galaxy 101 tutorial may give you some ideas on how to follow this question all the way to genes.
