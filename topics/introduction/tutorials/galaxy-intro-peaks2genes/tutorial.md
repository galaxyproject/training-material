# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

We stumbled upon a paper [Li et al., Cell Stem Cell 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22862943) that contains the analysis of possible target genes of an interesting protein in mice. The targets were obtained by ChIP-seq and the raw data is available through [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE37268).
The list of genes however is neither in the supplement of the paper nor part of the GEO submission.
The closest thing we could find is a list of the regions where the signal is significantly enriched (so called *peaks*):

1 | 3660676 | 3661050 | 375 | 210 | 62.0876250438913 | -2.00329386666667

1 | 3661976 | 3662325 | 350 | 275 | 48.3062708406486 | -1.29391285714286

**Table 1** Subsample of the available file

The goal of this exercise is to **turn this list of genomic regions into a list of possible target genes**.

Now we collected all the data we need to start our analysis.

# Part 1: Naive approach

## File preparation

Let's have a look at our files to see what we actually have here.

{: .hands_on}

> ### {% icon question %} Questions
>
> While the file from UCSC has labels for the columns, the peak file does not. Can you guess what the columns stand for?
>
{: .question}

This peak file is not in any standard format and just by looking at it, we cannot find out what the numbers in the different columns mean. In the paper the authors mention that they used the peak caller [HPeak](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20598134).

By looking at the HPeak manual we can find out that the columns contain the following information:

 - chromosome name by number
 - start coordinate
 - end coordinate
 - length
 - location within the peak that has the highest hypothetical DNA fragment coverage (summit)
 - not relevant
 - not relevant

In order to compare the two files, we have to make sure that the chromosome names follow the same format.
As we directly see, the peak file lacks `chr` before any chromosome number. But what happens with chromosome 20 and 21? Will it be X and Y instead? Let's check:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: View end of file
>
> 1. Search for **Select last** {% icon tool %} tool and run **Select last lines from a dataset (tail)** with the following settings:
>     - *"Text file"*: our peak file `GSE37268_mof3.out.hpeak.txt`
>     - *"Operation"*: `Keep last lines`
>     - *"Number of lines"*: Choose a value, e.g. `100`
> 2. Click **Execute**
> 3. Wait for the job to finish

>    >    > 2. The chromosomes X and Y are names 20 and 21
>    >    {: .solution }
>    {: .question}
{: .hands_on}

In order to convert the chromosome names we have therefore two things to do:

1. add `chr`
2. change 20 and 21 to X and Y

## Analysis

Our goal is still to compare the 2 region files (the genes file and the peak file from the publication)
to know which peaks are related to which genes. If you really only want to know which peaks are located **inside** genes you
can skip the next step. Otherwise, it might be reasonable to include the promoter region into the comparison, e.g. because
you want to include Transcriptions factors in ChIP-seq experiments.

>     - *"Offset"*: `10000`
>     - *"Length of the flanking region(s)"*: `12000`

{: .hands_on}

You might have noticed that the UCSC file is in `BED` format and has a database associated to it. That's what we want for our peak file as well

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Change format and database

> 1. Click on the {% icon galaxy-pencil %} (pencil) icon in the history entry of our peak region file

> 5. Check that the "Database/Build" is `mm9` (the database build for mice used in the paper)
{: .hands_on}

It's time to find the overlapping intervals (finally!). To do that, we want to extract the genes which overlap/intersect with our peaks.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Find Overlaps
>
> 1. **Intersect** {% icon tool %}: Run **Intersect the intervals of two datasets** with the following settings:

{: .hands_on}

We now have the list of genes (column 4) overlapping with the peak regions.
To get a better overview of the genes we obtained, we want to look at their distribution across the different chromosomes.
We will regroup the table by chromosome and count the number of genes with peaks on each chromosome

{: .hands_on}

## Visualization

Since we have some nice data, let's draw a barchart out of it!

## Extracting workflow

When you look carefully at your history, you can see that it contains all steps of our analysis, from the beginning to the end. By building this history we have actually built a complete record of our analysis with Galaxy preserving all parameter settings applied at every step.
Wouldn't it be nice to just convert this history into a workflow that we'll be able to execute again and again?

Galaxy makes this very simple with the `Extract workflow` option. This means that any time you want to build a workflow, you can just perform it manually once, and then convert it to a workflow, so that next time it will be a lot less work to do the same analysis. It also allows you to easily share or publish your analysis.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Extract workflow

By default all the outputs of a workflow will be shown, but we can explicitly tell Galaxy which output to show and which to hide for a given workflow. This behaviour is controlled by the little asterisk next to every output dataset:

>    > If you click on this asterisk for any of the output datasets, then *only* files with an asterisk will be shown, and all outputs without an asterisk will be hidden (Note that clicking *all* outputs has the same effect as clicking *none* of the outputs, in both cases all the datasets will be shown).

Now it's time to reuse our workflow for a more sophisticated approach.

# Part 2: More sophisticated approach

In part 1 we used an overlap definition of 1 bp (default setting). In order to get a more meaningful definition, we now want to use the information of the position of the peak summit and check for overlap of the summits with genes.

## Preparation

Create a new history and name it. If you forgot how to do that, you can have a look at the beginning of this tutorial.
The history is now empty, but we need our peak file again. Before we upload it twice, we can copy it from our former history:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Copy history items
>
> 1. Click on the **View all histories** ({% icon galaxy-columns %} icon) at the top right of your history
>
>       You should see both of your histories side-by-side now
>
> 2. Use drag-and-drop with your mouse to copy the edited peak file (after the replace steps) but still in interval format, which contains the summit information, to your new history.
> 3. Click on **Analyze Data** in the top panel to go back to your analysis window
>
{: .hands_on}

## Create peak summit file

We need to generate a new BED file from the original peak file that contains the positions of the peak summits. The start of the summit is the start of the peak (column 2) plus the location within the peak that has the highest hypothetical DNA fragment coverage (column 5). As the end we simply define `start + 1`.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Create peak summit file
>
> 1. **Compute** {% icon tool %}: Run **Compute an expression on every row** with the following settings:
>   - *"Add expression"*: `c2+c5`
>   - *"as a new column to"*: our peak file
>   - *"Round result?"*: `YES`
> 2. **Compute an expression on every row** {% icon tool %}: rerun this tool on the last result with:
>   - *"Add expression"*: `c8+1`
>   - *"as a new column to"*: the result from step 1
>   - *"Round result?"*: `YES`
>
{: .hands_on}

Now we cut out just the chromosome plus the start and end of the summit:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Cut out columns
> 1. **Cut** {% icon tool %}: Run **Cut columns from a table** with the following settings:
>   - *"Cut columns"*: `c1,c8,c9`
>   - *"Delimited by Tab"*: `Tab`
>   - *"From"*: our latest history item
>
>    The output from **Cut** will be in `tabular` format.
>
> 2. Change the format to `interval` since that's what the tool **Intersect** expects.
{: .hands_on}

## Get gene names

The RefSeq genes we downloaded from UCSC did only contain the RefSeq identifiers, but not the gene names. To get a list of gene names in the end, we use another BED file from the Data Libraries.

> ### {% icon comment %} Comments
> There are several ways to get the gene names in, if you need to do it yourself. One way is to retrieve a mapping through Biomart and then join the two files (**Join two Datasets side by side on a specified field** {% icon tool %}). Another is to get the full RefSeq table from UCSC and manually convert it to BED format.

{: .hands_on}

We used our workflow to rerun our analysis with the peak summits. The **Group** tool again produced a list containing the amount of genes found in each chromosome.
But woudln't it be more interesting to know about the amount of peaks in each unique gene? Let's rerun the workflow with different settings!

# Share your work

One of the most important features of Galaxy comes at the end of an analysis. When you have published striking findings, it is important that other researchers are able to reproduce your in-silico experiment. Galaxy enables users to easily share their workflows and histories with others.

To share a history, click on the {% icon galaxy-gear %} (gear) symbol in the history pane and select `Share or Publish`. On this page you can do 3 things:

1. **Make accessible via Link**

    This generates a link that you can give out to others. Anybody with this link will be able to view your history.

2. **Publish History**

    This will not only create a link, but will also publish your history. This means your history will be listed under `Shared Data â†’ Published Histories` in the top menu.

3. **Share with Individual Users**

    This will share the history only with specific users on the Galaxy instance.


> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Share history and workflow
>
> 1. Share one of your histories with your neighbour
> 2. See if you can do the same with your workflow!
> 3. Find the history and/or workflow shared by your neighbour
>
>    Histories shared with specific users can be accessed by those users in their history menu ({% icon galaxy-gear %} (gear) icon) under `Histories shared with me`.
