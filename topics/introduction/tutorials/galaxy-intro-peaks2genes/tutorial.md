# Introduction


We stumbled upon a paper ({% cite Li2012 %}) called *"The histone acetyltransferase MOF is a key regulator of the embryonic stem cell core transcriptional network"*. The paper contains the analysis of possible target genes of an interesting protein called Mof. The targets were obtained by ChIP-seq in mice and the raw data is available through [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE37268).
However, the list of genes is neither in the supplement of the paper, nor part of the GEO submission.
The closest thing we could find is a file in GEO containing a list of the regions where the signal is significantly enriched (so called *peaks*):

1 | 3660676 | 3661050 | 375 | 210 | 62.0876250438913 | -2.00329386666667

**Table 1** Subsample of the available file

The goal of this exercise is to **turn this list of genomic regions into a list of possible target genes**.

Now we have collected all the data we need to start our analysis.

# Part 1: Naive approach

We will first use a "naive" approach to try to identify the genes that the peak regions are associated with. We will identify genes that overlap at least 1bp with the peak regions.

## File preparation

Let's have a look at our files to see what we actually have here.

In order to compare the two files, we have to make sure that the chromosome names follow the same format.
As we can see, the peak file lacks `chr` before any chromosome number. But what happens with chromosome 20 and 21? Will it be X and Y instead? Let's check:

{: .hands_on}

In order to convert the chromosome names we have therefore two things to do:

1. add `chr`
2. change 20 and 21 to X and Y

## Analysis

Our goal is to compare the 2 region files (the genes file and the peak file from the publication)
to know which peaks are related to which genes. If you only want to know which peaks are located **inside** genes (within the gene body) you
can skip the next step. Otherwise, it might be reasonable to include the **promoter** region of the genes into the comparison, e.g. because
you want to include transcriptions factors in ChIP-seq experiments. There is no strict definition for promoter region but 2kb upstream of the TSS (start of region) is commonly used. We'll use the **Get Flanks** tool to get regions 2kb bases upstream of the start of the gene to 10kb bases downstream of the start (12kb in length). To do this we tell the Get Flanks tool we want regions upstream of the start, with an offset of 10kb, that are 12kb in length, as shown in the diagram below.

![Get Flanks](../../images/intro_get_flanks.png)

>     - *"Region"*: `Around Start`
>     - *"Location of the flanking region/s"*: `Upstream`
>     - *"Offset"*: `10000`
>     - *"Length of the flanking region(s)"*: `12000`
>
>     This tool returns flanking regions for every gene

> 3. Rename your dataset to reflect your findings (`Promoter regions`)
{: .hands_on}

The output is regions that start from 2kb upstream of the TSS and include 10kb downstream. For input regions on the positive strand e.g. `chr1 134212701 134230065` this gives `chr1 134210701 134222701`. For regions on the negative strand e.g. `chr1 8349819 9289958` this gives `chr1  9279958 9291958`.

You might have noticed that the UCSC file is in `BED` format and has a database associated to it. That's what we want for our peak file as well. The **Intersect** tool we will use can automatically convert interval files to BED format but we'll convert our interval file explicitly here to show how this can be achieved with Galaxy.

{: .hands_on}

It's time to find the overlapping intervals (finally!). To do that, we want to extract the genes which overlap/intersect with our peaks.

> <hands-on-title>Find Overlaps</hands-on-title>

>     - *"of"*: the UCSC file with promoter regions (`Promoter regions`)
>     - *"that intersect"*: our peak region file from **Replace** (`Peak regions BED`)
>     - *"for at least"*: `1`
>
>    > <comment-title></comment-title>
>    > The order of the inputs is important! We want to end up with a list of **genes**, so the corresponding dataset with the gene information needs to be the first input (`Promoter regions`).

>    ![Genes overlapping peaks](../../images/intro_overlapping_genes.png)
{: .hands_on}

We now have the list of genes (column 4) overlapping with the peak regions, similar to shown above.

To get a better overview of the genes we obtained, we want to look at their distribution across the different chromosomes.
We will group the table by chromosome and count the number of genes with peaks on each chromosome

If you followed step by step, with the same annotation, it should be chromosome 11 with 1992 genes. Note that for reproducibility, you should keep all input data used within the analysis. Rerunning the analysis with the same set of parameters, stored Galaxy, can lead to a different result if the inputs changed e.g. the annotation from UCSC.

## Visualization

We have some nice aggregated data, so why not draw a barchart of it?

Before we do that we should polish our grouped data a bit more though.

You may have noticed that the mouse chromosomes are not listed in their correct
order in that dataset (the **Group** tool tried to sort them, but did so
alphabetically).

We can fix this by running a dedicated tool for sorting on our data.

## Extracting workflow

When you look carefully at your history, you can see that it contains all the steps of our analysis, from the beginning to the end. By building this history we have actually built a complete record of our analysis with Galaxy preserving all parameter settings applied at every step.
Wouldn't it be nice to just convert this history into a workflow that we'll be able to execute again and again?

Galaxy makes this very simple with the `Extract workflow` option. This means that any time you want to build a workflow, you can just perform it manually once, and then convert it to a workflow, so that next time it will be a lot less work to do the same analysis. It also allows you to easily share or publish your analysis.

By default all the outputs of a workflow will be shown, but we can explicitly tell Galaxy which output to show and which to hide for a given workflow. This behaviour is controlled by the little asterisk next to every output dataset:

Now it's time to reuse our workflow for a more sophisticated approach.

# Part 2: More sophisticated approach

In part 1 we used an overlap definition of 1 bp (default setting) to identify genes associated with the peak regions. However, the peaks could be broad, so instead, in order to get a more meaningful definition, we could identify the genes that overlap where most of the reads are concentrated, the **peak summit**. We will use the information on the position of the peak summit contained in the original peak file and check for overlap of the summits with genes.

## Preparation

We again need our peak file, but we'd like to work in a clean history. Instead of uploading it twice, we can copy it to a new history.

> <hands-on-title>Copy history items</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Create a new history and give it a new name like `Galaxy Introduction Part 2`
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/histories_create_new.md %}
>
> 2. Click on the **View all histories** ({% icon galaxy-columns %} icon) at the top right of your history
>
>       You should see both of your histories side-by-side now
>
> 3. Drag and drop the edited peak file (`Peak regions`, after the replace steps), which contains the summit information, to your new history.
> 4. Click on the Home icon {% icon galaxy-home %} (or **Analyze Data** on older Galaxy versions) in the top menu bar to go back to your analysis window
>
{: .hands_on}

## Create peak summit file

We need to generate a new BED file from the original peak file that contains the positions of the peak summits. The start of the summit is the start of the peak (column 2) plus the location within the peak that has the highest hypothetical DNA fragment coverage (column 5, rounded down to the next smallest integer because some peak summits fall in between to bases). As the end of the peak region, we will simply define `start + 1`.

> <hands-on-title>Create peak summit file</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [Compute on rows](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/column_maker/Add_a_column1/2.0) %} with the following parameters:
>   - *"Input file"*: our peak file `Peak regions` (the interval format file)
>   - *"Input has a header line with column names?": `No`
>   - In *"Expressions"*:
>       - {% icon param-repeat %} *"Expressions"*
>           - *"Add expression"*: `c2 + int(c5)`
>           - *"Mode of the operation"*: Append
>       - {% icon param-repeat %} *"Expressions"*
>           - *"Add expression"*: `c8 + 1`
>           - *"Mode of the operation"*: Append
>
>   This will create an 8th and a 9th column in our table, which we will use in our next step:
>
> 2. Rename the output `Peak summit regions`
>
{: .hands_on}

Now we cut out just the chromosome plus the start and end of the summit:

> <hands-on-title>Cut out columns</hands-on-title>
> 1. {% tool [Cut](Cut1) %} columns from a table with the following settings:
>   - *"Cut columns"*: `c1,c8,c9`
>   - *"Delimited by Tab"*: `Tab`
>   - *"From"*: `Peak summit regions`
>
>    The output from **Cut** will be in `tabular` format.
>
> 2. Change the format to `interval` (use the {% icon galaxy-pencil %}) since that's what the tool **Intersect** expects.
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/datasets_change_datatype.md datatype="interval" %}
>
>    The output should look like below:
>
>    ![Peak summits](../../images/intro_summits.png){: width="200px"}

## Get gene names

The RefSeq genes we downloaded from UCSC did only contain the RefSeq identifiers, but not the gene names. To get a list of gene names in the end, we use another BED file from the Data Libraries.

> <comment-title></comment-title>
> There are several ways to get the gene names in, if you need to do it yourself. One way is to retrieve a mapping through Biomart and then join the two files (**Join two Datasets side by side on a specified field** {% icon tool %}). Another is to get the full RefSeq table from UCSC and manually convert it to BED format.

## Repeat workflow

It's time to reuse the workflow we created earlier.

> <hands-on-title>Run a workflow</hands-on-title>
> 1. Open the workflow menu (top menu bar)
> 2. Find the workflow you made in the previous section, and select the option **Run**
> 3. Choose as inputs our `mm9.RefSeq_genes` (`#genes`) BED file and the result of the **Cut** tool (`#peaks`)
> 4. Click **Run workflow**
>
>    The outputs should appear in the history but it might take some time until they are finished.
>
{: .hands_on}

We used our workflow to rerun our analysis with the peak summits. The **Group** tool again produced a list containing the number of genes found in each chromosome.
But wouldn't it be more interesting to know the number of peaks in each unique gene? Let's rerun the workflow with different settings!

> <hands-on-title>Run a workflow with changed settings</hands-on-title>
> 1. Open the workflow menu (top menu bar)
> 2. Find the workflow you made in the previous section, and select the option **Run**
> 3. Choose as inputs our `mm9.RefSeq_genes` (`#genes`) BED file and the result of the **Cut** tool (`#peaks`)
> 4. Click on the title of the {% icon tool %} **Group** tool to expand the options.
> 5. Change the following settings by clicking on the {% icon galaxy-pencil %} (pencil) icon on the left:
>     - *"Group by column"*: `7`
>     - In *"Operation"*:
>       - *"On column"*: `7`
> 6. Click **Run workflow**
{: .hands_on}

Congratulations! You should have a file with all the unique gene names and a count on how many peaks they contained.

> <question-title></question-title>
>
> The list of unique genes is not sorted. Try to sort it on your own!

# Share your work

One of the most important features of Galaxy comes at the end of an analysis. When you have published striking findings, it is important that other researchers are able to reproduce your in-silico experiment. Galaxy enables users to easily share their workflows and histories with others.

To share a history, click on the {% icon galaxy-gear %} (gear) symbol in the history pane and select `Share or Publish`. On this page you can do 3 things:


1. **Make accessible via Link**

    This generates a link that you can give out to others. Anybody with this link will be able to view your history.

2. **Publish History**

    This will not only create a link, but will also publish your history. This means your history will be listed under `Shared Data â†’ Published Histories` in the top menu.

3. **Share with Individual Users**

    This will share the history only with specific users on the Galaxy instance.

![The menu for sharing histories includes buttons for making the history accessible, publishing it on this Galaxy server, and displays a sharable link to the history. At the bottom is a button for sharing the history with individual users.](../../images/publish.PNG)

> <hands-on-title>Share history and workflow</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Share one of your histories with your neighbour
> 2. See if you can do the same with your workflow!
> 3. Find the history and/or workflow shared by your neighbour
>
>    Histories shared with specific users can be accessed by those users in their history menu ({% icon galaxy-gear %} (gear) icon) under `Histories shared with me`.
