                <p>We stumbled upon a paper (<span class="citation"><a href="#Li2012">Li <i>et al.</i> 2012</a></span>) called <em>“The histone acetyltransferase MOF is a key regulator of the embryonic stem cell core transcriptional network”</em>. The paper contains the analysis of possible target genes of an interesting protein called Mof. The targets were obtained by ChIP-seq in mice and the raw data is available through <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE37268">GEO</a>.
However, the list of genes is neither in the supplement of the paper, nor part of the GEO submission.
The closest thing we could find is a file in GEO containing a list of the regions where the signal is significantly enriched (so called <em>peaks</em>):</p>

  <p><strong>Interval</strong> format is a Galaxy format for representing genomic intervals. It is tab-separated, but has the added requirement that three of the columns must be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>chromosome ID</li>
    <li>start position (0-based)</li>
    <li>end position (end-exclusive)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>An optional strand column can also be specified, and an initial header row can be used to label the columns, which do not have to be in any special order. Unlike BED format (see below) arbitrary additional columns can also be present.</p>

  <p>You can find more information about formats that can be used in Galaxy at the <a href="https://usegalaxy.org/static/formatHelp.html">Galaxy Data Formats page</a>.</p>

The unique feature of these tags is that they <em>propagate</em>: if a dataset is labelled with a name tag, all derivatives (children) of this dataset will automatically inherit this tag (see below). The figure below explains why this is so useful. Consider the following analysis (numbers in parenthesis correspond to dataset numbers in the figure below):</p>   <ol>   <li>a set of forward and reverse reads (datasets 1 and 2) is mapped against a reference using <span><strong>Bowtie2</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> generating dataset 3;</li>   <li>dataset 3 is used to calculate read coverage using <span><strong>BedTools Genome Coverage</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> <em>separately</em> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> strands.

This is shown on the left side of the figure. It is hard to trace which datasets contain “plus” data versus “minus” data. For example, does dataset 10 contain “plus” data or “minus” data? Probably “minus” but are you sure? In the case of a small history like the one shown here, it is possible to trace this manually but as the size of a history grows it will become very challenging.</p>   <p>The right side of the figure shows exactly the same analysis, but using name tags. When the analysis was conducted datasets 4 and 5 were tagged with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#plus</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#minus</code>, respectively. When they were used as inputs to Macs2 resulting datasets 6 and 8 automatically inherited them and so on… As a result it is straightforward to trace both branches (plus and minus) of this analysis.</p>   <p>More information is in a <a href="/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/name-tags/tutorial.html">dedicated #nametag tutorial</a>.</p>   <!-- Image is here = https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1iiNsau6ddiE2MV9qMyekUq2mrpDHHcc02bXtcFEAnhY/edit?usp=sharing --> </blockquote>

    <p>This peak file is not in any standard format and just by looking at it, we cannot find out what the numbers in the different columns mean. In the paper the authors mention that they used the peak caller <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20598134">HPeak</a>.</p>

    <p>By looking at the HPeak manual we can find out that the columns contain the following information:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>chromosome name by number</li>
      <li>start coordinate</li>
      <li>end coordinate</li>

<p>In order to compare the two files, we have to make sure that the chromosome names follow the same format.
As we can see, the peak file lacks <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chr</code> before any chromosome number. But what happens with chromosome 20 and 21? Will it be X and Y instead? Let’s check:</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>

<p>Our goal is to compare the 2 region files (the genes file and the peak file from the publication)
to know which peaks are related to which genes. If you only want to know which peaks are located <strong>inside</strong> genes (within the gene body) you
can skip the next step. Otherwise, it might be reasonable to include the <strong>promoter</strong> region of the genes into the comparison, e.g. because
you want to include transcriptions factors in ChIP-seq experiments. There is no strict definition for promoter region but 2kb upstream of the TSS (start of region) is commonly used. We’ll use the <strong>Get Flanks</strong> tool to get regions 2kb bases upstream of the start of the gene to 10kb bases downstream of the start (12kb in length). To do this we tell the Get Flanks tool we want regions upstream of the start, with an offset of 10kb, that are 12kb in length, as shown in the diagram below.</p>

<p>We now have the list of genes (column 4) overlapping with the peak regions, similar to shown above.</p>

<h2 id="extracting-workflow">Extracting workflow</h2>

<p>When you look carefully at your history, you can see that it contains all the steps of our analysis, from the beginning to the end. By building this history we have actually built a complete record of our analysis with Galaxy preserving all parameter settings applied at every step.
Wouldn’t it be nice to just convert this history into a workflow that we’ll be able to execute again and again?</p>

<p>Galaxy makes this very simple with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Extract workflow</code> option. This means that any time you want to build a workflow, you can just perform it manually once, and then convert it to a workflow, so that next time it will be a lot less work to do the same analysis. It also allows you to easily share or publish your analysis.</p>

    <p>When a workflow is executed, the user is usually primarily interested in the final product and not in all intermediate steps.

    <p>If you click on this asterisk for any of the output datasets, then <em>only</em> files with an asterisk will be shown, and all outputs without an asterisk will be hidden (Note that clicking <em>all</em> outputs has the same effect as clicking <em>none</em> of the outputs, in both cases all the datasets will be shown).</p>

<p>Now it’s time to reuse our workflow for a more sophisticated approach.</p>

<h1 id="part-2-more-sophisticated-approach">Part 2: More sophisticated approach</h1>

<p>In part 1 we used an overlap definition of 1 bp (default setting) to identify genes associated with the peak regions. However, the peaks could be broad, so instead, in order to get a more meaningful definition, we could identify the genes that overlap where most of the reads are concentrated, the <strong>peak summit</strong>. We will use the information on the position of the peak summit contained in the original peak file and check for overlap of the summits with genes.</p>

<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>

<p>We again need our peak file, but we’d like to work in a clean history. Instead of uploading it twice, we can copy it to a new history.</p>

<h2 id="get-gene-names">Get gene names</h2>

<p>The RefSeq genes we downloaded from UCSC did only contain the RefSeq identifiers, but not the gene names. To get a list of gene names in the end, we use another BED file from the Data Libraries.</p>

<blockquote class="comment">
  <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-1"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment</div>
  <p>There are several ways to get the gene names in, if you need to do it yourself. One way is to retrieve a mapping through Biomart and then join the two files (<strong>Join two Datasets side by side on a specified field</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">tool</span>). Another is to get the full RefSeq table from UCSC and manually convert it to BED format.</p>

<p>We used our workflow to rerun our analysis with the peak summits. The <strong>Group</strong> tool again produced a list containing the number of genes found in each chromosome.
But wouldn’t it be more interesting to know the number of peaks in each unique gene? Let’s rerun the workflow with different settings!</p>

<h1 id="share-your-work">Share your work</h1>

<p>One of the most important features of Galaxy comes at the end of an analysis. When you have published striking findings, it is important that other researchers are able to reproduce your in-silico experiment. Galaxy enables users to easily share their workflows and histories with others.</p>

<p>To share a history, click on the <i class="fas fa-bars" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">galaxy-history-options</span> history options and select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Share or Publish</code>. On this page you can do 3 things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make accessible via Link</strong></p>

    <p>This generates a link that you can give out to others. Anybody with this link will be able to view your history.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make History publicly available in Published Histories</strong></p>

    <p>This will not only create a link, but will also publish your history. This means your history will be listed under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Data → Histories → Published Histories</code> in the top menu.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Share with Individual Users</strong></p>

    <p>This will share the history only with specific users on the Galaxy instance.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><a href="../../images/publish.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/publish.png" alt="The menu for sharing histories includes buttons for making the history accessible, publishing it on this Galaxy server, and displays a sharable link to the history. At the bottom is a button for sharing the history with individual users." width="585" height="397" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p><i class="fas fa-trophy" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">trophy</span> You have just performed your first analysis in Galaxy. You also created a workflow from your analysis so you can easily repeat the exact same analysis on other datasets. Additionally you shared your results and methods with others.</p>

However what I am getting is similar to the results of the + strand; the promoter regions lies between 8347819 and 8359819; it seems to me that get flanks did not recognize between the + and - strands

					<b>Liked</b>: the concept.
					<b>Disliked</b>: multiple issues with platform - loosing (they are not on the screen) history buttons, tag buttons, Once I brought the UCSC file in, I no longer can find the gz file - maybe it is supposed to be merged, but that is not what the tutorial showed.  There was a disclaimer that said 'results might be different' but there were no Chr 21 to rename on the file.  A little video showing what to expect might be more helpful than the icons in the description.  I see it was updated in early November, but as a real beginner,  this isn't any fun at all and very frustrating.
