# Using the Integrative Genomics Viewer

**Bioinformatics Galaxy Course**

**MPI-IE & University of Freiburg**

To start IGV, go to the IGV downloads page: https://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download.

## User Interface

## Main Window

![MainWindowIGV](https://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/sites/cancerinformatics.org.igv/files/images/igv_desktop_callouts.jpg)


**Tool bar** ![callout_1.jpg](../../images/callout_1.jpg)

- The [tool bar](https://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/?q=ToolBar) provides access to commonly used functions. The [menu bar](https://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/?q=MenuBar) and [pop-up menus](http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/?q=PopupMenus) (not shown) provide access to all other functions.

**Chromosome** ![callout_2.jpg](../../images/callout_2.jpg)

- The red box on the chromosome ideogram indicates which portion of the chromosome is displayed. When zoomed out to display the full chromosome, the red box disappears from the ideogram.

**Ruler** ![callout_3.jpg](../../images/callout_3.jpg)

- The ruler reflects the visible portion of the chromosome. The tick marks indicate chromosome locations. The span lists the number of bases currently displayed.

**Tracks** ![callout_4.jpg](../../images/callout_4.jpg)

- IGV displays data in horizontal rows called tracks. Typically, each track represents one sample or experiment. This example shows methylation, gene expression, copy number and mutation data.

**Features** ![callout_5.jpg](../../images/callout_5.jpg)

- IGV also displays features, such as genes, in tracks. By default, IGV displays data in one panel and features in another, as shown here. Drag-and-drop a track name to move a track from one panel to another. Combine data and feature panels by selecting that option on the General tab of the [Preferences window](https://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/?q=Preferences).

**Track names** ![callout_6.jpg](../../images/callout_6.jpg)

- Track names are listed in the far left panel. Legibility of the names depends on the height of the tracks; i.e., the smaller the track the less legible the name.

**Attributes** ![callout_7.jpg](../../images/callout_7.jpg)

- Attribute names are listed at the top of the attribute panel. Colored blocks represent attribute values, where each unique value is assigned a unique color. Hover over a colored block to see the attribute value. Click an attribute name to sort tracks based on that attribute value.


## Menu Bar

**Tools**

- Run igvtools - Launches the igvtools interface window.

- Find Motif - Search for a particular nucleotide sequence in the reference genome.

- Gitools Heatmaps - Data and results are represented as browsable heatmaps. Data can be exported from IGV in gitools format, or loaded directly into a running gitools session. See http://www.gitools.org for details.

- BEDTools - A fast, flexible suite of tools used to compare sets of genomic features. IGV uses BEDTools to compare features in loaded tracks, and view the results as a new track. See more details under [Third Party Tools Integration](https://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/third_party_tools#_blank).

## Tool Bar


**Genome drop-down box** ![icon_genome_dropdown](../../images/icon_genome_dropdown.jpg)

- Loads a genome.

**Chromosome drop-down box** ![igv_chromdrop](../../images/igv_chromdrop.jpg)

- Zooms to a chromosome.

**Search box** ![searchbox](../../images/searchbox.jpg)

- Displays the chromosome location being shown.
To scroll to a different location, enter the gene name, locus, or track name and click Go.

**Whole genome view** ![icon_genome](../../images/icon_genome.jpg)

- Zooms to whole genome view.

![icon_backforward](../../images/icon_backforward.jpg)

- Moves backward and forward through views of the genome like the back and forward buttons in a web browser.

**Refresh** ![icon_refresh](../../images/icon_refresh.jpg)

- Refreshes the display.

**Define a region** ![icon_region_of_interest](../../images/icon_region_of_interest.jpg)

- Defines a region of interest on the chromosome.

![icon_squish](../../images/icon_squish.jpg)

- Reduces the row height on all tracks to fit all data for the region in view into the window; will also expand tracks (to their maximum preferred size) to fill the view, if needed.

![icon_popuponoff](../../images/icon_popuponoff.jpg)

- Toggles the pop-up information windows in IGV on or off.

**Zoom slider** ![icon_zoom](../../images/icon_zoom.jpg)

- Zooms in and out on a chromosome.

## Pop-up Menus

To select tracks and display the pop-up menu, do one of the following:

- Right-click a track to select it and display the pop-up menu.

- Right-click an attribute value to select all tracks with that attribute value and display the pop-up menu. Tip: Keep in mind that right-clicking an attribute may select tracks that are not visible in the data panel. Scroll down the data panel to view all the selected tracks.

- Control-click track names (Mac: Command-click) to select the tracks, then right-click one of the selections to display the pop-up menu.

Commands in the track pop-up menu change the display options for the selected tracks. Most changes made via the pop-up menu are lost when you exit IGV unless you [save the session](https://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/Sessions). In a few cases, changing the pop-up menu also changes an option in the Preferences window; these changes are persistent.

## Using IGV: Examples

### LOOKING AT ENCODE RNA-SEQ DATA


- Open IGV (.igv.sh from command line)

- Load the human genome :  In the toolbar, Click Genome > Load Genome from Server > Search and select Human (hg19)

- Load the encode RNA-Seq BAM files: Go to File > Load from ENCODE > Select C2C12 RNA-Seq BAM files (See image in the Pdf)

![load_encode_RNA-seq_BAM](../../images/load_encode_RNA-seq_BAM.png)


- Go to your favorite location in the genome by entering the location in the Search box, zoom in to the reads by using Zoom button.

- You can change the track properties by right-click on the track. Select View as pairs to see the left and right pairs of paired-end reads.

![view_pairs](../../images/view_pairs.png)

- You can make a sashimi plot to see reads aligning to each junction. Right-click > Sashimi plot.
