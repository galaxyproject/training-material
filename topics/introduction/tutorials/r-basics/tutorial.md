# Creating objects in R

> ### {% icon comment %} Reminder

{: .comment}

What might be called a variable in many languages is called an **object** in R.

To create an object you need:

- a name (e.g. `a`)
- a value (e.g. `1`)
- the assignment operator (`<-`)

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Create a first object

{: .hands_on}

The **Console** displays the lines of code run from the script and any outputs or status/warning/error messages (usually in red).

In the **Environment**, we have now a table:

Values | |
--- | ---
 a | 1

This **Environment** window allows you to keep track of the objects you have created in R.

#  Naming objects in R

Here are some important details about naming objects in R.

- **Avoid spaces and special characters**

    Object names cannot contain spaces or the minus sign (`-`). You can use `_` to make names more readable. You should avoid using special characters in your object name (e.g. `!`, `@`, `#`, `.` , etc.). Also, object names cannot begin with a number.

- **Use short, easy-to-understand names**

    You should avoid naming your objects using single letters (e.g. `n`, `p`, etc.). This is mostly to encourage you to use names that would make sense to anyone reading your code (a colleague, or even yourself a year from now). Also, avoiding excessively long names will make your code more readable.

- **Avoid commonly used names**

    There are several names that may already have a definition in the R language (e.g. `mean`, `min`, `max`). One clue that a name already has meaning is that if you start typing a name in RStudio and it gets a colored highlight or RStudio gives you a suggested autocompletion you have chosen a name that has a reserved meaning.

- **Use the recommended assignment operator**

    In R, we use `<-` as the preferred assignment operator. `=` works too, but is most commonly used in passing arguments to functions (more on functions later). There is a shortcut for the R assignment operator:
    - Windows execution shortcut: <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd>
    - Mac execution shortcut: <kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd>

There are a few more suggestions about naming and style you may want to learn more about as you write more R code. There are several "style guides" that have advice, and one to start with is the [tidyverse R style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/index.html).

> ### {% icon comment %} Pay attention to warnings in the script console
>
> If you enter a line of code in your script that contains an error, RStudio may give you an error message and underline this mistake. Sometimes these messages are easy to understand, but often the messages may need some figuring out. Paying attention to these warnings will help you avoid mistakes.
>
> In the example below, the object name has a space, which is not allowed in R. The error message does not say this directly, but R is "not sure" about how to assign the name to `human_ chr_number` when the object name we want is `human_chr_number`.

# Reassigning object names or deleting objects

Once an object has a value, you can change that value by overwriting it. R will not give you a warning or error if you overwriting an object, which may or may not be a good thing depending on how you look at it.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Overwrite an object

>    ```
>
>    If you run a line of code that has only an object name, R will normally display the contents of that object.
{: .hands_on}

You can also remove an object from R's memory entirely

>    Error: object 'gene_name' not found

# Understanding object data types or modes

In R, **every object has two properties**:

- **Length**: how many distinct values are held in that object
- **Mode**: what is the classification (type) of that object.

    The **"mode" property** corresponds to the **type of data an object represents**. The most common modes you will encounter in R are:

    - **Numeric (num)**: numbers such floating point/decimals (1.0, 0.5, 3.14)

        > ### {% icon comment %} More specific types
        > There are also more specific numeric types (dbl - Double, int - Integer). These differences are not relevant for most beginners and pertain to how these values are stored in memory
        {: .comment}

    - **Character (chr)**: a sequence of letters/numbers in single `''` or double `" "` quotes
    - **Logical**: boolean values, `TRUE` or `FALSE`

    There are a few other modes (i.e. "complex", "raw" etc.) but these are the three we will work with in this lesson.

Data types are familiar in many programming languages, but also in natural language where we refer to them as the parts of speech, e.g. nouns, verbs, adverbs, etc. Once you know if a word - perhaps an unfamiliar one - is a noun, you can probably guess you can count it and make it plural if there is more than one (e.g. 1 [Tuatara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatara), or 2 Tuataras). If something is a adjective, you can usually change it into an adverb by adding "-ly" (e.g. [jejune](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jejune) vs. jejunely). Depending on the context, you may need to decide if a word is in one category or another (e.g "cut" may be a noun when it's on your finger, or a verb when you are preparing vegetables). These concepts have important analogies when working with R objects.

The created object seems to a character object.

# Mathematical and functional operations on objects

Once an object exists (which by definition also means it has a mode), R can appropriately manipulate that object. For example, objects of the numeric modes can be added, multiplied, divided, etc. R provides several mathematical (arithmetic) operators including:

- `+`: addition
- `-`: subtraction
- `*`: multiplication
- `/`: division
- `^` or `**`: exponentiation
- `a%%b`: modulus (the remainder after division)

# Vectors

Vectors are probably the most used commonly used object type in R. **A vector is a collection of values that are all of the same type (numbers, characters, etc.)**.

One of the most common ways to create a vector is to use the `c()` function - the "concatenate" or "combine" function. Inside the function you may enter one or more values, separated by a comma.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Create a vector
>
> 1. Create a `snp_genes` object containing "OXTR", "ACTN3", "AR", "OPRM1"
>
>    ```R

>    ```
>
> 2. Check how this object is stored in the **Environment** panel
{: .hands_on}

Vectors always have a **mode** and a **length**. In the **Environment** panel, we could already have an insight on these properties: `chr [1:4]` may indicate character and 4 values.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Check vector properties
>
> 1. Check the mode of `snp_genes` object
>
>    ```R
>    # Check the mode of 'snp_genes'
>    > mode(snp_genes)
>    [1] "character"
>    ```
>
> 2. Check the mode of `snp_genes` length
>
>    ```R
>    # Check the mode of 'snp_genes'
>    > length(snp_genes)
>    [1] "4"
>    ```
>
> 3. Check both properties using `str` function
>
>    ```R
>    # Check the structure of 'snp_genes'
>    > str(snp_genes)
>    [1] chr [1:4] "OXTR" "ACTN3" "AR" "OPRM1"
>    ```
{: .hands_on}

The `str()` (structure) function is giving the same information as the **Environmnent** panel.

Vectors are quite important in R. Another data type that we will not work in this tutorial but in extra tutorial: data frames, are collections of vectors. What we learn here about vectors will pay off even more when we start working with data frames.

## Creating and subsetting vectors

Once we have vectors, one thing we may want to do is specifically retrieve one or more values from our vector. To do so, we use **bracket notation**. We type the name of the vector followed by square brackets. In those square brackets we place the index (e.g. a number) in that bracket.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Get values from vectors
>
> 1. Create several vectors
>    - `snps` object with "rs53576", "rs1815739", "rs6152", "rs1799971"
>    - `snp_chromosomes` object with "3", "11", "X", "6"
>    - `snp_positions` object with 8762685, 66560624, 67545785, 154039662
>
>    ```R
>    # Some interesting human SNPs
>    # while accuracy is important, typos in the data won't hurt you here
>    snps <- c('rs53576', 'rs1815739', 'rs6152', 'rs1799971')
>    snp_chromosomes <- c('3', '11', 'X', '6')
>    snp_positions <- c(8762685, 66560624, 67545785, 154039662)
>    ```
>
> 2. Get the 3rd value in the `snp_genes` vector
>
>    ```R
>    # get the 3rd value in the snp_genes vector
>    > snp_genes[3]
>    [1] "AR"
>    ```
{: .hands_on}

In R, every item your vector is indexed, starting from the first item (1) through to the final number of items in your vector.

You can also retrieve a range of numbers:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Retrieve a range of values from vectors
> 1. Get the 1st through 3rd value in the `snp_genes` vector
>
>    ```R
>    # get the 1st through 3rd value in the snp_genes vector
>    > snp_genes[1:3]
>    [1] "OXTR"  "ACTN3" "AR"
>    ```
>
> 2. Get the 1st, 3rd, and 4th value in the `snp_genes` vector
>
>    ```R
>    # get the 1st, 3rd, and 4th value in the snp_genes vector
>    > snp_genes[c(1, 3, 4)]
>    [1] "OXTR"  "AR"    "OPRM1"
>    ```
{: .hands_on}

To retrieve several (but not necessarily sequential) items from a vector, you pass a **vector of indices**, a vector that has the numbered positions you wish to retrieve.

There are additional (and perhaps less commonly used) ways of subsetting a vector (see [these
examples](https://thomasleeper.com/Rcourse/Tutorials/vectorindexing.html)). Also, several of these subsetting expressions can be combined.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Retrieve a complex range of values from vectors
> 1. Get the 1st through the 3rd value, and 4th value in the `snp_genes` vector
>
>    ```R
>    # get the 1st through the 3rd value, and 4th value in the snp_genes vector
>    # yes, this is a little silly in a vector of only 4 values.
>    > snp_genes[c(1:3,4)]
>    [1] "OXTR"  "ACTN3" "AR"    "OPRM1"
>    ```
{: .hands_on}

## Adding to, removing, or replacing values in existing vectors

Once you have an existing vector, you may want to add a new item to it. To do so, you can use the `c()` function again to add your new value.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Add values to vectors
> 1. Add "CYP1A1", "APOA5" to `snp_genes` vector
>
>    ```R
>    # add the gene 'CYP1A1' and 'APOA5' to our list of snp genes
>    # this overwrites our existing vector
>    snp_genes <- c(snp_genes, "CYP1A1", "APOA5")
>    ```
>
> 2. Check the content of `snp_genes`
>
>    ```R
>    > snp_genes
>    [1] "OXTR"   "ACTN3"  "AR"     "OPRM1"  "CYP1A1" "APOA5"
>    ```
{: .hands_on}

To remove a value from a vection, we can use a negative index that will return a version a vector with that index's value removed.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Remove values to vectors
> 1. Check value corresponding to `-6` in `snp_genes`
>
>    ```R
>    > snp_genes[-6]
>    [1] "OXTR"   "ACTN3"  "AR"     "OPRM1"  "CYP1A1"
>    ```
>
> 2. Remove the 6th value of `snp_genes`
>
>    ```R
>    > snp_genes <- snp_genes[-6]
>    > snp_genes
>    [1] "OXTR"   "ACTN3"  "AR"     "OPRM1"  "CYP1A1"
>    ```
{: .hands_on}

We can also explicitly rename or add a value to our index using double bracket notation.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Rename values in vectors
> 1. Rename the 7th value to "APOA5"
>
>    ```R
>    > snp_genes[[7]]<- "APOA5"
>    > snp_genes
>    [1] "OXTR"   "ACTN3"  "AR"     "OPRM1"  "CYP1A1" NA       "APOA5"
>    ```
{: .hands_on}

Notice in the operation above that R inserts an `NA` value to extend our vector so that the gene "APOA5" is an index 7. This may be a good or not-so-good thing depending on how you use this.

> ### {% icon question %} Exercise: Examining and subsetting vectors

> > 6. True
> >
> {: .solution}
{: .question}

## Logical Subsetting

There is one last set of cool subsetting capabilities we want to introduce. It is possible within R to retrieve items in a vector based on a logical evaluation or numerical comparison.

For example, let's say we wanted get

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Subset logically vectors
> 1. Extract all of the SNPs in our vector of SNP positions (`snp_positions`) that were greater than 100,000,000
>
>    ```R
>    > snp_positions[snp_positions > 100000000]
>    [1] 154039662
>    ```
{: .hands_on}

In the square brackets you place the name of the vector followed by the comparison operator and (in this case) a numeric value. Some of the most common logical operators you will use in R are:

- `<`: less than
- `<=`: less than or equal to
- `>`: greater than
- `>=`: greater than or equal to
- `==`: exactly equal to
- `!=`: not equal to
- `!x`: not x
- `a | b`: a or b
- `a & b`: a and b

The reason why the expression `snp_positions[snp_positions > 100000000]` works can be better understood if you examine what the expression `snp_positions > 100000000` evaluates to:

```R
> snp_positions > 100000000
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE
```

The output above is a logical vector, the 4th element of which is `TRUE`. When you pass a logical vector as an index, R will return the true values:

```R
> snp_positions[c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)]
[1] 154039662
```

If you have never coded before, this type of situation starts to expose the "magic" of programming. We mentioned before that in the bracket notation you take your named vector followed by brackets which contain an index: `named_vector[index]`. The "magic" is that the index needs to *evaluate to* a number. So, even if it does not appear to be an integer (e.g. 1, 2, 3), as long as R can evaluate it, we will get a result. That our expression `snp_positions[snp_positions > 100000000]` evaluates to a number can be seen in the following situation.

How to know which **index** (1, 2, 3, or 4) in our vector of SNP positions was the one that was greater than 100,000,000?

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Getting which indices of any item that evaluates as TRUE
> 1. Return the indices in our vector of SNP positions (`snp_positions`) that were greater than 100,000,000
>
>    ```R
>    > which(snp_positions > 100000000)
>    [1] 4
>    ```
{: .hands_on}

**Why this is important?** Often in programming we will not know what inputs and values will be used when our code is executed. Rather than put in a pre-determined value (e.g 100000000) we can use an object that can take on whatever value we need.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Subset logically vectors
> 1. Create a `snp_marker_cutoff` containing `100000000`
> 1. Extract all of the SNPs in `snp_positions` that were greater than `snp_marker_cutoff`
>
> ```R

> > snp_positions[snp_positions > snp_marker_cutoff]
> [1] 154039662
> ```
>
{: .hands_on}

Ultimately, it's putting together flexible, reusable code like this that gets at the "magic" of programming!

## A few final vector tricks

Finally, there are a few other common retrieve or replace operations you may want to know about. First, you can check to see if any of the values of your vector are missing (i.e. are `NA`). Missing data will get a more detailed treatment later, but the `is.NA()` function will return a logical vector, with TRUE for any NA value:

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Check for missing values
> 1. Check what are the missing values in `snp_genes`
>

Sometimes, you may wish to find out if a specific value (or several values) is present a vector. You can do this using the comparison operator `%in%`, which will return TRUE for any value in your collection that is in the vector you are searching.

## Coercing values

Sometimes, it is possible that R will misinterpret the type of data represented in a vector, or store that data in a mode which prevents you from operating on the data the way you wish. For example, a long list of gene names isn't usually thought of as a categorical variable, the way that your experimental condition (e.g. control, treatment) might be. More importantly, some R packages you use to analyze your data may expect characters as input, not factors. At other times (such as plotting or some statistical analyses) a factor may be more appropriate. Ultimately, you should know how to change the mode of an object.

First, its very important to recognize that coercion happens in R all the time. This can be a good thing when R gets it right, or a bad thing when the result is not what you expect. Consider:

```R
> chromosomes <- c('3', '11', 'X', '6')
> mode(chromosomes)
[1] "character"
```

Although there are several numbers in our vector, they are all in quotes, so we have explicitly told R to consider them as characters. However, even if we removed the quotes from the numbers, R would coerce everything into a character:

```R
> chromosomes_2 <- c(3, 11, 'X', 6)
> typeof(chromosomes_2)
[1] "character"
> chromosomes_2[1]
[1] "3"
```

We can use the `as.` functions to explicitly coerce values from one form into another.

>    [1] 8762685
>    ```
{: .hands_on}

Here the coercion is straight forward, but what would happen if we tried using `as.numeric()` on `snp_chromosomes_2`

>

>    [1]  3 11 NA  6
>    ```
{: .hands_on}

We see that an `NA` value (R's default value for missing data) has been introduced.

Let's summarize this section on coercion with a few take home messages:

- Be careful to check the result when you explicitly coerce one data type into another (this is known as **explicit coercion**)

    Ideally, you should try to see if its possible to avoid steps in your analysis that force you to coerce.

- Check the structure (`str()`) of your data before working with them!

    R will sometimes coerce without you asking for it. This is called (appropriately) **implicit coercion**. For example when we tried to create a vector with multiple data types, R chose one type through implicit coercion.

# Lists

Lists are quite useful in R. You may come across lists in the way that some bioinformatics programs may store and/or return data to you. One of the key attributes of a list is that, unlike a vector, a list may contain data of more than one mode.
