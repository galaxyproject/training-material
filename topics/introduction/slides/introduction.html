# What is Galaxy?

---

[![Galaxy](../../../shared/images/galaxy_logo_25percent_transparent.png)](https://galaxyproject.org/)

- **Web-based** platform for computational biomedical research
  - Developed at Penn State, Johns Hopkins, OHSU and Cleveland Clinic with substantial outside contributions
  - **Open source** under [Academic Free License](https://opensource.org/licenses/AFL-3.0)
- More than 5,300 [citations](https://www.zotero.org/groups/1732893/galaxy)
- More than 80 [public Galaxy servers](https://galaxyproject.org/public-galaxy-servers/)
  - Many more non-public
  - Both general-purpose and domain-specific

???

- The Galaxy Team is composed by bioinformaticians and software engineers
- OHSU = Oregon Health & Science University

---

### Core values

- **Accessibility**
  - Users without programming experience can easily upload/retrieve data, run complex tools and workflows, and visualize data
- **Reproducibility**
  - Galaxy captures information so that any user can understand and repeat a complete computational analysis
- **Transparency**
  - Users can share or publish their analyses (histories, workflows, visualizations)
  - Pages: online Methods for your paper

Pages: interactive, web-based documents that describe a complete analysis.

???

**accessible** **reproducible** **transparent** research means <i>sharing everything</i>.

If the Galaxy framework makes everything as simple as possible, researchers are able to:
- share their analyses
- track all used tools and versions
- check all parameters
- justify each step in the analysis
- publish the findings with all aforementioned information

---

# User Interface

---

### Main Galaxy interface

![Galaxy user interface](../images/galaxy_interface.png)

Home page divided into 3 panels

---

### Top menu

![Top menu](../images/galaxy_interface_menu.png)

- *Analyze Data* - go back to the 3-panels homepage
- *Workflow* - access existing workflows or create new one using the editable diagrammatic pipeline
- *Shared data* - access data libraries, histories, workflows, visualizations and pages shared with you
- *Visualization* - create new track browser and access your saved visualisations
- *Help* - links to Galaxy Biostar (Q&A), Galaxy Community Hub (Wiki), and Interactive Tours
- *User* – your preferences and saved histories, datasets, and pages

---

### Tool interface

![Tool interface](../images/101_11.png)

---

### Tools

- Each tool is a text file describing:
  - input datasets, parameters, commands, and outputs
  - help, tests, citations, dependency requirements
- Free tool store: [Galaxy Tool Shed](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/)
  - Thousands of tools already available
  - Every software can be embedded
     - If a tool is not available, ask the Galaxy community for help!
  - Only a Galaxy admin can install tools
- New versions can be installed without removing old ones to ensure reproducibility

???

A tool describes:
- the input datasets and their datatypes
- the tool parameters (numerical, text, boolean, selections, colour)
- how to generate a command to execute the tool with the specified inputs and parameters
- the output datasets the tool should produce and their datatypes

Tools can be viewed as tiny LEGO pieces: each one solves a specific problem, and they can be combined together to build complex analysis pipelines.

---

### History

- Location of all your analyses <img style="float: right;" alt="History" src="../images/history.png" />
  - collects all datasets produced by tools you run
  - collects all operations performed on your data

- At the heart of Galaxy’s reproducibility<br />
  For each dataset, the history tracks:
  - name, format, size, creation time, datatype-specific metadata
  - tool id and version, inputs, parameters
  - standard output (`stdout`) and error (`stderr`)
  - state (<span style="background-color: grey">waiting</span>, <span style="background-color: yellow">running</span>, <span style="background-color: green">success</span>, <span style="background-color: red">failed</span>)
  - hidden, deleted, purged

???

We say <i>datasets</i> to refer to files as well as databases

Purged means permanently deleted
---

### Multiple histories

- You can have as many histories as you want

  - each history should correspond to a **different analysis**

  - and should have a meaningful **name**

---

### History options menu

- History behavior is controlled by the *History options* (gear icon) <img style="float: right;" alt="History menu" src="../images/galaxy_interface_history_long_menu.png" />

.image-25[![History options gear button](../images/galaxy_interface_history_menu.png)]

- *Create New* history will **not** make your current history disappear
- To list all your histories, choose *Saved Histories*
- You can *Copy Datasets* from one history to another
  - saves disk space and your quota

---

# Loading data

---

### Importing data

- Copy/paste from a file
- Upload data from a local computer
- Upload data from internet
- Upload data from online databases
  - UCSC, BioMart, ENCODE, modENCODE, Flymine etc.
- Import from Shared Data (libraries, histories, pages)
- Upload data from FTP (>2GB)

See [Getting data into Galaxy](../tutorials/galaxy-intro-get-data/slides.html)

---

### Datatypes

- When uploading, datatype can be automatically detected or assigned by user
- For datasets produced by a tool, the datatype is assigned by the tool
- Tools only accept input datasets with the appropriate datatypes
- You can change the datatype of a dataset in 2 ways:
  - Edit Attributes -> Datatype
  - Edit Attributes -> Convert Formats

???

- Edit Attributes -> Datatype is used to fix a wrongly assigned datatype
- Edit Attributes -> Convert Formats creates a new dataset using a tool that converts the original dataset in the new format
- New datatypes can be added to the Galaxy code base, if missing

---

### Reference genomes

- Genome build specifies which genome assembly a dataset is associated with
  - e.g. mm10, hg38...
- Genome build can be automatically detected or assigned by user
- User can define their own custom genome build
- New genome assemblies can be added by the site Galaxy admin

---

# Workflows

---

### Workflow interface

![Workflow interface](../images/RNA-Seq_workflow_editing.png)

???

- Boxes are workflow steps
  - 2 types: *input* and *tool* steps
- Steps are connected by arrows representing the flow of datasets
- Tool panel on the left with Inputs on top (to add input datasets and collections)
- Small tool form on the right

---

### Workflows

- Can be **extracted** from a history
  - Allow to easily convert an existing history into an analysis workflow
- Can be **built manually** by adding and configuring tools using the workflow canvas
- Can be **imported** using an existing shared workflow

---

### Why would you want to create workflows?

- **Re-run** the same analysis on different input data sets
- **Change parameters** before re-running a similar analysis
- Make use of the workflow job **scheduling**
  - jobs are submitted as soon as their inputs are ready
- Create **sub**-workflows: a workflow inside another workflow
- **Share** workflows for publication and with the community

---

### Data sharing

- You can share your Galaxy items - histories, workflows, visualizations, and pages - with other people in three different ways:
  - Directly using a Galaxy account's email addresses on the same instance
  - Using a web link, with anyone who knows the link
  - Using a web link and publishing it to make it accessible to everyone from the *Shared Data* menu


- Tools are shared using the free tool store: [Galaxy Tool Shed](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/)

---

### Data visualization

- Charts
- Each datatype can have some visualizations associated
- Track browser called Trackster
  - To visualize genomic data in a tightly integrated way

---

### Community

- Be part of an active and friendly community
- Get support and your questions answered on [Galaxy Biostars](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/)
- Access community curated documentation on [Galaxy Community Hub](https://www.galaxyproject.org/)
- Learn more about Galaxy for scientists and for developers and admins on [Galaxy Training Community]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}})
