## Workflows

The GalaxyP GTN project also offers a selection of published GalaxyP workflows. The presented workflows are adapted to specific
questions in proteomics,which are not answered in the more basic tutorials.
You are free to use and modify all workflows for your scientific question.

## Disclaimer
Thanks for your interest in the GTN GalaxyP training material project. We only recently started working on this
repository.We try to integrate more and more topics over time. Keep an eye out for new material from time to time.
