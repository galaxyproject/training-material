  "abstract": "Biological molecules such as proteins, peptides, DNA, and RNA can be represented by their biochemical or sequence-based properties. These properties can be utilized to deduce biological meanings using ML modeling. A descriptor or feature is the quantitative or qualitative measure of a property that is associated with a sequence. For example, a chemical compound can be described via its charge chemical formula, molecular weight, number of rotatable bonds, etc. Similarly, several properties can be deduced from the biological sequence that can be utilized to describe a biological activity such as anticancer property. Properties associated with a group of peptide sequences such as overall charge, hydrophobicity profile, or k-mer composition can be utilized to build an ML model and this model can be used to predict biological properties of unknown peptides. Several computational methods have been proven very useful in the initial screening and prediction of peptides for various biological properties. These methods have emerged as effective alternatives to the lengthy and expensive traditional experimental approaches. Finding ACPs through wet-lab methods is costly and time-consuming; thus, the development of an efficient computational approach is useful to predict potential ACP peptides before wet-lab experimentation. In this tutorial, we will be discussing how peptide-based properties like charge, hydrophobicity, the composition of amino acids, etc. can be utilized to predict the biological properties of peptides. Additionally, we will learn how to use different utilities of the Peptide Design and Analysis Under Galaxy (PDAUG) package to calculate various peptide-based descriptors and use these descriptors for ML modeling. We will use CTD (composition, transition, and distribution) descriptor to define peptide sequences in the training set and will test 6 different ML algorithms. We will also assess the effect of normalization on the accuracy of ML models."

                <p>Biological molecules such as proteins, peptides, DNA, and RNA can be represented by their biochemical or sequence-based properties. These properties can be utilized to deduce biological meanings using ML modeling. A descriptor or feature is the quantitative or qualitative measure of a property that is associated with a sequence. For example, a chemical compound can be described via its charge chemical formula, molecular weight, number of rotatable bonds, etc. Similarly, several properties can be deduced from the biological sequence that can be utilized to describe a biological activity such as anticancer property. Properties associated with a group of peptide sequences such as overall charge, hydrophobicity profile, or k-mer composition can be utilized to build an ML model and this model can be used to predict biological properties of unknown peptides. Several computational methods have been proven very useful in the initial screening and prediction of peptides for various biological properties. These methods have emerged as effective alternatives to the lengthy and expensive traditional experimental approaches. Finding ACPs through wet-lab methods is costly and time-consuming; thus, the development of an efficient computational approach is useful to predict potential ACP peptides before wet-lab experimentation. In this tutorial, we will be discussing how peptide-based properties like charge, hydrophobicity, the composition of amino acids, etc. can be utilized to predict the biological properties of peptides. Additionally, we will learn how to use different utilities of the Peptide Design and Analysis Under Galaxy (PDAUG) package to calculate various peptide-based descriptors and use these descriptors for ML modeling. We will use CTD (composition, transition, and distribution) descriptor to define peptide sequences in the training set and will test 6 different ML algorithms. We will also assess the effect of normalization on the accuracy of ML models.</p>

<h2 id="training-data-set">Training data set</h2>

<p>A high-quality dataset was retrieved from a previously published work <span class="citation"><a href="#hajisharifi_predicting_2014">Hajisharifi <i>et al.</i> 2014</a></span>.  In the, ML balance training set (an equal number of positive and negative samples) is always recommended. However, an imbalance training set can also be handled, and sometimes, to assess the robustness of the model an imbalanced training set is intentionally introduced.  The objective of this tutorial is to provide a basic introduction of ML in peptide research hence we will use a balanced training dataset with an equal number of positive (ACPs) and negative (non-ACPs) data.  A simple python code was applied to randomly select and removed several non-ACPs, which reduces their number from 205 to 138. The final training set contains 138 ACPs and 138 non-ACPs. The length distribution of the positive dataset is somewhat different from the negative dataset. Peptide length is an important feature in determining biological activity. Based on their length we assess the differences between ACPs and non-ACPs, and we found that except for a few outliers both ACPs and non-ACPs show a mean length of  40 and 32 respectively.</p>

<h2 id="calculating-peptide-descriptors">Calculating Peptide Descriptors</h2>

<p>In this step we will calculate CTD descriptos. Composition describptors are defined as the number of amino acids of a particular property divided by total number of amino acids.  Transition descriptors are representd as the number of transition from a particular property to different property divided by (total number of amino acids − 1). Distribution descriptors are derived by chain length and the amino acids of a particular property are located on this length <span class="citation"><a href="#Govindan_Nair_2013">Govindan and Nair 2013</a></span>.</p>

<h2 id="preparing-a-traning-data-set">Preparing a traning data set</h2>

<p>We will combine the ACPs and non-ACPs data set as a single tabular data and will add the class label.</p>

<h3 id="adding-class-labels-to-the-training-data">Adding class labels to the training data</h3>

<p>In Binary classification, ML algorithms classify the elements of a set into two groups based on a classification rule. Binary classes are usually represented by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>. In our example, we are finding peptides with anticancer properties, therefore we can denote all the peptides with anticancer properties as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> and peptides with non-anticancer properties as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>.  In general, samples represented with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> also describe as positive data, and samples with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> labels as negative data.  Data with multi-class classification problems can also be represented by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0, 1, 2, 3,</code> etc. In addition to this, in ML the class labels can also be represented by a string such as “anticancer” and “non-anticancer” or “treated” and “untreated”.  However, there are several ML tools and libraries prefer numerical class label over a string therefore, in this tutorial, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> will be used as class labels.</p>

<h2 id="applying-6-different-ml-algorithms-on-the-training-data-set">Applying 6 different ML algorithms on the training data set</h2>

<p>In this step, we will apply six ML algorithms Linear Regression Classifier (LRC), Random Forest Classifier(RFC), Gaussian naive Bayes Classifier (GBC), Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC) &amp; Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVMC) with 10 fold cross-validation on the training data. In cross-validation, positive and negative data are randomly divided into 10 parts each set has the 10th part of active as well as inactive peptides. The algorithm was trained on the 9 sets and the prediction was made on the remaining 10th set. This process was repeated for every set. Thus the final performance scores are calculated as a mean of all the folds. We used min-max to normalize the data before ML modeling. The entire workflow was applied to the four descriptor sets and accuracy was estimated based on accuracy, precision, recall, f1, and AUC.</p>

<p>The performance of ML algorithms can be assessed by commonly used performance measures represented in <strong>Figure 2</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Accuracy</strong> is described as correctly predicted instances and calculated based on true positive (TP) and true negative (TN) divided by TP, TN, false positive (FP), and false-negative (FN).</li>
  <li><strong>AUC</strong> is Area under ROC curve, where ROC is a receiver operating characteristic. AUC represents the area covered by ROC.</li>
  <li><strong>F1</strong> measures also an important estimate in model accuracy and can be defined as a harmonic mean of precision.</li>
  <li><strong>Precision</strong> also known as the probability of positive values (PPV), is summarised as the probability of currently predicted positive instances and estimated based on TP  and FP.</li>
  <li><strong>Recall</strong> also known as sensitivity, is defined as the estimation of the percentage of the correctly predicted positive instances and is also calculated with TP  and FP.</li>
</ul>

<p>The value for each of these estimates falls between 0 and 1, and larger values indicating a better performance and accuracy. The brighter yellow color shows high-performance while the blue color shows a lower score.  Heat map suggests that algorithms GBC, LRC, and SVMC show high performs in comparison to the other three. Better performance means these classifiers have been able to classify ACPs and non-ACPs more accurately than others. DTC shows an intermediate performance while RFC and SGDC performed poorly on this data set. Finally, we learn how to calculate features, how to utilize these features to build ML models, and how we can assess the performance of an ML model. In the future, advanced parameters of this algorithm can be assessed to improve the performance of the models. Additionally, several features can be calculated other than CTD and utilized to build ML models and assess performance.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In this tutorial, we learn how to utilize the quantitative properties of peptide sequences and apply the ML algorithms to predict the biological properties of the peptide sequence.</p>
