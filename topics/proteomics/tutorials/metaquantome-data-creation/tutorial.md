# Introduction


Metaproteomics {% cite Metaproteomics_video %} involves characterization of community level expression of microbial proteins from an environmental
or clinical sample. Metaproteomics data {% cite Metaproteomics_community_effort %} {% cite Jagtap2015 %} is primarily used to determine the functional status of the microbiome under study along with its taxonomic composition. The [Galaxy-P](http://galaxyp.org/) {% cite Galaxy-P_Metaproteomics %} team published a software suite named metaQuantome { % cite Easterly2019 %} to enable quantitative and statistical analysis and visualization of functional,
taxonomic expression as well as functional and taxonomy interaction. metaQuantome leverages peptide level quantitative information to analyze the taxonomic, functional expression within the microbial community in different conditions.

![Microbiome](../../images/microbiome.png){: width="75%"}

metaQuantome offers differential abundance analysis, principal components analysis, and clustered heat map visualizations,
across multiple experimental conditions. metaQuantome, an open source tool, is available via command line and also
accessible via Galaxy platform for reproducible analysis. As a first step for metaQuantome analysis, metaproteomics
data needs to be made compatible for subsequent analysis. With this in mind, we have developed a metaQuantome data
generation workflow tutorial that will help users generate inputs for metaQuantome analysis.

![Workflow](../../images/metaquantomeworkflow.png){: width="75%"}

To demonstrate the use of the data creation workflow, we have used a thermophilic biogas reactor dataset wherein municipal
food waste and manure is digested to generate methane gas. After one round in the reactor, the microbial community was
simplified and enriched via serial dilution. This inoculum was then transferred to a solution of cellulose from Norwegian
Spruce and incubated at 65Â°C. Triplicate samples were taken in a time series from 0 to 43 hours after inoculation and mass
spectrometry data was acquired on a Q-Exactive (Thermo) mass spectrometer. For this training, we have chosen two time points-8 hour and 33 hour.

# **Match peptide sequences**

For this, the sequence database-searching program called [SearchGUI](https://compomics.github.io/projects/searchgui.html) will be used.
The created dataset collection of the four *MZML files* in the history has to be first converted to MGF to be used as the MS/MS input.


### *Convert mzml to MGF with msconvert*

msconvert is used in order to convert the input file type, a mzml data collection, to a mgf file type.
The mgf file type can then be used as the Input Peak Lists when running SearchGUI.

##  *Search GUI*
SearchGUI is a tool that searches sequence databases on any number of MGF files. In this case, the previously made collection of three MGF files (entitles MGF files) will be used as the MS/MS input. This tool will produce an output file, called a SearchGUI archive file. This file will serve as in input for the next tool used, PeptideShaker.

When using large databases, the peptide identification step can take much more time for computation. In metaproteomics, choosing the optimal database is a crucial step of your workflow, for further reading see [Timmins-Schiffman et al (2017)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27824341).

##  *Peptide Shaker*

[PeptideShaker](https://compomics.github.io/projects/peptide-shaker.html) is a post-processing software tool that processes data from the SearchGUI software tool. PeptideShaker is a search engine for interpretation of proteomics identification results from multiple search engines, currently supporting X!Tandem, MS-GF+, MS Amanda, OMSSA, MyriMatch, Comet, Tide, Mascot, Andromeda and mzIdentML. More specifically, PeptideShaker processes data from  the SearchGUI tool through the organization of Peptide-Spectral Matches (PSMs) generated. In addition to organization, it provides an assessment of confidence of the data and generates outputs that can be visualized by users to interpret the results.

# **Peptide Quantification**

In this tutorial, we are using FlashLFQ as the quantitation tool. The user can choose to work with other quantitation tools, e.g. moFF and MaxQuant are available in Galaxy.

### *FlashLFQ*
[FlashLFQ](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/FlashLFQ) can quantify MS peaks in order to find the abundances of peptides. FlashLFQ is a fast label-free quantification algorithm. Additionally, the abundances of peptides within the sample can be compared between samples as further analysis beyond this workflow.

## *Unipept* for Functional annotation

Unipept is used to match tryptic peptides and find the taxonomy and Functional annotation of the peptides. Unipept is used to match sample tryptic peptides to proteins using a fast-matching algorithm. Although Unipept can be accessed and used through the web page, the use of Unipept on Galaxy allows the production of output datasets including the peptide information to be used in sequential steps. Unipept requires a list containing the peptide sequences which was generated by Query Tabular.

## *Extracting EC values*

> <hands-on-title>Extract EC numbers</hands-on-title>
> The cut tool cuts out specific columns from the dataset. In this case, the cut tool is being used to extract columns 1 (peptide) and 3 (EC number) from the dataset peptinfo EC.tsv output. This is a manipulation tool for metaQuantome's convenience.
>
> 1. {% tool [Cut](Cut1) %} with the following parameters:
>    - *"Cut columns"*: `c1,c3`
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"From"*: `output_ec_tsv` (output of **Unipept** {% icon tool %})
> 2. Rename EC_table.

## *Filtering confident peptides*

Query Tabular is a tool that can load tabular data into a SQLite database. This step precedes UniPept, as a list containing the peptide sequences must be generated. In this step a list of gene ontology (GO) terms is being generated.

> <hands-on-title>Filtering confident peptides</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [Query Tabular](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/query_tabular/query_tabular/3.0.0) %} with the following parameters:
>    - In *"Database Table"*:
>        - {% icon param-repeat %} *"Insert Database Table"*
>            - {% icon param-file %} *"Tabular Dataset for Table"*: `output_go_tsv` (output of **Unipept** {% icon tool %})
>            - In *"Table Options"*:
>                - *"Specify Name for Table"*: `Goterm`
>                - *"Specify Column Names (comma-separated list)"*: `peptide,total_protein_count,go_term,protein_count,go_name,go_funct`
>    - *"SQL Query to generate tabular output"*:
>      ```
>      SELECT Goterm.*
>      FROM Goterm
>      WHERE ((1.0*Goterm.protein_count)/(1.0*Goterm.total_protein_count)) >= 0.05
>      ```
>    - *"include query result column headers"*: `Yes`
>
> 2. Rename as Unipept_Function.

## *Removing Hashtag from output*

This step is to remove the hashtag from the Peptide header in the Unipept output.

> <hands-on-title>Remove # from peptide header</hands-on-title>
> 1. {% tool [Replace Text](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/text_processing/tp_replace_in_line/1.1.2) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"File to process"*: `Unipept_Function` (output of **Unipept** {% icon tool %})
>    - In *"Replacement"*:
>        - {% icon param-repeat %} *"Insert Replacement"*
>            - *"Find pattern"*: `#peptide`
>            - *"Replace with:"*: `peptide`
>
> 2. Rename file as All_functions

## *Filter* - EC values

We are using this Query tabular to rename the output that we obtained from the Cut column tool.

>        - {% icon param-repeat %} *"Insert Database Table"*
>            - {% icon param-file %} *"Tabular Dataset for Table"*: `EC_table` (output of **Cut** {% icon tool %})
>            - In *"Table Options"*:
>                - *"Specify Name for Table"*: `ec`
>                - *"Specify Column Names (comma-separated list)"*: `peptide,go_ec`
>    - *"SQL Query to generate tabular output"*:
>      ```sql
>      SELECT *
>      FROM ec
>      ```
>    - *"include query result column headers"*: `Yes`
>
> 2. Rename file as go_ec

## *Filter* - Biological Functions

The filter tool allows restriction of the dataset using simple conditional statements. This step is used to filter out the GO terms with biological processes and the corresponding number of peptides associated with these terms.


> <hands-on-title>Extracting biological processes for metaQuantome</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [Filter](Filter1) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Filter"*: `Unipept_Function` (output of **Query Tabular** {% icon tool %})
>    - *"With following condition"*: `c5=='biological process'`
>    - *"Number of header lines to skip"*: `1`
>
> 2. Rename file as `go_bp`

## *Filter* - Cellular components

This step is used to filter out the GO terms with cellular components and the corresponding number of peptides associated with these terms.

> <hands-on-title>Extracting cellular component for metaQuantome</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [Filter](Filter1) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Filter"*: `Unipept_Function` (output of **Query Tabular** {% icon tool %})
>    - *"With following condition"*: `c5=='cellular component'`
>    - *"Number of header lines to skip"*: `1`

# **Conclusion**


This completes the walkthrough of the metaQuantome data creation workflow. This tutorial is a guide to have datasets that are metaQuantome ready/compatible and can be used for metaproteomics research. We have incorporated only two conditions in this workflow but users can use as many as they want. Researchers can use this workflow with their data also, please note that the tool parameters and the workflow will be needed to be modified accordingly.

This workflow was developed by the Galaxy-P team at the University of Minnesota. For more information about Galaxy-P or our ongoing work, please visit us at [galaxyp.org](https://galaxyp.org)
