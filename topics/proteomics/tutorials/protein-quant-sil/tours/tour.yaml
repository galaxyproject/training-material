      To compare protein amounts in different samples from MS/MS data, two
      different experiment setups exist. Firstly, unmodified proteins can be
      measured in separate runs at one sample per MS-run. Secondly, proteins of
      samples to compare can be labelled with small chemical tags, mixed, and
      measured side-by-side in a single MS-run. There are two types of chemical
      tags:<ul>
        <li>Isobaric tags display the same mass on first hand, but fragment during the generation of the MS/MS spectra to yield reporter ions of different mass. The intensity of those reporter ions can be compared in MS/MS spectra. There are two types of isobaric tags commercially available: <i>tandem mass tags</i> (TMT) and <i>isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation</i> (iTRAQ).</li>
        <li>Isotopic tags are chemically identical, but differ in their mass due to incorporated stable isotopes. Examples of different isotopic tags for stable isotope labelling (SIL) are ICAT, SILAC, dimethylation, or heavy oxygen.</li></ul>

      This tutorial deals with protein quantitation via stable isotope labelling
      (SIL). For isotopic tags, quantitation can be achieved by comparing the
      intensity of MS1 peptide mass traces. The whole MS1 profile of a peptide,
      i.e. the intensities of all its isotopic peaks over time, is called a
      <i>peptide feature</i> (Figure 1a). Incorporation of stable isotopes
      results in different peptide masses on MS1 level, which give rise to
      coeluting ion traces in the TIC with a mass difference typical for each
      different chemical tag (Figure 1b). Figure originally published in <a
      href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25931027">Nilse et al, 2015</a>.

      <br><br>In this tutorial, we will use tools of the <a
      href="http://www.openms.org/">OpenMS suite<a/> to identify and quantify
      peptides and proteins.

      We will use a quantitative comparison of HEK cell lysate as a test
      dataset. In this experiment, HEK cells were once labelled with light, once
      with heavy SILAC. Both cultures were lysed simultaneously and the cell
      lysates were mixed in a certain ratio. A detailed description of the full
      dataset is available in the <a
      href="http://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/proteomics/tutorials/protein-quant-sil/tutorial.html">PRIDE
      archive</a>.

      Your objective in this hands-on-tutorial is to find out the correct mixing
      ratio of the test sample.<br>

      To speed up analysis, the input dataset was filtered to include only those
      data acquired in second 2000-3000 of the original LC gradient.

  - title: MS1 Feature Detection
    content: >-
      MS1 feature detection is a critical step in quantitative workflows. In
      principle, there are two different ways to define features:<ul>
        <li>Feature detection solely based upon MS1 data (mzML/raw files) without prior knowledge of peptide identifications (IDs).<ul>
          <li>Advantage: Feature results can be used to assist in peptide identification.</li>
          <li>Drawback: Not all peptide identifications can be mapped to features, thus not every identified peptide can be quantified.</li></ul></li>
        <li>Feature detection based upon peptide IDs.<ul>
          <li>Advantage: Most peptide IDs trigger a feature detection.</li>
          <li>Drawback: Feature results cannot be used to improve peptide ID.</li></ul></li>
      The OpenMS suite provides several tools (FeatureFinders) for MS1 feature
      detection. For SIL we have to use <b>FeatureFinderMultiplex</b>, which
      does not take peptide IDs as an input.

  - title: Mapping Identifications to Features
    content: >-
      We now have feature quantifications for MS1 elution peaks, peptide
      identifications for the MS2 spectra and protein identifications. The next
      step is to map the MS2-based peptide identifications to the quantified MS1
      precursor peaks (“peptide features”). This will enable the quantification
      of identified peptides. For labelled data, it is necessary to map peptide
      identifications to consensus features (i.e. a pair of one light peptide
      feature with one matching heavy feature in the correct m/z distance). For
      <bconsensusXML</b>, IDMapper uses the consensus centroids, not the feature
      boundaries for mapping. Therefore, the RT tolerance has to be set higher
      than for mapping to <b>featureXML</b>. A good starting value is half the
      expected typical retention time. <br><br>Sometimes several peptide
      identifications are mapped to a feature. The tool <a
      href="http://ftp.mi.fu-berlin.de/pub/OpenMS/release-documentation/html/TOPP_IDConflictResolver.html">IDConflictResolver</a>
      filters the mapping so that only the identification with the best score is
      associated to each feature. <br><br>Finally, we will combine the peptide
      quantifications to protein quantifications.

  - title: Evaluation and Optimization of Quantitation Results
    content: >-
      Protein quantitation is a multi-step procedure. Many parameters of
      different steps influence the final results. Therefore, it is recommended
      to optimize the tool parameters for each dataset and to carefully evaluate
      quantitation results. While the total number of quantified proteins is a
      first important parameter for optimization, it is also necessary to
      visualize the results and check for correct feature finding and ID
      mapping.<br><br> Galaxy does not provide a tool for proteomics
      visualization, we recommend to use the OpenMS Viewer <b>TOPPView</b>.

    content: >-
      For the optimization of tool parameters, it is recommended not to work
      with a complete LC-MS/MS run. Instead, we will use <b>FileFilter</b> to
      extract a small RT-slice of our input dataset, i.e. a fraction of the
      original dataset that was measured during a short period of time. Reducing
      the test data reduces the time needed for analysis and facilitates visual
      examination of the data.

      Be aware that only very small parts of your dataset can be checked by
      visual examination. To minimize biases, try to look at the same areas /
      features of each result file. Now we will reduce the data and re-run the
      whole workflow on it.

      For optimization, it is critical to modify <b>only one parameter at a
      time</b>. Also, it is recommended to optimize the tools in the order of
      their position in the workflow. <br><br>In the test dataset, several
      peptides were identified, but not quantified. Some of the peptides were
      even identified in the unlabelled, as well as in the labelled form. To
      optimize the feature detection, we will relax the parameters of
      FeatureFinderMultiplex.

      peptides for each parameter setting and visualize the results with
