# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

To compare protein amounts in different samples from MS/MS data, two different experiment setups exist. Firstly, unmodified proteins can be measured in separate runs at one sample per MS-run. Secondly, proteins of samples to compare can be labelled with small chemical tags, mixed, and measured side-by-side in a single MS-run.
There are two types of chemical tags:
  1. Isobaric tags display the same mass on first hand, but fragment during the generation of the MS/MS spectra to yield reporter ions of different mass. The intensity of those reporter ions can be compared in MS/MS spectra. There are two types of isobaric tags commercially available: *tandem mass tags* (TMT) and *isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation* (iTRAQ).
  2. Isotopic tags are chemically identical, but differ in their mass due to incorporated stable isotopes. Examples of different isotopic tags for stable isotope labelling (SIL) are ICAT, SILAC, dimethylation, or heavy oxygen (<sup>18</sup>O).

This tutorial deals with protein quantitation via stable isotope labelling (SIL). For isotopic tags, quantitation can be achieved by comparing the intensity of MS1 peptide mass traces. The whole MS1 profile of a peptide, i.e. the intensities of all its isotopic peaks over time, is called a *peptide feature* (Figure 1a). 
Incorporation of stable isotopes results in different peptide masses on MS1 level, which give rise to coeluting ion traces in the TIC with a mass difference typical for each different chemical tag (Figure 1b). Figure originally published in [Nilse et al, 2015](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25931027).

In this tutorial, we will use tools of the [OpenMS suite](http://www.openms.org) to identify and quantify peptides and proteins.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Introduction
> In the hands-on section of this tutorial, we will use a quantitative comparison of HEK cell lysate as a test dataset. In this experiment, HEK cells were once labelled with light, once with heavy SILAC. Both cultures were lysed simultaneously and the cell lysates were mixed in a certain ratio. 
> A detailed description of the full dataset is available in the [PRIDE archive]().
>
> Your objective in this hands-on-tutorial is to find out the correct mixing ratio of the test sample.
>

# MS1 Feature Detection
MS1 feature detection is a critical step in quantitative workflows. In principle, there are two different ways to define features:
1. Feature detection solely based upon MS1 data (mzML/raw files) without prior knowledge of peptide identifications (IDs).
    - Advantage: Feature results can be used to assist in peptide identification.
    - Drawback: Not all peptide identifications can be mapped to features, thus not every identified peptide can be quantified.
2. Feature detection based upon peptide IDs.
    - Advantage: Most peptide IDs trigger a feature detection.
    - Drawback: Feature results cannot be used to improve peptide ID.

The OpenMS suite provides several tools (FeatureFinders) for MS1 feature detection. For SIL we have to use ***FeatureFinderMultiplex***, which does not take peptide IDs as an input.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: MS1 Feature Detection

> 1. Import the test dataset from [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1051552). The data have been preprocessed during the conversion from the machine raw file. We used background removal on MS1 and MS2 level, and MS2 deisotoping.
> 2. Run ***FeatureFinderMultiplex*** {% icon tool %} with
>   - the mzML file as **LC-MS dataset in centroid or profile mode**,
>   - **Labels used for labelling the samples** set to `[ ][Arg6,Lys6]`, 
>   - **m/z tolerance for search of peak patterns** set to `10`, and
>   - **Maximum number of missed cleavages due to incomplete digestion** set to `1`.
>
>   > ### {% icon comment %} Comment: Multiple labels per peptide
>   > When using SILAC-KR or dimethyl-labelling and trypsin digestion, exactly one labelled amino acid per peptide is expected. The only labelled amino acids are lysine (K) and arginine (R) and trypsin cuts after each of them. However, a small percentage of missed cleavage normally occur also in those datasets. Setting **Maximum number of missed cleavages due to incomplete digestion** to `1` will be sufficient to deal with most missed cleavages.
>   >
>   > When using other enzymes (e.g. Lys-C) or other labels (e.g. <sup>18</sup>O), several labelled amino acids per peptide are expected. You can search for those features by increasing the parameter **Maximum number of missed cleavages due to incomplete digestion**.

# Peptide and Protein Identification

In this tutorial, peptide identification will be performed using the workflow of the previous [Peptide ID Tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/proteomics/tutorials/protein-id-oms/tutorial.html). 

A common problem in mass spectrometry are misassigned mono-isotopic precursor peaks. Although most search engines allow for some adaptation of the monoisotopic peak, we will instead perform a recalculation of the monoisotopic peaks based on the previously identified features prior to peptide identification.
This step facilitates mapping peptide IDs to identified features [later on](#mapping-identifications-to-features). To do so, we will use the OpenMS tool ***HighResPrecursorMassCorrector*** {% icon tool %}.

# Mapping Identifications to Features

We now have feature quantifications for MS1 elution peaks, peptide identifications for the MS2 spectra and protein identifications. 
The next step is to map the MS2-based peptide identifications to the quantified MS1 precursor peaks ("peptide features"). This will enable the quantification of identified peptides.
For labelled data, it is necessary to map peptide identifications to *consensus* features (i.e. a pair of one light peptide feature with one matching heavy feature in the correct m/z distance).
For `consensusXML`, IDMapper uses the consensus centroids, not the feature boundaries for mapping. Therefore, the RT tolerance has to be set higher than for mapping to `featureXML`. A good starting value is half the expected typical retention time.

Sometimes several peptide identifications are mapped to a feature. The tool [IDConflictResolver](http://ftp.mi.fu-berlin.de/pub/OpenMS/release-documentation/html/TOPP_IDConflictResolver.html) filters the mapping so that only the identification with the best score is associated to each feature.

Finally, we will combine the peptide quantifications to protein quantifications.

# Descriptive Statistics and Plotting of Protein Quantitations
***ProteinQuantifier*** produces two output tables: the first one gives information about the quantified proteins, the second one gives information about the quantified peptides.
For proteins, we added a log-transformed ratio to the output, which is saved in column 8 of the protein table. The ratio is calculated as **log2 (abundance2/abundance1)**, which is sometimes called the *fold change (FC)* ratio.

To get a quick overview of the results, you can calculate basic descriptive statistics and plot the data as a histogram.
Comment lines in the beginning of a `tabular` file may sometimes cause errors, therefore we will remove them with the tool ***Select last (tail)***.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Descriptive Statistics
> 1. Run ***Summary Statistics*** {% icon tool %} with

>   - **Text file** set to the ***ProteinQuantifier*** protein table output,
>   - **Operation** set to `Keep everything from this line on`, and

>   > ### {% icon tip %} Tip: Calculating descriptive statistics for peptides
>   > The peptide table output of ***ProteinQuantifier*** does not give the log-transformed ratio for each peptide. Nonetheless, you may calculate basic statistics of the FC values by running ***Summary Statistics*** with **Column or expression** set to `log(c6/c5,2)`.

>   > 2. What might have been the mixing ratio of the input dataset?
>   > 3. In the histogram, there is a second local maximum at about FC 0. What might that mean?
>   >
>   >  > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
>   >  > 1.    With the above parameters, you should have quantified 818 peptides and 407 proteins.
>   >  > 2. In the histogram, you see that the peak of the density curve is between -1.1 and -1.2. In the summary statistics, you can see that the mean protein ratio was -0.98. An FC of -1 indicates that the unlabelled proteins were twice as abundant as their heavy-labelled counterparts. Indeed, the mixing ratio of the dataset was 2 parts light labelled HEK cell lysate and 1 part heavy labelled HEK cell lysate.
>   >  > 3. Some proteins were quantified with an FC close to 0. These may stem from incomplete SILAC labelling. Even after two weeks of cell culture in SILAC medium, some proteins with a very low turnover rate may remain unlabelled.

# Evaluation and Optimization of Quantitation Results
Protein quantitation is a multi-step procedure. Many parameters of different steps influence the final results. Therefore, it is recommended to optimize the tool parameters for each dataset and to carefully evaluate quantitation results. While the total number of quantified proteins is a first important parameter for optimization, it is also necessary to visualize the results and check for correct feature finding and ID mapping.

Galaxy does not provide a tool for proteomics visualization, we recommend to use the OpenMS Viewer ***TOPPView***.
Basic TOPPView tutorials are available as [videos](https://www.openms.de/getting-started/command-line-and-visualisations/) and a more comprehensive tutorial as [HTML](http://ftp.mi.fu-berlin.de/pub/OpenMS/release-documentation/html/TOPP_TOPPView.html) or [PDF](http://ftp.mi.fu-berlin.de/pub/OpenMS/release-documentation/TOPP_tutorial.pdf).

For the optimization of tool parameters, it is recommended not to work with a complete LC-MS/MS run. Instead, we will use ***FileFilter*** to extract a small *RT-slice* of our input dataset, i.e. a fraction of the original dataset that was measured during a short period of time. Reducing the test data reduces the time needed for analysis and facilitates visual examination of the data.

Using Galaxy Workflows enables us to quickly re-run a full analysis with changed parameters. To learn about Galaxy Workflows, consult this [tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-history-to-workflow/tutorial.html).

**Cave:** Be aware that only very small parts of your dataset can be checked by visual examination. To minimize biases, try to look at the same areas / features of each result file.

## Examples
1. **Displaying annotated vs. UNannotated features**: visualize annotated (= mapped) and unannotated (= unmapped) features by switching between activating only the "Annotated_features.consensusxml" or only the "UNannotated_features.consensusxml" layer
    ![displaying feature annotations](../../images/protein-quant-sil_example_featureAnnotation.png "The feature below was mapped to and annotated with a peptide identification, the feature above was not mapped. A) Annotated layer is active. B) UNannotated layer is active.")

2. **Correct mapping**: a feature was detected, a peptide was identified and the two were mapped.
    ![Correct mapping of a high-abundant peptide](../../images/protein-quant-sil_example_highAbundant.png "A high-abundant peptide. A) 2D View. B) 3D View.")
    ![Correct mapping of a low-abundant peptide](../../images/protein-quant-sil_example_lowAbundant.png "A low-abundant peptide. A) 2D View. B) 3D View.")

3. **No feature detected for a contaminant.** Contaminants are often not labelled, but occur only in their unlabelled isoform. Therefore, they do not give rise to a consensus feature in FeatureFinderMultiplex.
    ![contaminant](../../images/protein-quant-sil_example_contaminant.png "A contaminant. There are no elution peaks for the heavy labelled peptide isoform. A) 2D View. B) 3D View.")

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Check a possible contaminant
> 1. Run ***TextExporter*** with
>   - the IDFilter output file as the **Input file**.
> 2. Run ***Search in textfiles (grep)*** with
>   - **Select lines from** set to the TextExporter output file, and
>   - **Regular Expression** set to the peptide sequence (e.g. "MFLSFPTTK")
> 3. Check if the peptide was mapped to a protein marked with "CONTAMINANT".
{: .hands_on}

## Typical Problems
Three problems typically hamper correct peptide mapping:
1. **A feature is detected, but no peptide identification is nearby.**
    - *Possible cause*: This may be caused by imperfect peptide identification. However, it is never expected that every single MS2-spectrum leads to an identification. The protein might be missing in the database, or the peptide may carry a modification that was not included in the search.
    - *Possible solution*: Improve your search engine settings.
    ![noID](../../images/protein-quant-sil_problem_noID.png "Several features without peptide IDs. Several MS2 spectra were generated (fragment scan precursors marked with red circles), but did not lead to a peptide identification.")
2. **A peptide was identified, but no feature is nearby.**
    - *Possible cause*: 
        1. The elution peaks of the peptide may be distorted. This is typical for low intensity peptides. If a lot of peptides have distorted elution peaks this may be a sign of spray instability.
        2. The peptide is a contaminant.
    - *Possible solution*: 
        1. Lower the FeatureFinderMultiplex parameters **Two peptides in a multiplet are expected to have the same isotopic pattern** and/or **The isotopic pattern of a peptide should resemble the averagine model at this m/z position** or broaden the **Range of isotopes per peptide in the sample** (in **Advanced Options**).
        2. No optimization of parameters is needed (see [example above](#examples))
    ![noID](../../images/protein-quant-sil_problem_noFeature.png "A peptide was identified in its unlabelled and in its labelled isoform, but no feature was detected. A) 2D View. No third isotopic peak was detected for the labelled peptide. B) 3D View.")
3. **A peptide was identified and a feature was detected nearby, but the two are not mapped to each other.**
    - *Possible cause*: 
        1. The MS2 event and the feature are too far apart to be mapped.
        2. The precursor of the MS2 was not correctly assigned to the mono-isotopic peak.
        3. The detected feature is too small in RT dimension and covers only a part of the peptide peaks.
    - *Possible solution*: 
        1. Increase the IDMapper parameter **RT tolerance (in seconds) for the matching of peptide identifications and (consensus) features**.
        2. Increase the HighResPrecursorMassCorrector parameter **Additional retention time tolerance added to feature boundaries**
        3. Feature size in RT dimension cannot be directly corrected, use solution 1 instead.
    ![noMapping](../../images/protein-quant-sil_problem_noMapping.png "A feature was detected, but the RT dimension is shorter than the peptides's elution peak. Also, the 2nd isotopic peak was fragmented and was not corrected due to the short feature. A) 2D View. B) 3D View.")

Two problems typically disturb correct peptide quantitation:
1. **A peptide is mapped to the wrong feature.**
    - *Possible cause*: Co-eluting peptides of a similar mass may be falsely mapped to a nearby feature, if the correct peptide did not lead to an identification or was identified only with a low score. In *high-resolution data*, this problem of is very limited. Co-eluting peptides can normally be distinguished by slightly different m/z values. In *low-resolution data*, wrong assignment may occur more often. 
    - *Possible solution*: If a high value is used for the precursor mass tolerance, try to keep the RT tolerance low to avoid false mapping.
2. **Background noise (1) or co-eluting peptides (2) are incorporated in a feature.**
    - *Possible solution*: 
        1. Use noise-filtering either during pre-processing or by increasing the FeatureFinderMultiplex parameter **Lower bound for the intensity of isotopic peaks**
        2. Reduce the FeatureFinderMultiplex parameter **m/z tolerance for search of peak patterns**.

## Optimization of Quantitation Results
For optimization, it is critical to modify **only one parameter at a time**.
Also, it is recommended to optimize the tools in the order of their position in the workflow.

In the test dataset, several peptides were identified, but not quantified. Some of the peptides were even identified in the unlabelled, as well as in the labelled form. To optimize the feature detection, we will relax the parameters of FeatureFinderMultiplex.
