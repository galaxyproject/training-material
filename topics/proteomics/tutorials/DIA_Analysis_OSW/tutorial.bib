abstract = {{\"{i}}¿½ Springer Science+Business Media LLC 2017. Targeted mass spectrometry comprises a set of methods able to quantify protein analytes in complex mixtures with high accuracy and sensitivity. These methods, e.g., Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) and SWATH MS, use specific mass spectrometric coordinates (assays) for reproducible detection and quantification of proteins. In this protocol, we describe how to analyze, in a targeted manner, data from a SWATH MS experiment aimed at monitoring thousands of proteins reproducibly over many samples. We present a standard SWATH MS analysis workflow, including manual data analysis for quality control (based on Skyline) as well as automated data analysis with appropriate control of error rates (based on the OpenSWATH workflow). We also discuss considerations to ensure maximal coverage, reproducibility, and quantitative accuracy.},

@article{Ludwig2018,
abstract = {Many research questions in fields such as personalized medicine, drug screens or systems biology depend on obtaining consistent and quantitatively accurate proteomics data from many samples. SWATH‐MS is a specific variant of data‐independent acquisition (DIA) methods and is emerging as a technology that combines deep proteome coverage capabilities with quantitative consistency and accuracy. In a SWATH‐MS measurement, all ionized peptides of a given sample that fall within a specified mass range are fragmented in a systematic and unbiased fashion using rather large precursor isolation windows. To analyse SWATH‐MS data, a strategy based on peptide‐centric scoring has been established, which typically requires prior knowledge about the chromatographic and mass spectrometric behaviour of peptides of interest in the form of spectral libraries and peptide query parameters. This tutorial provides guidelines on how to set up and plan a SWATH‐MS experiment, how to perform the mass spectrometric measurement and how to analyse SWATH‐MS data using peptide‐centric scoring. Furthermore, concepts on how to improve SWATH‐MS data acquisition, potential trade‐offs of parameter settings and alternative data analysis strategies are discussed.Mol Syst Biol. (2018) 14: e8126},
