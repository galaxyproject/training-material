      In this so-called “bottom-up” procedure, only peptide masses are measured.
      Therefore, protein identification cannot be performed directly from raw
      data, but is a multi-step process:

      <ul>
        <li>Raw data preparations</li>
        <li>Peptide-to-Spectrum matching</li>
        <li>Peptide inference</li>
        <li>Protein inference</li>
      </ul>

      A plethora of different software solutions exists for each step. In this
      tutorial, we will show how to use <b>msconvert</b>  and
      <b>PeakPickerHiRes</b> :wrench: for step 1, <b>Search GUI</b> and
      <b>Peptide Shaker</b> :wrench: for the steps 2-4.

  - title: Input data
    content: >-
      As an example dataset, we will use an LC-MS/MS analysis of HeLa cell
      lysate published in <a
      href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24678044">Vaudel et al., 2014,
      Proteomics</a>. Detailed information about the dataset can be found on <a
      href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD000674">PRIDE</a>.
      For step 2 we will use a validated human Uniprot FASTA database without
      appended decoys. If you already completed the tutorial on <a
      href="https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/proteomics/tutorials/database-handling/tutorial.html">Database
      Handling</a> you can use the constructed database before the

      Raw data conversion is the first step of any proteomic data analysis. The
      most common converter is MSConvert, the format to convert to is mzML.
      Search GUI takes only mgf format as input, but as we need the mzML format
      for several other tasks, we will convert to mzML first.

      Depending on your machine settings, raw data will be generated either in

      have to be converted to centroid mode, a process called “peak picking”.
      Machine vendors offer algorithms to extract peaks from profile raw data.
      This is implemented in <b>msconvert</b>  and can be run in parallel to the
      mzML conversion. However, the OpenMS tool <b>PeakPickerHiRes</b> :wrench:

  - title: Peptide and Protein Identification
    content: >-
      MS/MS experiments identify peptides by isolating them and subsequently
      colliding them with a gas for fragmentation. This method generates a
      spectrum of peptide fragment masses for each isolated peptide - an MS2
      spectrum. To find out the peptide sequences, the MS2 spectrum is compared
      to a theoretical spectrum generated from a protein database. This step is
      called peptide-to-spectrum (also: spectrum-to-sequence) matching.
      Accordingly, a peptide that is successfully matched to a sequence is
      termed PSM (Peptide-Spectrum-Match). There can be multiple PSMs per
      peptide, if the peptide was fragmented several times. Different peptide
      search engines have been developed to fulfill the matching procedure.

      <br><br>It is generally recommended to use more than one peptide search
      engine and use the combined results for the final peptide inference (<a
      href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23720762>Shteynberg et al.,
      2013, Mol. Cell. Proteomics</a>). Again, there are several software
      solutions for this, e.g. iProphet (TPP) or ConsensusID (OpenMS). In this
      tutorial we will use <b>Search GUI</b>, as it can automatically search the
      data using several search engines. Its partner tool <b>Peptide Shaker</b>
      :wrench: is then used to combine and evaluate the search engine results.

      <br><br>In bottom-up proteomics, it is necessary to combine the identified
      peptides to proteins. This is not a trivial task, as proteins are
      redundant to some degree. Thus, not every peptide can be assigned to only
      one protein. Luckily, the <b>Peptide Shaker</b>  already takes care of
      protein inference and even gives us some information on validity of the
      protein IDs. We will discuss validation in a <a

      Search GUI bundles numerous sequence database search software tools for
      matching MS/MS to peptide sequences within a database. Describing the
      parameters for all of these programs is beyond the scope of this tutorial,
      but some of the key parameters for this software are described below:

      <ul>
        <li><b>Database search programs.</b> A number of popular sequence database searching programs are available, and can be selected by the user. The more selected, the more processor time is necessary; however, matching MS/MS spectra to peptide sequence with more programs provides more confidence in results. In practice, 2-3 programs used offers high confidence while keeping analysis times reasonable.</li>
      </ul>
    backdrop: true
  - title: Important Search GUI Parameters 2/3
    content: |-
      <ul>
        <li><b>Data quality parameters.</b> Values that reflect the performance of the instrument used can be entered. These include mass accuracy measures for both precursor ions and the resulting MS/MS fragment ions. For the workflow provided here, these have been set with default values for high resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometer instrumentation.</li>
        <li><b>Enzyme cleavage.</b> Although almost all proteomic samples are digested to peptides by trypsin, some other enzymes are used occasionally. Enzymes do not cut at 100 % of the possible cleavage sites, so you might want to allow searching for peptides where a few cleavage sites were missed.</li>
      </ul>
    backdrop: true
  - title: Important Search GUI Parameters 3/3
    content: |-
      <ul>
        <li><b>Covalent modifications.</b> A variety of covalent modifications are built in to the Search GUI parameters. Typing the modification into the field (e.g. “oxidation”) brings up the available modifications of that type to specific side chains or the n- or c-terminus of the protein and/or peptide.</li>
      </ul>
    backdrop: true
  - title: Important Peptide Shaker Parameters 1/2
    content: >-
      The Galaxy implementation of Peptide Shaker is fairly simple in terms of
      parameters available to the user:

      <ul>
        <li><b>Processing and filtering options.</b> If desired, users can select “Advanced” processing or filtering options. The processing options allow a customized level of false discovery rate (FDR) to be set for peptide and protein identifications, while the filtering options offer selection of length of peptides to be considered, and thresholds for mass accuracy. The default, validated values for processing and filtering are set in stored workflows, and follow community standards (e.g. 1% FDR levels, etc.).</li>
      </ul>
    backdrop: true
  - title: Important Peptide Shaker Parameters 2/2
    content: |-
      <ul>
        <li><b>Outputs</b>Peptide Shaker offers a variety of outputs which a user can select. A compressed file (.zip) can be made containing all information needed to view the results in the standalone Peptide Shaker viewer; a peptide spectrum match (PSM) report file, which provides all relevant information on all peptide sequences matched to MS/MS spectra in the analysis; a mzidentML file can be created that contains all peptide sequence matching information and can be utilized by compatible downstream software. Other outputs are focused on the inferred proteins identified from the PSMs, as well as phosphorylation reports, relevant in a phosphoprotoemics experiment has been undertaken. The Certificate of Analysis provides details on all the parameters used by both Search GUI and Peptide Shaker in the analysis. All outputs can be downloaded from the Galaxy instance to the local computer if desired.</li>
      </ul>
    backdrop: true
  - title: Analysis of Contaminants
    content: >-
      The FASTA database used for the peptide to spectrum matching contained
      some entries that were not expected to stem from the HeLa cell lysate, but
      are common contaminations in LC-MS/MS samples. The main reason to add
      those is to avoid false assignment of the spectra to other proteins.
      However, it also enables you to check for contaminations in your samples.
      <b>CAVE:</b> in human samples, many proteins that are common contaminants
      may also stem from the real sample. The real source can never be
      determined for sure.
