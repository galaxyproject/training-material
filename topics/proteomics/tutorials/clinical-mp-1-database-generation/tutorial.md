Metaproteomics is the large-scale characterization of the entire complement of proteins expressed by microbiota. However, metaproteomics analysis of clinical samples is challenged by the presence of abundant human (host) proteins which hampers the confident detection of lower abundant microbial proteins {% cite Batut2018 %} ; [{% cite Jagtap2015 %} .

To address this, we used tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and bioinformatics tools on the Galaxy platform to develop a metaproteomics workflow to characterize the metaproteomes of clinical samples. This clinical metaproteomics workflow holds potential for general clinical applications such as potential secondary infections during COVID-19 infection, microbiome changes during cystic fibrosis as well as broad research questions regarding host-microbe interactions.

The first workflow for the clinical metaproteomics data analysis is the Database generation workflow. The Galaxy-P team has developed a workflow wherein a large database is generated by downloading protein sequences of known disease-causing microorganisms and then generating a compact database from the comprehensive database using the Metanovo tool.

# Step-by-step analysis

## Download Protein Sequences using taxon names
First, we want to generate a large comprehensive protein sequence database using the UniProt XML Downloader to extract sequences for species of interest. To do so, you will need a tabular file that contains a list of species.

For this tutorial, a literature survey was conducted to obtain 118 taxonomic species of organisms that are commonly associated with the female reproductive tract {% cite AfiuniZadeh2018 %}. This species list was used to generate a protein sequence FASTA database was generated using the UniProt XML Downloader tool within the Galaxy framework. In this tutorial, the Species FASTA database (~3.38 million sequences) has already been provided as input. However, if you have your own list of species of interest as a tabular file (`Your_Species_tabular.tabular`), steps to generate a FASTA file from a tabular file are included:

## Merging databases to obtain a large comprehensive database for MetaNovo
Once generated, the Species UniProt database (~3.38 million sequences) will be merged with the Human SwissProt database (reviewed only; ~20.4K sequences) and contaminant (cRAP) sequences database (116 sequences) and filtered to generate the large comprehensive database (~2.59 million sequences). The large comprehensive database will be used to generate a compact database using MetaNovo, which is much more manageable.

# Reducing Database size

## Metanovo tool generates a compact database from your comprehensive database with **MetaNovo**
Next, the large comprehensive database of ~2.59 million sequences can be reduced using the MetaNovo tool to generate a more manageable database that contains identified proteins.

The compact MetaNovo-generated database (~1.9K sequences) will be merged with Human SwissProt (reviewed only) and contaminants (cRAP) databases to generate the reduced database (~21.2k protein sequences) that will be used for peptide identification (see [Discovery Module tutorial](https://github.com/subinamehta/training-material/blob/main/topics/proteomics/tutorials/clinical-mp-discovery/tutorial.md)).

# Conclusion

The first step for the Clinical Metaproteomics study is database generation. As we didn’t have a reference database or information from 16srRNA-seq data, we generated a fasta database doing a literature survey, however, if 16S rRNA data is present, the taxon identified can be used for a customized database generation. As the size of the comprehensive database is generally  too large, we used the Metanovo tool to reduce the size of the database. This reduced database will be then used for clinical metaproteomics discovery workflow.
