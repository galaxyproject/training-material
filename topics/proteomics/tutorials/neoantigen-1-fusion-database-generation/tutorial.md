A neoantigen is a novel peptide (protein fragment) that is produced by cancer cells due to mutations, including gene fusions, that alter the DNA sequence in a way that generates unique proteins not found in normal cells. Because these mutated proteins are unique to the tumor, they are recognized as "foreign" by the immune system. Neoantigens are valuable in immunotherapy because they can serve as specific targets for the immune system, allowing treatments to selectively attack cancer cells while sparing normal tissue. By stimulating an immune response specifically against these neoantigens, therapies like cancer vaccines or T-cell-based treatments can be developed to enhance the bodyâ€™s natural defense mechanisms, making neoantigens a promising avenue for personalized cancer treatment.

Creating a fusion database is essential in cancer genomics and personalized medicine, as it enables the identification of crucial biomarkers, enhances diagnostic accuracy, and supports therapeutic development. Gene fusions, where parts of two previously separate genes merge, can produce abnormal proteins that drive cancer. Cataloging these fusion events in a database helps researchers identify specific biomarkers linked to cancer types and design more targeted treatments. Additionally, fusion events may lead to unique peptide sequences, known as neoantigens, which are found only in cancer cells. These neoantigens can be targeted by the immune system, making fusion databases valuable in designing personalized immunotherapies like cancer vaccines or T-cell therapies. Some gene fusions also create oncogenic proteins that promote tumor growth, such as the BCR-ABL fusion in chronic myeloid leukemia. Including such information in a database aids in identifying potential therapeutic targets and predicting treatment efficacy. On the diagnostic side, known gene fusions serve as reliable markers, helping clinicians better classify cancer types and choose the most effective treatments. Finally, fusion databases provide a critical reference for researchers studying fusion mechanisms, their impact on disease progression, and their prevalence across cancers, ultimately fueling the discovery of novel treatments and therapies.

To generate the fusion database, RNA star and Arriba tools are used in this workflow.

# Neoantigen Fusion Database Generation

## Overview of Fusion Neoantigen Database Workflow

The workflow in this tutorial guides users through the generation of a fusion neoantigen database, covering key steps in bioinformatics to identify, filter, and prepare fusion-specific peptides for further immunological study. Below is an overview of each major stage:

### 1. Get Data
The process begins with the upload and quality assessment of raw sequencing data, which is then uncompressed. This stage sets the groundwork for all subsequent analyses.

### 2. Fusion Detection and Alignment
RNA sequencing data undergoes alignment to a reference genome using tools like **RNA STAR**, followed by **Arriba** to detect fusion events. These tools identify gene fusions and help characterize the gene segments that combine to form new fusion genes.

### 3. Filtering and Refinement
After identifying fusions, various filters are applied to remove non-specific or common fusion events using blacklist data and other criteria. This step ensures that only relevant, unique fusion events are retained for neoantigen prediction.

### 4. Peptide Sequence Extraction and Formatting
Potential neoantigen peptides are extracted from the fusion gene sequences. Using tools such as **Text Reformatting** and **Tabular-to-FASTA**, the data is transformed into formats suitable for further immunological analysis.

### 5. Final Database Formatting
The workflow concludes by applying regex adjustments and formatting functions to standardize the output, creating a database of potential fusion neoantigens.

### Summary
This workflow provides a structured approach to preparing fusion neoantigen data for downstream applications, such as immunotherapy research, by making fusion-derived peptides accessible in a database for experimental or clinical exploration.

# Data preparation


## Convert compressed file to uncompressed

Uncompressing data is a crucial first step in many bioinformatics workflows because raw sequencing data files, especially from high-throughput sequencing, are often stored in compressed formats (such as `.gz` or `.zip`) to save storage space and facilitate faster data transfer. Compressed files need to be uncompressed to make the data readable and accessible for analysis tools, which generally require the data to be in plain text or other compatible formats. By uncompressing these files, we ensure that downstream applications can efficiently process and analyze the raw sequencing data without compatibility issues related to compression. In this workflow, we do that for both forward and reverse files.

## Alignment with RNA STAR

**RNA STAR** (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference) is a high-performance tool used to align RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reads to a reference genome. It identifies the best matches between RNA reads and genome sequences by detecting exon-exon junctions, which are critical for accurately mapping reads from spliced transcripts. RNA STAR uses a "two-pass" mapping approach that first identifies splice junctions across all reads and then uses these junctions to guide a more accurate alignment on the second pass. This capability is especially valuable for studying gene expression, discovering novel splice variants, and identifying fusion genes in cancer and other disease research. The output includes aligned sequences that can be used in subsequent steps of bioinformatics pipelines, such as fusion detection and differential expression analysis.

## Fusion detection with Arriba

**Arriba** is a specialized tool used for detecting gene fusions from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. It is particularly focused on identifying fusion events in cancer, where gene fusions can drive oncogenic processes. Arriba uses the output from **RNA STAR** alignments, specifically looking at chimeric alignments that result from fusion transcripts, and applies a series of filtering steps to reduce false positives. 

Arribaâ€™s pipeline includes features for:
- Filtering out common artifacts and false-positive fusions based on blacklisted regions.
- Annotating fusion breakpoints.
- Generating a visualization of detected fusion events.

The output includes a list of fusion candidates with key information like fusion partners, breakpoint locations, reading frames, and peptide sequences. Arribaâ€™s results can provide insight into potential neoantigens, helping guide research into therapeutic targets or immune-based therapies for cancer.

## Clean up data using Text reformatting

**Text Reformatting** is a step used in bioinformatics workflows to manipulate and clean up data for easier downstream processing. In fusion detection workflows, text reformatting is often used to parse and restructure output files, making the data consistent and accessible for subsequent analysis steps.

In this workflow, text reformatting involves:
- Extracting specific columns or fields from tabular outputs, such as gene names, breakpoint coordinates, or fusion peptide sequences.
- Formatting peptide sequences and related information into specific columns or concatenating fields for unique identifiers.
- Converting the data into a consistent format that downstream tools can interpret, such as converting tab-separated values into a structured layout for database input or analysis.

The reformatting step ensures that the processed data adheres to the requirements of other tools, enabling seamless integration across the workflow and supporting reliable, interpretable final results.

##  Transform data using Tabular-to-FASTA

Tabular to FASTA conversion is a common task in bioinformatics that transforms data structured in a tabular format (such as CSV or TSV) into FASTA format, widely used for representing nucleotide or protein sequences. This conversion is essential when sequence data needs to be input into various bioinformatics tools or databases that require FASTA-formatted files.
