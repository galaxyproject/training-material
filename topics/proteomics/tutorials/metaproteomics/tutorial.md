# Introduction

In this metaproteomics tutorial we will identify expressed proteins from a complex bacterial community sample.
For this MS/MS data will be matched to peptide sequences provided through a FASTA file.

Metaproteomics is the large-scale characterization of the entire protein complement of environmental microbiota
at a given point in time. It has the potential to unravel the mechanistic details of microbial interactions with
the host / environment by analyzing the functional dynamics of the microbiome.

# Pretreatments

## Data upload

There are a many ways how you can upload your data. Three among these are:

*   Upload the files from your computer
*   Using a direct weblink
*   Import from the data library if your instance provides the files

In this tutorial, we will get the data from Zenodo: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.820308.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.820308).

# Analysis

## Match peptide sequences

The search database labelled `FASTA_Bering_Strait_Trimmed_metapeptides_cRAP.FASTA` is the input database that
will be used to match MS/MS to peptide sequences via a sequence database search.
For this, the sequence database-searching program called **SearchGUI** will be used.
The created dataset collection of the three *MGF files* in the history is used as the MS/MS input.

Once the database search is completed, the SearchGUI tool will output a file (called a
SearchGUI archive file) that will serve as an input for the next section, PeptideShaker.

#### PeptideShaker

**PeptideShaker** is a post-processing software tool that
processes data from the SearchGUI software tool. It serves to organize the Peptide-Spectral
Matches (PSMs) generated from SearchGUI processing and is contained in the SearchGUI archive.
It provides an assessment of confidence of the data, inferring proteins identified from the
matched peptide sequences and generates outputs that can be visualized by users to interpret
results. PeptideShaker has been wrapped in Galaxy to work in combination with SearchGUI
outputs.

> ### :nut_and_bolt: Comment

A number of new items will appear in your history, each corresponding to the outputs selected
in the PeptideShaker parameters. Most relevant for this tutorial is the PSM report:

![](../../images/psm_report.png)

Scrolling at the bottom to the left will show the sequence for the PSM that matched to these
metapeptide entries. Column 3 is the sequence matched for each PSM entry. Every PSM is a
new row in the tabular output.

In the following steps of this tutorial, selected portions of this output will be extracted and used for
analysis of the taxonomic make-up of the sample as well as the biochemical functions
represented by the proteins identified.

## Unipept metaproteomic analysis

In the previous section, the genome sequencing and mass spectrometry data from
processing of biological samples was used to identify peptides present in those samples.
Now those peptides are used as evidence to infer which organisms are represented in the sample,
and what biological functions those peptides and associated proteins suggest are occurring.

The UniProt organization collects and annotates all known proteins for organisms. A UniProt
entry includes the protein amino acid sequence, the NCBI taxonomy, and any annotations
about structure and function of the protein. The UniPept web resource developed
by Ghent University will be used to match the sample peptides to proteins. UniPept indexes all Uniprot
proteins and provides a fast matching algorithm for peptides.

#### Recieving the list of peptides: Query Tabular

In order to use *Unipept*, a list containing the peptide sequences has to be generated.
The tool **Query Tabular** can load tabular data (the PSM report in this case) into a SQLite data base.
As a tabular file is being read, line filters may be applied and an SQL query can be performed.

While we can proceed with this list of peptides, let's practice using the created SQLite database for further queries.
We might not only be interested in all the distinct peptides, but also on how many PSMs a single peptide had.
Therefore we can search the database for the peptides and count the occurrence without configuring the tables and columns again:

>
> 1. **SQLite to tabular** :wrench:: Run **SQLite to tabular** with:
>

>         
>          FROM psm
>
>          WHERE validation IS NOT 'Confident' AND confidence >= 95
>          
>          GROUP BY sequence
>
>          ORDER BY sequence
>
> 2. Click **Execute**. The resulting file should have two columns, one with the distinct peptides, the other with the count number of PSMs.

#### Retrieve taxonomy for peptides: Unipept

The generated list of peptides can now be used to search via *Unipept*.
We do a taxonomy analysis using the UniPept pept2lca function to return the taxonomic lowest common ancestor for each peptide:

>    - **Tabular Input Containing Peptide column**: The query results file.
>    - **Select column with peptides**: `Column 1`
>    - **Choose outputs**: Select `tabular` and `JSON taxonomy tree`
>
> 2. Click **Execute**. The history should grow by two files. View each to see the difference.

## Genus taxonomy level summary

The tabular *Unipept* output lists the taxonomy assignments for each peptide. To create a meaningful summary, the **Query Tabular** tool is
once again used, aggregating the number of peptides and PSMs for each genus level taxonomy assignment:
