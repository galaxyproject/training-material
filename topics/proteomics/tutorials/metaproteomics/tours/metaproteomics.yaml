    content: >-
      In this tutorial we will identify expressed proteins from a complex
      bacterial community sample. For this MS/MS data will be matched to peptide
      sequences provided through a FASTA file. <br><br>Metaproteomics is the
      large-scale characterization of the entire protein complement of
      environmental microbiota at a given point in time. It has the potential to
      unravel the mechanistic details of microbial interactions with the host /
      environment by analyzing the functional dynamics of the microbiome.
      <br><br>In this tutorial, we will analyze a sample of sea water that was
      collected in August of 2013 from the Bering Strait chlorophyll maximum
      layer (7m depth, 65° 43.44″ N, 168° 57.42″ W). The data were originally
      published in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27396978">May et

      The search database labelled
      <i>FASTA_Bering_Strait_Trimmed_metapeptides_cRAP.FASTA</i> is the input
      database that will be used to match MS/MS to peptide sequences via a
      sequence database search. It is a small excerpt of the original database,
      which was constructed based on a metagenomic screening of the sea water
      samples (see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27396978">May et
      al. (2016)</a>). The full original database can be accessed from <a
      href="https://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/metapeptide/data/metapeptides_BSt.fasta">here</a>.
      The contaminant database (cRAP) was merged with the original database.
      <br><br>For this, the sequence database-searching program called <a
      href="https://compomics.github.io/projects/searchgui.html">SearchGUI</a>
      will be used. The created dataset collection of the three <i>MGF files</i>
      in the history is used as the MS/MS input.

      software tool. It serves to organize the Peptide-Spectral Matches (PSMs)
      generated from SearchGUI processing and is contained in the SearchGUI
      archive. It provides an assessment of confidence of the data, inferring
      proteins identified from the matched peptide sequences and generates
      outputs that can be visualized by users to interpret results.

      this tutorial is the PSM report. <br><br>Scrolling towards left will show
      the sequence for the PSM that matched to these metapeptide entries. Column
      3 is the sequence matched for each PSM entry. Every identified PSM is a
      new row in the tabular output. <br><br>In the following steps of this
      tutorial, selected portions of this output will be extracted and used for
      analysis of the taxonomic make-up of the sample as well as the biochemical
      functions represented by the proteins identified.

  - title: Taxonomy analysis
    content: >-
      In the previous section, the genome sequencing and mass spectrometry data
      from processing of biological samples was used to identify peptides
      present in those samples. Now those peptides are used as evidence to infer
      which organisms are represented in the sample, and what biological
      functions those peptides and associated proteins suggest are
      occurring.<br><br> The UniProt organization collects and annotates all
      known proteins for organisms. A UniProt entry includes the protein amino
      acid sequence, the NCBI taxonomy, and any annotations about structure and
      function of the protein. The UniPept web resource developed by Ghent
      University will be used to match the sample peptides to proteins. UniPept
      indexes all Uniprot proteins and provides a fast matching algorithm for
      peptides.
