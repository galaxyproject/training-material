# Introduction
{: .no_toc}

**Proteogenomics** involves the use of mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics data against genomics and transcriptomics data to identify peptides and to understand protein-level evidence of gene expression. In the first section of the tutorial, we will create a protein database (FASTA) using RNA-sequencing files (FASTQ) and then perform sequence database searching using the resulting FASTA file with the MS data to identify peptides corresponding to novel proteoforms. Then, we will assign the genomic coordinates and annotations for these identified peptides and visualize the data for its spectral quality and genomic localization

Proteogenomics integrates **RNA-Seq** data for generating customized protein sequence databases with mass spectrometry-based proteomics data, which are matched to these databases to identify protein sequence variants.

# Overview
{: .no_toc}

This tutorial focuses on creating a **FASTA** database generated from RNA-seq data. There are two outputs from this workflow: (1) a **sequence database** consisting of variants and known reference sequences and (2) mapping files containing **genomic** and **variant** mapping data.

![Database creation](../../images/database_creation.png)

The first part of the tutorial deals with creating the FASTA file containing sequences with single amino acid variants (SAVs), insertions and deletions (indels). The second part of the workflow helps in creating a FASTA file with transcript assemblies (splicing variants).


# Data upload

In this tutorial, protein and the total RNA sample was obtained from the early development of B-cells from mice. It was obtained at two developmental stages of B-cells: *Ebf1* -/- pre-pro-B and *Rag2* -/- pro-B. Please refer to the original study  [Heydarian, M. et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4276347/)for details.

# Aligning FASTQ files to the human genome

The first tool in the workflow is the [**HISAT2**](http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat) alignment tool. It maps next-generation sequence (NGS) reads to the reference genome. This tool requires an RNA-seq file (.FASTQ) and a reference genome file in Gene transfer format (GTF). This .gtf file is obtained from the Ensembl database. When successful, this tool outputs a .bam file (binary version of a SAM: **S**equence **A**lignment/**M**ap).

# Variant Analysis

## Variant Calling

[FreeBayes]( https://github.com/ekg/freebayes) is a Bayesian genetic variant detector designed to find small polymorphisms, specifically SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms), indels (insertions and deletions), MNPs (multi-nucleotide polymorphisms), and complex events (composite insertion and substitution events) smaller than the length of a short-read sequencing alignment.

![Variant calling](../../images/variant_calling.png)

Provided with some BAM dataset(s) and a reference sequence, FreeBayes will generate
a VCF dataset describing SNPs, indels, and complex variants in samples in the input
alignments. By default, FreeBayes will consider variants supported by at least two observations
in a single sample (`-C`) and also by at least 20% of the reads from a single sample (`-F`). These
settings are suitable for low to high depth sequencing in haploid and diploid samples, but
users working with polyploid or pooled samples may adjust them depending on the characteristics
of their sequencing data.

FreeBayes is capable of calling variant haplotypes shorter than a read length where multiple
polymorphisms segregate on the same read. The maximum distance between polymorphisms phased in
this way is determined by the `--max-complex-gap`, which defaults to 3bp. In practice, this can
comfortably be set to half the read length. Ploidy may be set to any level (`-p`), but by default
all samples are assumed to be diploid. FreeBayes can model per-sample and per-region variation
in copy-number (`-A`) using a copy-number variation map.

FreeBayes can act as a frequency-based pooled caller and can describe variants and haplotypes in
terms of observation frequency rather than called genotypes. To do so, use --pooled-continuous
and set input filters to a suitable level. Allele observation counts will be described by AO
and RO fields in the VCF output.

## Variant annotation and Genome Mapping

[CustomProDB]( http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt543) generates custom protein FASTA sequences files from exosome or transcriptome data. Once Freebayes creates the .vcf file, CustomProDB uses this file to generate a custom protein FASTA file from the transcriptome data. For this tool, we use Ensembl 89 mmusculus (GRm38.p5) (dbsnp142) as the genome annotation. We create three FASTA files from CustomProDB: (1) a variant FASTA file for short indels, (2) a Single Amino acid Variant (SAV) FASTA file, an SQLite database file (genome mapping and variant mapping) for mapping proteins to a genome and (3) an RData file for variant protein coding sequences.
The reference protein set can be filtered by transcript expression level (RPKM calculated from a BAM file), and variant protein forms can be predicted based on variant calls (SNPs and indels reported in a VCF file).

Annotations CustomProDB depends on a set of annotation files (in RData format) to
create reference and variant protein sequences. Galaxy administrators can use the CustomProDB
data manager to create these annotations to make them available for users.

{: .hands_on}

Three FASTA files are generated through the CustomProDB tool:
- a variant FASTA file for short indels,
- a Single Amino acid Variant (SAV) FASTA file
- an Sqlite file (genome mapping and variant mapping)

for mapping proteins to genome and an RData file for variant protein coding sequences.
Similar to the genomic mapping, a variant mapping file is also generated from CustomProDB.
This SQLite file is also converted to tabular format and made SearchGUI-compatible. This
variant annotation file will be used to visualize the variants in the Multi-omics Visualization
Platform (in-house visualization platform developed by Galaxy-P senior developers).

# Transcript Assembly

## RNA-seq to transcripts

[StringTie](http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/) is a fast and highly efficient assembler of RNA-Seq alignments into potential transcripts. It uses a network flow algorithm as well as an optional *de novo* assembly step to assemble and quantitate full-length transcripts representing multiple splice variants for each gene locus.

Its input can include not only the alignments of raw reads used by other transcript assemblers, but also alignments of longer sequences that have been assembled from those reads. To identify differentially expressed genes between experiments, StringTie's output can be processed by specialized software like Ballgown, Cuffdiff or other programs (DESeq2, edgeR, etc.).


> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Transcript assembly with StringTie
>
> 1. **StringTie** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Input mapped reads"*: `FASTQ_ProB_22LIST.BAM`

>      - {% icon param-select %} *"Use Reference transcripts only?"*: `No`
>      - {% icon param-select %} *"Output files for differential expression?"*: `No additional output`
>
{: .hands_on}

StringTie accepts a BAM (or SAM) file of paired-end RNA-seq reads, which must be
sorted by genomic location (coordinate position). This file contains spliced read alignments
and can be produced directly by programs such as HISAT2. We recommend using HISAT2 as it is a
fast and accurate alignment program. Every spliced read alignment (i.e. an alignment across
at least one junction) in the input BAM file must contain the tag XS to indicate the genomic
strand that produced the RNA from which the read was sequenced. Alignments produced by HISAT2
(when run with the `--dta` option) already include this tag, but if you use a different read mapper
you should check that this XS tag is included for spliced alignments.

> ### {% icon details %} Note about parameter settings
> Be sure to run HISAT2 with the `--dta` option for alignment (under 'Spliced alignment options'),
> for the best results.
>
> Also note that if your reads are from a stranded library, you need to choose the appropriate
> setting for 'Specify strand information' above. As, if Forward (FR) is selected, StringTie will
> assume the reads are from a `--fr` library, while if Reverse (RF) is selected, StringTie will

> option, where fr-firststrand corresponded to RF and fr-secondstrand corresponded to FR).
> If you don't know whether your reads are from a stranded library or not, you could use the

>
> As an option, a reference annotation file in GTF/GFF3 format can be provided to StringTie. In

## Evaluate the assembly with annotated transcripts

[GffCompare](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/gffcompare.shtml) compares and evaluates the accuracy of RNA-Seq transcript assemblers (Cufflinks, Stringtie). * collapse (merge) duplicate transcripts from multiple GTF/GFF3 files (e.g. resulted from assembly of different samples) * classify transcripts from one or multiple GTF/GFF3 files as they relate to reference transcripts provided in a annotation file (also in GTF/GFF3 format)

The original form of this program is also distributed as part of the Cufflinks suite, under the name [CuffCompare](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cuffcompare/). Most of the options and parameters of CuffCompare are supported by GffCompare, while new features will likely be added to GffCompare in the future.

{: .hands_on}

> ### {% icon details %} GffCompare vs CuffCompare
> A notable difference between GffCompare and CuffCompare is that when a single query GTF/GFF file is
> given as input along with a reference annotation (`-r` option), GFFCompare switches into "annotation mode"
> and it generates a `.annotated.gtf` file instead of the `.merged.gtf` produced by CuffCompare with the same
> parameters. This file has the same general format as CuffCompare's .merged.gtf file (with "class
> codes" assigned to transcripts as per their relationship with the matching/overlapping reference,
> transcript) but the original transcript IDs are preserved, so GffCompare can thus be used as a
> simple way of annotating a set of transcripts.
>
> Another important difference is that the input transcripts are no longer discarded when they
> are found to be "intron redundant", i.e. contained within other, longer isoforms. CuffCompare
> had the `-G` option to prevent collapsing of such intron redundant isoforms into their longer
> "containers", but GffCompare has made this the default mode of operation (hence the `-G` option is
> no longer needed and is simply ignored when given).

# Creating FASTA Databases

In this section we will perform the following tasks:
- The **Protein Database Downloader** tool is used to download the FASTA database from UniProt and cRAP (**c**ommon **R**epository of **A**dventitious **P**roteins) database containing known/reference mouse proteins.
- The **Regex Text Manipulation** tool is used to manipulate the FASTA file to make it SearchGUI-compatible.
- The **FASTA Merge Files and Filter Unique Sequences** tool is used to merge the databases obtained from CustomProDB and "Translate BED" tool
along with the UniProt and cRAP databases.

For visualization purposes we also use the concatenate tool to concatenate the genomic mapping with the protein mapping dataset. This output will be used for visualization in MVP to view the genomic coordinates of the variant peptide.

An SQLite database containing the genomic mapping SQLite, variant annotation and information from the protein mapping file is concatenated to form a single genomic mapping SQLite database later used as an input for the 'Peptide Genomic Coordinate' tool. For that we need to follow the steps below:
