# Introduction
{: .no_toc}

The third and the last workflow in the proteogenomics tutorial is to identifying the "**Novel peptides**" using BlastP and to localize the peptides to its genomic coordinates. Inputs from both workflow 1 and 2 will be used in this workflow.

All the files to run this workflow can be obtained from the [second tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link topics/proteomics/tutorials/proteogenomics-dbsearch/tutorial.md %}) output. Once the tabular output is generated, we convert this tabular report into a FASTA file. This can be achieved by using the Tabular to FASTA convertion tool.

# Peptide Selection

Once Blast-P search is performed, it provides a tabular output containing “**Novel peptides**”. Now this output is further processed by comparing the Novel Peptide output with the PSM report for selecting only distinct peptides which meet the criteria.

Once this step is completed, a tabular output containing novel proteoforms are displayed. These novel proteforms fulfill our criteria of not being present in the existing NCBI repository. The next step is to remove any duplicate sequences. For this, we use the Query tabular tool again to select distinct sequences from the tabular output.

# Multiomics Visualization Platform (MVP)

The Multiomics Visualization Platform is a galaxy visualization plugin that allows the user to browse the selected proteomics data. It uses the SQlite database which allows the data to be filtered and aggregated in a user defined manner. It allows various features such as; the PSM can be displayed with a lorikeet spectral view, the selected peptide can be displayed in a protein view and an IGV browser is also available for the selected protein. The step by step guide shown below will provide a walkthrough on how to use this plugin.

The next tool in the workflow is the Peptide genomic coordinate tool which takes the "novel peptides" as the input along with the mztosqlite file and the genomic mapping sqlite file (obtained during creation of the database). This tool helps create a bed file with the genomic coordinate information of the peptides based on the sqlite files.



# Obtain Peptide genomic Coordinates

Gets genomic coordinate of peptides based on the information in mzsqlite and genomic mapping sqlite files. This program
loads two sqlite databases (mzsqlite and genomic mapping sqlite files) and calculates the genomic coordinates of the
peptides provided as input. This outputs bed file for peptides.

# Classify Peptides

Given chromosomal locations of peptides in a BED file, PepPointer classifies them as CDS, UTR, exon, intron, or intergene.

>   - {% icon param-file %} *"BED file with chromosomal coordinates of peptides"*: `Bed file from Peptide genomic coordinate tool`
>
> 2. Click **Execute** and inspect the query results file after it turned green.

The final tool for this workflow generates a tabular output that summarizes the information after running these workflows. The final summary output consists of the Peptide sequence, the spectra associated with the peptides, the protein accession number, chromosome number, Start and Stop of the genomic coordinate, the annotation, the genomic coordinate entry for viewing in Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV), MVP or UCSC genome browser and the URL for viewing it on UCSC genome browser. This summary is created with the help of the query tabular tool.

The Final summary displays a tabular output containing the list of novel peptides and its corresponding protein. It also provides the users with the chromosomal location of the novel proteoform along with the peptide's start and end position.	The output also features the strand information, gene	annotation and the genomic coordinates in a specific format that could be used on IGV or UCSC browser. It also provides the user with a	UCSC Genome Browser link, which the user can directly copy and paste it on a web browser to learn more about the novel proteoform. Here we are demonstrating the use of proteogenomics workflow on an example trimmed mouse dataset. This study explores the possibilities for downstream biological /functional analysis of peptides corresponding to novel proteoforms.

### What's next?

This completes the proteogenomics workflow analysis. This training workflow uses mouse data. For any other organism the data, tool paramters and the workflow will need to be modified accordingly.

Please look at the following tutorials in this proteogenomics series:
1. [Proteogenomics database creation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link topics/proteomics/tutorials/proteogenomics-dbcreation/tutorial.md %})
2. [Proteogenomics database search]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link topics/proteomics/tutorials/proteogenomics-dbsearch/tutorial.md %})

This workflow is also available at [Proteogenomics gateway](http://galaxyp-proteogenomics.duckdns.org/).

This workflow was developed by the Galaxy-P team at the University of Minnesota.
