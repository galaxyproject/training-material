# Introduction
{:.no_toc}


Several computational methods have been proven very useful in the initial screening and prediction of peptides for various biological properties. These methods have emerged as effective alternatives to the lengthy and expensive traditional experimental approaches. In this tutorial, we will be discussing how to analyze peptide libraries on the basis of quantitative properties. In this tutorial, we will learn how to use different utilities of PDAUG to calculate various peptide-based features and utilize these features for various informative plots.

## Peptide Data

In this step, we will retrieve the inbuild dataset, which contains anti-microbial (AMPs) and transmembrane peptides (TMPs).

## Converting tabular data into fasta format

In this step, we will be converting and splitting the tabular data file into fasta format. This tool splits data into two files based on their class labels.

## Analyzing peptide libraries (AMPs and TMPs) based on features and feature space 

### Summary Plot for peptide libraries 

In this step, we utilize **PDAUG Peptide Sequence Analysis** tool to compare peptide sequences based on hydrophobicity, hydrophobic movement, charge, amino acid fraction, and sequence length and create a summary plot.

### Assessing feature space distribution 

In this tool, we have used **PDAUG Fisher's Plot** that compare two peptide libraries based on the feature space using the Fisher test.

>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Second fasta file"*: `PDAUG TSVtoFASTA on data 1 - second (fasta)` (second output of **PDAUG TSVtoFASTA** {% icon tool %})
>    - *"Label for first population"*: `AMP`
>    - *"Label for second population"*: `TM`
>

>   >  >  
>   >  > Fisher's plot represents the difference between two groups of peptides based on their feature space. Each tiny square in this plot represents the feature space. Based on the sliding window Fisher's test was performed for each feature space to assess the presence of peptides from two different groups on each of the tiny squares.  The AMPs and TMPs in the feature space represented by their mean hydropathy and amino acid volume. Fisher's plot shows that the sequences with larger hydrophobic amino acids are more frequent in TMPs in comparison to AMPs.

### Calculating Sequence Property-Based Descriptors 

In this step we will calculate CTD descriptos. Composition describptors are defined as the number of amino acids of a particular property divided by total number of amino acids.  Transition descriptors are representd as the number of transition from a particular property to different property divided by (total number of amino acids âˆ’ 1). Distribution descriptors are derived by chain length and the amino acids of a particular property are located on this length{% cite Govindan_Nair_2013 %}.

>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Input fasta file"*: `PDAUG TSVtoFASTA on data 1 - first (fasta)` (first output of **PDAUG TSVtoFASTA** {% icon tool %})

>    - *"Descriptor Type"*: `CTD`

### Adding Class labels in both AMPs and TMPs

Usually, class labels are represented by 0 or 1. If data has multi-class classification problems it can be represented by 0,1,2,3, etc. In addition to this, class labels can also be represented by a specific string such as "anticancer" and "non-anticancer" or "treated" and "untreated".

### Merging the two tabular data files 

We utilize **PDAUG Merge Dataframes** to merge two tabular data files.

### Plotting CTD descriptor data as Scatter plot

In this step, we utilize the **PDAUG Basic Plots** tool to compare two libraries based on three CTD descriptors SecondaryStrD1100, SolventAccessibilityD2001, and NormalizedVDWVD3050 respectively. A 3D scatter plot will be generated.
