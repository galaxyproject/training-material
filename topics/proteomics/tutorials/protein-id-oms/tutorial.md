# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

Identifying the proteins contained in a sample is an important step in any proteomic experiment. However, in most settings, proteins are digested to peptides prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. In this so-called "bottom-up" procedure, only peptide masses are measured. Therefore, protein identification cannot be performed directly from raw data, but is a multi-step process:

1. Raw data preparations
2. Peptide-to-Spectrum matching
3. Peptide inference
4. Protein inference

A plethora of different software solutions exists for each step. In this tutorial, we will use ***msconvert*** {% icon tool %}  for raw data conversion and tools from the [OpenMS software suite](https://openms.de) for all other steps. We will use one peptide search engine at first and later on show how to expand the workflow for using multiple search engines. Protein inference will be performed with the Fido algorithm ([Serang et al, JPR, (2010)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20712337)).
This tutorial covers peptide and protein **identification** only, but you may use the output of this tutorial for the [tutorial on protein quantitation]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/proteomics/tutorials/protein-quant-sil/tutorial.html).

For an alternative protein ID workflow using the [Compomics](https://compomics.com/) tools [SearchGUI](https://compomics.github.io/projects/searchgui.html) and [PeptideShaker](https://compomics.github.io/projects/peptide-shaker.html), please consult [this tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/proteomics/tutorials/protein-id-sg-ps/tutorial.html).
The latter tutorial does not allow to continue with the tutorial on protein quantitation.

# Input data
{:.no_toc}

As an example dataset, we will use an LC-MS/MS analysis of HeLa cell lysate published
in [Vaudel et al., 2014, Proteomics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24678044). Detailed information
about the dataset can be found on [PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD000674).
For step 2 we will use a validated human Uniprot FASTA database with appended decoys.

If you already completed the tutorial on [Database Handling]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/proteomics/tutorials/database-handling/tutorial.html)
you can use the constructed database including decoys.
You can find a prepared database, as well as the input LC-MS/MS data in different file formats on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/796184).

# Preparing Raw Data

Raw data conversion is the first step of any proteomic data analysis. The most common converter is MSConvert from the [ProteoWizard software suite](http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/), the format to convert to is mzML.
Due to licensing reasons, MSConvert runs only on windows systems and will not work on most Galaxy servers.

Depending on your machine settings, raw data will be generated either in profile mode or centroid mode. For most peptide search engines, the MS2 data have to be converted to centroid mode, a process called "peak picking" or "centroiding".
Machine vendors offer algorithms to extract peaks from profile raw data. Those are integrated in ***msconvert*** {% icon tool %} and can be run in parallel to the mzML conversion.
However, the OpenMS tool ***PeakPickerHiRes*** {% icon tool %} is reported to generate slightly better results ([Lange et al., 2006, Pac Symp Biocomput](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17094243)) and is therefore recommended for quantitative studies ([Vaudel et al., 2010, Proteomics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19953549)).
If your data were generated on a low resolution mass spectrometer, use **PeakPickerWavelet** {% icon tool %} instead.

# Peptide Identification

MS/MS experiments identify peptides by isolating them and subsequently colliding them with a gas for fragmentation. This method generates a spectrum of peptide fragment masses for each isolated peptide - an MS2 spectrum.
To find out the peptide sequences, the MS2 spectrum is compared to a theoretical spectrum generated from a protein database. This step is called peptide-to-spectrum (also: spectrum-to-sequence) matching. Accordingly, a peptide that is successfully matched to a sequence is termed PSM (Peptide-Spectrum-Match). There can be multiple PSMs per peptide, if the peptide was fragmented several times.

Different peptide search engines have been developed to fulfill the matching procedure. Here, we will use the search engine [X!Tandem](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14976030). OpenMS provides "adapters" (wrappers) for several other peptide search engines, like MSGF+ or OMSSA. You may replace the XTandemAdapter by another search engine of your choice.

# Peptide FDR filtering

The next step of peptide identification is to decide which PSMs will be used for protein inference. Measured MS2 spectra never perfectly fit the theoretical spectra. Therefore, peptide search engines calculate a score which indicates how well the measured MS2 spectrum was fitting the theoretical spectrum. How do we decide which PSMs are likely true and which are false?

In proteomics, this decision is typically done by calculating false discovery rates (FDRs). Remember that the database we were using for peptide-to-spectrum matching consisted not only of true proteins, but also the same number of "fake entries", the so-called decoys. Those decoys can now be used to estimate the number of false identifications in the list of PSMs.
The calculation is based on a simple assumption: for every decoy peptide identified with a given score, we expect one false positive with at least the same score.
The false discovery rate is therefore defined as the number of false discoveries (decoy hits) divided by the number of false and correct discoveries (both target and decoy hits) at a given score threshold.

To calculate FDRs, we first have to annotate the identified peptides to determine which of them are decoys. This is done with the tool **PeptideIndexer** {% icon tool %}. This tool allows the annotation of protein names and calculates the protein coverage based on the identified peptides. Then we calculate peptide posterior error probabilities (PEPs), because they are needed for the protein inference algorithm Fido, which is used by OpenMS. We will then filter PSMs for 1 % FDR with **FalseDiscoveryRate** {% icon tool %}. and set the score back to PEP with **IDScoreSwitcher** {% icon tool %}.

# Protein Inference
In bottom-up proteomics, it is necessary to combine the identified peptides to proteins. This is not a trivial task, as proteins are redundant to some degree. Thus, not every peptide can be assigned to only one protein.
The OpenMS suite implemented the [Fido](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20712337) algorithm for protein inference. Fido uses a Bayesian probabilistic model to group and score proteins based on peptide-spectrum matches. Afterwards, we keep only proteins with 1% FDR.

> ### {% icon comment %} Comment: "Greedy" Group Resolution
> Protein groups are reported, when an identified peptide maps to multiple proteins in the used database [Nesvizhskii and Aebersold (2005)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16009968). Some peptides may map to different protein groups and can therefore not be used for protein quantitation. The option `-greedy_group_resolution` solves this problem by assigning peptides only to the one most probable protein group, thus enabling to quantify proteins based not only on unique, but also on shared peptides. This usually leads to a much higher number of quantified proteins. However it will introduce noise in the FCs when a peptide was indeed shared by different proteins and the quantity of this peptide was a weighted sum of contributions. The greedy group resolution is similar to Occam's razor.

# Analysis of Contaminants

The FASTA database used for the peptide to spectrum matching contained some entries that were not expected to stem from the HeLa cell lysate, but are common contaminations in LC-MS/MS samples. The main reason to add those is to avoid false assignment of contaminant spectra to other proteins.
It also enables you to check for contaminations in your samples.

**CAVE:** When analyzing human samples, many proteins that are common contaminants may also stem from the sample. Therefore, human contaminants do not have to be excluded from further analysis, but you should keep in mind that the source of these proteins is unclear.

Also, eight human proteins are listed, these are commonly introduced during sample preparation. As we were analyzing a human sample, it is not neccessary to remove these proteins, as they may as well originate from the HeLa cells.
> > 2.  Contaminants often stem from the experimenter, these are typically keratins or other high-abundant human proteins.

As an example, sheep keratins are sometimes found in proteomic samples, stemming from clothing made of sheep wool.

# Using multiple search engines

It is generally recommended to use more than one peptide search engine and use the combined results for peptide inference ([Shteynberg et al., 2013, Mol. Cell. Proteomics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23720762)).
By comparing results of multiple search engines, you may improve the *sensitivity* (when accepting peptides that were found by only one of the engines), the *specificity* (when accepting only peptides that were found by all of the search engines) or *both* (when using n>2 search engines and accept peptides found by a fraction of the (e.g. n-1) search engines).

Here, we will use the OpenMS tool [ConsensusID](https://abibuilder.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/Documentation/release/latest/html/TOPP_ConsensusID.html) to combine the search engine results.
