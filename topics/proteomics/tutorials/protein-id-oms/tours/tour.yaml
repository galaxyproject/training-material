  - title: Introduction

      Identifying the proteins contained in a sample is an important step in any
      proteomic experiment. This tour deals with protein identification from
      peptides ("bottom-up proteomics").
    backdrop: true
  - title: Introduction
    content: >-
      Protein identification is a multi-step process:
      <ul>
        <li>Raw data preparations</li>
        <li>Peptide-to-Spectrum matching</li>
        <li>Peptide inference</li>
        <li>Protein inference</li>
      </ul> A plethora of different software solutions exists for each step. In
      this tour, we will use tools from the
      <a href="https://openms.de/">OpenMS software suite</a> for all steps.
      Protein inference will be performed with the Fido algorithm (<a
      href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20712337">Serang et al, JPR,
      (2010)</a>).

  - title: Input data
    content: >-
      As an example dataset, we will use an LC-MS/MS analysis of HeLa cell
      lysate published in <a
      href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24678044">Vaudel et al., 2014,
      Proteomics</a>. Detailed information about the dataset can be found on <a
      href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD000674">PRIDE</a>.<br><br>
      For step 2 we will use a validated human Uniprot FASTA database with
      appended decoys. You can find a prepared database, as well as the input
      proteomics data in different file formats on <a
      href="https://zenodo.org/record/796184">Zenodo</a>.

  - title: Preparing raw data
    content: >-
      Raw data conversion is the first step of any proteomic data analysis. The
      most common converter is MSConvert, the format to convert to is mzML.
      Due to licensing reasons, MSConvert runs only on windows systems and will
      not work on most Galaxy servers. We will omit the data conversion step here
      and start directly with the mzML file format.
    backdrop: true
  - title: Preparing raw data
    content: >-
      Depending on your machine settings, raw data will be generated either in
      profile mode or centroid mode. For most peptide search engines, the MS2
      data have to be converted to centroid mode, a process called “peak
      picking” or “centroiding”. Machine vendors offer algorithms to extract
      peaks from profile raw data. This is implemented in <b>msconvert</b>  and
      can be run in parallel to the mzML conversion. However, the OpenMS tool
      <b>PeakPickerHiRes</b>  is reported to generate slightly better results
      (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17094243">Lange et al.,
      2006, Pac Symp Biocomput</a>).

      The next step of peptide identification is to decide which PSMs will be
      used for protein inference.
      To calculate "false discovery rates" (FDRs), we first have to annotate the identified peptides to
      determine which of them are decoys. This is done with the tool
      <b>PeptideIndexer</b>. Additionally, we will calculate peptide posterior
      error probabilities (PEPs), because they are needed for the protein
      inference algorithm used by OpenMS. We will then filter for 1 % FDR and
      set the score back to PEP.

      In bottom-up proteomics, it is necessary to combine the identified
      peptides to proteins. This is not a trivial task, as proteins are
      redundant to some degree. Thus, not every peptide can be assigned to only
      one protein. The OpenMS suite implemented the <a

      The FASTA database used for the peptide to spectrum matching contained
      some entries that were not expected to stem from the HeLa cell lysate, but
      are common contaminations in LC-MS/MS samples. The main reason to add
      those is to avoid false assignment of contaminant spectra to other proteins.
      It also enables you to check for contaminations in your samples.
      <br><br>
      <b>CAVE</b>: When analyzing human samples, many proteins that are common contaminants may also stem from the sample.
      Therefore, human contaminants do not have to be excluded from further analysis,
