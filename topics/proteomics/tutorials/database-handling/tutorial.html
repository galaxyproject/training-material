                <p>In mass spectrometry based proteomics experiments, peptides are assigned to experimentally acquired tandem mass spectra (MS2) by a method called peptide-spectral matching. Peptide spectral matching is commonly achieved by using search algorithms to match the acquired MS2 spectra to theoretical spectra. The theoretical spectra are generated from an in silico digestion and fragmentation of proteins in the FASTA database. Ideally, the protein FASTA databases will contain all proteins of the organism under investigation.</p>

<p>There are a many ways how you can upload your protein search database (FASTA file with protein sequences). Three of these ways are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using <strong>Protein Database Downloader</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">tool</span> .</li>
  <li>Using a direct weblink to the database.</li>
  <li>Uploading a database from the data library.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this tutorial, we will explore <strong>Protein Database Downloader</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">tool</span> for generating a protein search database. For this we will download the proteome of an organism of interest. In this tutorial, we will use a database of the human proteome.</p>

    <p>Uniprot offers several types of databases. You may choose to download only reviewed (UniProtKB/Swissprot) databases, only unreviewed (UniProtKB/TREMBL) or both (UniProtKB). In model organisms which are well-researched, e.g. <em>Homo sapiens</em> or <em>D. melanogaster</em>, reviewed (Swissprot) databases contain curated proteins and may lead to smaller databases and cleaner search results. However, if the researcher is interested in identifying proteins that are unreviewed, it might be wiser to include the TrEMBL database.</p>

    <p>You may also include protein isoforms by setting the tick box <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Include isoform data</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Yes</code>.</p>

        <li>A UniProt complete proteome consists of the set of proteins thought to be expressed by an organism whose genome has been completely sequenced. A reference proteome is the complete proteome of a representative, well-studied model organism or an organism of interest for biomedical and biotechnological research. Reference proteomes constitute a representative cross-section of the taxonomic diversity to be found within UniProtKB. Species of particular importance may be represented by numerous reference proteomes for specific ecotypes or strains of interest. <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/reference_proteome">Link to source</a></li>

<h1 id="contaminant-databases">Contaminant databases</h1>

<p>In proteomic samples, some protein contaminants are commonly present. These protein contaminants are introduced into the sample during sample preparation, either from contaminated samples (e.g. mycoplasma in cell culture), chemicals or the experimenter in person. In order to avoid misidentification of spectra derived from contaminants, protein sequences of common laboratory contaminants are added to the database. This has two benefits:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The degree of contamination can be observed, heavily contaminated samples can be excluded from analysis.</li>
  <li>Contaminant peptides cannot be misassigned to similar peptides in the database reducing the risk of identifying false positives.</li>
</ol>

<p>A widely used database for common contaminants is the <strong>c</strong>ommon <strong>R</strong>epository of <strong>A</strong>dventitious <strong>P</strong>roteins (cRAP). When using samples generated in cell cultures, it is furthermore recommended to include <em>Mycoplasma</em> proteomes in the search database. <em>Mycoplasma</em> infections are very common in cell culture and often go unnoticed (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3463982/">Drexler and Uphoff, Cytotechnology, 2002</a>).</p>

    <p>The reviewed mycoplasma databases do not contain all known proteins. It is better to also include the TREMBL database. <em>Mycoplasma</em> proteomes are relatively small, so even downloading TrEMBL sequences will not incraese the size of your main database by much.</p>

<h1 id="creating-a-decoy-database">Creating a Decoy Database</h1>

<p>The most common method of peptide and protein False Discovery Rate (FDR) calculation is by adding protein sequences that are not expected to be present in the sample. These are also called decoy protein sequences. This can be done by generating reverse sequences of the target protein entries and appending these protein entries to the protein database. Some search algoritmms use premade target-decoy protein sequences while others can generate a target-decoy protein sequence database from a target protein sequence database before using them for peptide spectral matching.</p>

<h1 id="concluding-remarks">Concluding remarks</h1>

<p>In order to keep your protein databases up-to-date, it is recommended to create a workflow out of the hands-on sections (to learn about workflows see <a href="/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-101/tutorial.html">this tutorial</a>). You might also want to combine the mycoplasma databases to a single file, which you then easily can add to each of your main databases.</p>

<p>Often you may not want to use the most recent database for reasons of reproducibility. If so, you can transfer the final database of this tutorial into other histories to work with it.</p>
