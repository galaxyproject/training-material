    content: >-
      Uniprot offers several types of databases. You may choose to download only reviewed (UniProtKB/Swissprot) databases, only unreviewed (UniProtKB/TREMBL) or both (UniProtKB). In well researched organisms, e.g. Homo sapiens or D. melanogaster, reviewed (Swissprot) databases are always kept up-to-date and may lead to cleaner search results. In other organisms, it might be wiser to include the unreviewed (TREMBL) database not to miss important proteins.
      <br>You may also include protein isoforms by setting the tick box Include isoform data to Yes.

      What is the difference between a “reference proteome set” and a “complete proteome set”?

  - title: Types of uniprot databases
    content: >-
      In proteomic samples, some protein contaminants are very common, stemming from the experimenter or contaminated cell culture. Common contaminants are therefore added to the database. A widely used database for common contaminants is the Common Repository of Adventitious Proteins (cRAP).

      The most common method of peptide and protein FDR calculation is by adding known non-existing proteins, so-called “decoys” to the database. This can be done by reverting or shuffling the real protein entries and adding those fake entries to the database.

      The string you enter as a decoy tag will be added as a prefix or suffix (your choice) to the description of each decoy protein entry. Thus you can see from which entry in the real database the decoy was computed.

    content: |-
      To keep your databases up-to-date, or if you need several databases for different organisms, it would make sense to create a workflow out of the Hands-On section. <br>Often you may not want to use the most recent database for reasons of reproducibility. If so, you can transfer the final database of this tutorial into other histories to work with it.
