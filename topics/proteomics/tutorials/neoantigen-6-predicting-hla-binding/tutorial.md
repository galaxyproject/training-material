Neoantigen prediction for HLA binding is a critical component of personalized cancer immunotherapy. Neoantigens, which are tumor-specific antigens resulting from mutations in cancer cells, can be recognized by the immune system, making them promising targets for tailored immunotherapies. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules play a key role in presenting these neoantigens on the surface of cells, where they can be detected by T-cells, triggering an immune response.

This tutorial focuses on predicting HLA binding affinities for potential neoantigens, an essential step in identifying effective targets for immunotherapy. The workflow includes the use of tools such as OptiType and seq2HLA to determine HLA genotypes, as well as data reformatting and querying methods to manage complex data outputs.

By completing this tutorial, learners will gain an understanding of:

- The bioinformatics approaches required to predict HLA binding,
- Practical skills for neoantigen identification, including managing and analyzing genomic data,
- How to apply specific bioinformatics tools to analyze HLA binding predictions effectively.

This hands-on tutorial is designed to offer practical experience for learners aiming to integrate bioinformatics techniques into their immunotherapy research or clinical practice, emphasizing the theoretical and technical concepts essential for neoantigen prediction.

# Predicting HLA binding
## Overview of HLA Binding Prediction Workflow
This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide for predicting HLA binding of neoantigens, a crucial part of personalized immunotherapy research. Using OptiType and seq2HLA, we will perform HLA typing and analyze which neoantigens are likely to bind to a specific individual’s HLA molecules, potentially driving an immune response. This process is essential for identifying candidate peptides that could serve as effective targets in immunotherapy.

### 1. Get Data
The tutorial begins with the acquisition and upload of necessary sequencing files. These files typically contain raw paired-end reads or other sequencing outputs, which will be processed to identify HLA alleles. Proper organization and tagging of data are crucial for maintaining an efficient workflow.

### 2. HLA Typing with OptiType
OptiType is used first in this tutorial for HLA typing. This tool processes the uploaded sequencing data to identify HLA class I alleles, which are essential for the subsequent neoantigen binding predictions. OptiType’s output will include the predicted HLA alleles that are specific to the individual’s immune profile.

### 3. HLA Typing with seq2HLA
As a complementary approach, we will use seq2HLA for HLA typing to cross-validate results. By comparing predictions from both OptiType and seq2HLA, we can ensure greater accuracy in identifying relevant HLA alleles, allowing us to confidently proceed with neoantigen predictions.

### 4. Reformatting and Filtering HLA Alleles
After obtaining results from both HLA typing tools, the next step is to reformat and filter the data. This involves removing redundant entries and preparing the data in a format that’s optimized for binding prediction. Cleaning and filtering ensure that only the most relevant HLA alleles are used in the neoantigen analysis.

### 5. Querying and Validating HLA Typing Results
The final step is to use SQL-like queries to further refine and validate the HLA typing results. This allows us to filter and focus on the HLA alleles most relevant to our research question, ensuring the quality and relevance of the dataset for predicting neoantigen binding.

This structured workflow enables a streamlined approach for accurate HLA typing and binding prediction, setting the foundation for personalized immunotherapy and advancing the development of effective cancer treatments.

## HLA typing with **OptiType**

OptiType is a bioinformatics tool designed specifically for HLA class I typing using paired-end sequencing reads. In this workflow, OptiType identifies the HLA alleles that a person possesses, which are crucial for understanding which neoantigens may effectively bind to an individual’s immune receptors. This tool enhances the personalization of immunotherapy by providing highly accurate HLA allele predictions. In turn, this allows for more targeted analysis of potential neoantigen binding candidates.

This improves the accuracy of HLA typing, as OptiType can analyze data from both directions of a DNA segment, reducing ambiguity and increasing the chance of correctly identifying HLA alleles.

Setting it to 3 provides multiple possible allele combinations for verification and ensures that we capture the most likely HLA types while still keeping the output manageable for downstream analysis.

## HLA typing with **seq2HLA**

seq2HLA is a computational tool for identifying HLA types from RNA-Seq or DNA-Seq data. It is especially useful in immunogenomics research, as it allows for the prediction of an individual’s HLA class I and II alleles, which play a key role in immune response. In this workflow, seq2HLA provides essential data for identifying potential neoantigens by aligning sequencing reads to reference HLA alleles, allowing researchers to understand the specific immune profile of each sample.

## Reformatting and Filtering HLA Alleles 

This step involves reformatting and filtering the HLA alleles output from the OptiType tool to retain only the relevant and unique alleles. The process is essential for streamlining the data and ensuring that only the significant allele information is passed on for further analysis. Using a simple AWK program, we can filter out redundant data and focus on distinct HLA alleles, which are crucial for downstream neoantigen discovery and immunogenomics applications.

## Querying and Validating HLA Typing Results

In this step, we use the Query Tabular tool to validate and organize the HLA typing results from OptiType and seq2HLA outputs. By querying and filtering the data, we create a consolidated list of HLA alleles, formatted consistently for further analysis. This process ensures that we have a clean dataset of HLA alleles that will improve the accuracy of downstream analyses, such as neoantigen prediction or immune response studies.
