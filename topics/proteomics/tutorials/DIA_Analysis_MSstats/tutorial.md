# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

This training covers the statistical analysis of data independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry (MS) data, after successfull identification and quantification of peptides and proteins. We therefore recommend to first go through the [DIA library generation tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/proteomics/tutorials/DIA_lib_OSW/tutorial.html) as well as the [DIA analysis tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/proteomics/tutorials/DIA_Analysis_OSW/tutorial.html), which teach the principles and characteristics of DIA data analysis. 

Modern mass spectrometry approaches enables the identification and quantification of thousands of proteins and tens of thousands of peptides in single measurements. This provides immense potential to in-depth explorative analysis of a variety of biological samples. However, often the number of available samples is limited leading to large proteomic datasets with only a few numbers of replicates or samples per condition. Thus, the statistical analysis remains challenging in such in-depth proteomic studies. 

Here we will use **MSstats**, which enables the statistical analysis and processing of proteomic data ({% cite Choi2014 %}).

Afterwards, the table is filtered to containg only proteins with valid statistical information (e.g. p-value). Using the log2 Fold change values from all remaining Ecoli proteins we can observe the distribution of log2FC values from the comparison of the two Spike-in conditions.

> 2. How does the distribution of the log2FC values look like? Which Spike-in contained higher amounts of Ecoli and is it possible to see how much more Ecoli was spiked-in?
>
> > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
> >
> > 1. In total, over 800 Ecoli proteins were identified from which 500 have a p-value for the comparison of the two Spike-in conditions.
> > 2. We can see a gaussian distribution of the log2FC values around a positive value of 3. Since we compared Spike_in_2 / Spike_in_1 we can directly see that Spike_in_2 contained higher amounts of Ecoli. Furthermore, since the apex of the distribution is around 3 and we compared log2 intensities, we could estimate that Spike_in_2 contained approx. 8-times more Ecoli than Spike_in_1.

The conversion of the **PyProphet export** output can either be done using **MSstats** (as we did above), or during the **Pyprophet export** step by using another R package called swath2stats ({% cite Blattmann2016 %}). Prior to the conversion the data can be processed and filtered using the swath2stats functionalities.

> > 2. Generally, the two log2FC distribution look very similar, showing a gaussian distribution of the log2FC values around a positive value of 3. There seems to be a slight difference of the apex of the distribution, in the first **MSstats** analysis it seems to be higher than 3, whereas in the second **MSstats** analysis the apex seems to be lower than 3.

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

![DIA_MSstats_pipe](../../images/DIA_MSstats_sum.png "All-in one workflow for DIA analysis in Galaxy. The statistical analysis using MSstats is highlighted in green.")

Using **MSstats** we were able to identify and quantify differentially regulated proteins between two Spike-in conditions in a HEK/Ecoli Benchmark DIA datatset. Furthermore, the preprocessing of the proteomic data prior to the statistical analysis can directly impact results. Thus, it might be beneficial to try various ways of intermediate data processing and statistical analysis to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the investigation.
