Galaxy has a tool named Sixgill that can be used to convert the nucleic acid sequences to ‘metapeptide’ sequences. There are other options available within Galaxy such as the GalaxyGraph approach and Metagenome Binning, Assembly and Annotation Workflow. Please [contact us](https://help.galaxyproject.org/), if you need assistance.
