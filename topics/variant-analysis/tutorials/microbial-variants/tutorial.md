# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

Variant calling is the process of identifying differences between two genome samples. Usually differences are limited to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions and deletions (indels). Larger structural variation such as inversions, duplications and large deletions are not typically covered by “variant calling”.

Imagine that you have been asked to find the differences between a sample that has been sequenced and a known genome. For example: You have a new sample from a patient and you want to see if it has any differences from a well known reference genome of the same species. Typically, you would have a couple of fastq read files sent back to you from the sequencing provider and either an annotated or non annotated reference genome.

In this tutorial, we will use the tool “Snippy” (link to Snippy is [here](https://github.com/tseemann/snippy)) to find high confidence differences (indels or SNPs) between our known genome and our reads. Snippy uses one tool to align the reads to the reference genome, and another tool to decide (“call”) if any of the resulting discrepancies are real variants or technical artifacts that can be ignored. Finally, Snippy uses another tool to check what effect these differences have on the predicted genes - truncation, frame shift or if the changes are synonomous.

For the read alignment (read mapping) step, Snippy uses BWA MEM with a custom set of settings which are very suitable to aligning reads for microbial type data. For the variant calling step, Smippy uses Freebayes with a custom set of settings. snpeff is then used to describe what the predicted changes do in terms of the genes themselves.

The Galaxy wrapper for Snippy has the ability to change some of the underlying tool settings in the advanced section but it is not recommended.

# Get the data

The data for today is a subset of a real dataset from a Staphylococcus aureus bacteria.
We have a closed genome sequence and an annotation for our "wildtype" strain.
We have used a whole genome shotgun approach to produce a set of short sequence reads on an Illumina DNA sequencing instrument for our mutant strain.

- The reads are paired-end
- Each read is on average 150 bases
- The reads would cover the original wildtype genome to a depth of 19x

The files we will be using are:

- `mutant_R1.fastq` & `mutant_R2.fastq` - the read files in fastq format.
- `wildtype.fna` - The sequence of the reference strain in fasta format.
- `wildtype.gbk` - The reference strain with gene and other annotations in genbank format.
- `wildtype.gff` - The reference strain with gene and other annotations in gff3 format.

This data is available at Zenodo using the following [link](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.582600).

# Find variants with Snippy

We will now run the Snippy tool on our reads, comparing it to the reference. 

Snippy is a tool for rapid bacterial SNP calling and core genome alignments. Snippy finds SNPs between a haploid reference genome and your NGS sequence reads. It will find both substitutions (snps) and insertions/deletions (indels).

If we give Snippy an annotated reference, it will silently run a tool called SnpEff which will figure out the effect of any changes on the genes and other features. If we just give Snippy the reference sequence alone without the annotations, it will not run SnpEff.

We have an annotated reference and so will use it in this case.

# Examine Snippy output

Snippy has taken the reads, mapped them against the reference using BWA MEM, looked through the resulting BAM file and found differences using some fancy Bayesian statistics (Freebayes), filtered the differences for sensibility and finally checked what effect these differences will have on the predicted genes and other features in the genome.

It produces quite a bit of output, there can be up to 10 output files.

Filename | Description
--- | ---
snps vcf file | The final annotated variants in VCF format
snps gff file | The variants in GFF3 format
snps table | A simple tab-separated summary of all the variants
snps summary  | A summary of the SNPs called
log file  | A log file with the commands run and their outputs
aligned fasta | A version of the reference but with - at position with depth=0 and N for 0 < depth < --mincov **(does not have variants)**
consensus fasta | A version of the reference genome with all variants instantiated
mapping depth | A table of the mapping depth
mapped reads bam  | A BAM file containing all of the mapped reads
outdir  | A tarball of the Snippy output directory for inout into Snippy-core if required

We will now have a look at the contents of the SNP table file (`snippy on data XX, data XX and data XX table`):

# View Snippy output in JBrowse

We could go through all of the variants like this and read them out of a text table, but this is onerous and doesn't really give the context of the changes very well. It would be much nicer to have a visualisation of the SNPs and the other relevant data. In Galaxy we can use a tool called JBrowse.

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

By running a tool such as Snippy on your read files and reference genome, we can find where the biologically important changes between genomes of different strains occur and perhaps what they mean to the phenotype.
