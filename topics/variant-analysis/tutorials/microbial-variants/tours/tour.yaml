      In this tutorial, we will use the tool “Snippy” (link to Snippy is <a
      href="https://github.com/tseemann/snippy">here</a>) to find high
      confidence differences (indels or SNPs) between our known genome and our
      reads.

  - title: Introduction
    content: >-
      Variant calling is the process of identifying differences between two
      genome samples. Usually differences are limited to single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions and deletions (indels). Larger
      structural variation such as inversions, duplications and large deletions
      are not typically covered by “variant calling”. <br><br>Imagine that you
      have been asked to find the differences between a sample that has been
      sequenced and a known genome. For example: You have a new sample from a
      patient and you want to see if it has any differences from a well known
      reference genome of the same species. Typically, you would have a couple
      of fastq read files sent back to you from the sequencing provider and
      either an annotated or non annotated reference genome.

      In this tutorial, we will use the tool “Snippy” (link to Snippy is <a
      href="https://github.com/tseemann/snippy">Snippy</a>)
      to find high confidence differences (indels or SNPs) between our known
      genome and our reads. Snippy uses one tool to align the reads to the
      reference genome, and another tool to decide (“call”) if any of the
      resulting discrepancies are real variants or technical artifacts that can
      be ignored. Finally, Snippy uses another tool to check what effect these
      differences have on the predicted genes - truncation, frame shift or if
      the changes are synonomous.
    backdrop: true
  - title: Introduction
    content: >-
      For the read alignment (read mapping) step, Snippy uses BWA MEM with a
      custom set of settings which are very suitable to aligning reads for
      microbial type data. For the variant calling step, Snippy uses Freebayes
      with a custom set of settings. snpeff is then used to describe what the
      predicted changes do in terms of the genes themselves. <br><br>The Galaxy
      wrapper for Snippy has the ability to change some of the underlying tool
      settings in the advanced section but it is not recommended.

      The data for today is a subset of a real dataset from a Staphylococcus
      aureus bacteria. We have a closed genome sequence and an annotation for
      our “wildtype” strain. We have used a whole genome shotgun approach to
      produce a set of short sequence reads on an Illumina DNA sequencing
      instrument for our mutant strain.<ul>
        <li>The reads are paired-end</li>
        <li>Each read is on average 150 bases</li>
        <li>The reads would cover the original wildtype genome to a depth of 19x</li></ul>

    content: >-
      We will now run the Snippy tool on our reads, comparing it to the
      reference.<br><br>

      Snippy is a tool for rapid bacterial SNP calling and core genome
      alignments. Snippy finds SNPs between a haploid reference genome and your
      NGS sequence reads. It will find both substitutions (snps) and
      insertions/deletions (indels).<br><br>

      If we give Snippy an annotated reference, it will silently run a tool
      called SnpEff which will figure out the effect of any changes on the genes
      and other features. If we just give Snippy the reference sequence alone
      without the annotations, it will not run SnpEff.<br><br>

      We have an annotated reference and so will use it in this case.

      Snippy has taken the reads, mapped them against the reference using BWA

      sensibility and finally checked what effect these differences will have on
      the predicted genes and other features in the genome.

      We could go through all of the variants like this and read them out of a
      text table, but this is onerous and doesn’t really give the context of the
      changes very well. It would be much nicer to have a visualisation of the
      SNPs and the other relevant data. In Galaxy we can use a tool called
      JBrowse.

      we can find where the biologically important changes between genomes of
      different strains occur and perhaps what they mean to the phenotype.
