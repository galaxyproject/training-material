<h1 class="no_toc" id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Variant calling is a complex field that was significantly propelled by advances in DNA sequencing and efforts of large scientific consortia such as the <a href="http://www.1000genomes.org">1000 Genomes</a>. Here we summarize basic ideas central to Genotype and Variant calling. First, let’s contrast the two things although they often go together:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Variant calling</strong> - identification of positions where the sequenced sample is different from the reference sequence (or <a href="https://github.com/vgteam/vg">reference genome graph</a>);</li>
  <li>
<strong>Genotype calling</strong> - identifying individual’s genotype at variable sites.</li>
</ul>

<p>A typical workflow for variation discovery involves the following steps (e.g., see Nielsen et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3593722/">2011</a>):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Mapping reads against the reference genome;</li>
  <li>Thresholding BAM datasets by, for example, retaining paired, properly mapped reads;</li>
  <li>Performing quality score recalibration;</li>
  <li>Performing realignment;</li>
  <li>Performing variant calling/genotype assignment;</li>
  <li>Performing filtering and genotype quality score recalibration;</li>
  <li>Annotating variants and performing downstream analyses.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, continuing evolution of variant detection methods has made some of these steps obsolete. For instance, omitting quality score recalibration and re-alignment (steps 3 and 4 above) when using haplotype-aware variant callers such as <a href="https://github.com/ekg/freebayes">FreeBayes</a> does not have an effect on the resulting calls (see Brad Chapman’s methodological comparisons at <a href="https://bit.ly/1S9kFJN">bcbio</a></p>

<h1 id="how-does-snp-calling-and-genotyping-work">How does SNP calling and genotyping work?</h1>

<p>Before going forward with an actual genotype calling in Galaxy let’s take a look as some basic ideas behind modern variant callers.</p>

<h3 id="snp-calling-and-genotyping-examples">SNP calling and genotyping examples:</h3>

<p>Consider a set of sequencing reads derived from a diploid individual:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>REFERENCE: atcatgacggcaGtagcatat
--------------------------------
READ1:     atcatgacggcaGtagcatat
READ2:         tgacggcaGtagcatat
READ3:     atcatgacggcaAtagca
READ4:            cggcaGtagcatat
READ5:     atcatgacggcaGtagc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The capitalized position contains a G-&gt;A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics)">transition</a>. So, in principle this can be a heterozygous site with two alleles <strong>G</strong> and <strong>A</strong>. A commonly used naïve procedure would define a site as <em>heterozygous</em> if there is a non-reference allele with frequency between 20% and 80%. In this case <strong>A</strong> is present in 1/5 or 20% of the cases, so we can say that this is a heterozygous site. Yet it is only represented by a single read and is hardly reliable. Here are some of the possibilities that would explain this <em>variant</em>. It can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A true variant;</li>
  <li>A library preparation artifact (e.g., a PCR error);</li>
  <li>A base call error;</li>
  <li>A misalignment (though unlikely in the above example).</li>
</ul>

<p>The modern variant callers attempt to assign a reliability estimate for each genotype call. This is done using Bayes reasoning.</p>

<p>Suppose you have <strong>A</strong> samples with a variant in a population. You are performing re-sequencing and observe a variant in <strong>B</strong> of your sequencing reads.

  <ol>
    <li>What is the probability of a having a real polymorphism <strong>A</strong> given our observation of variants in reads <strong>B</strong>? In other words what is the probability of A given <strong>B</strong>? Or, as stated in the original <a href="https://oscarbonilla.com/2009/05/visualizing-bayes-theorem/">blog</a>: “given that we are in region <strong>B</strong> what is the probability that we are in the region <strong>AB</strong>?”</li>
    <li>
      <p>Now, let’s ask an opposite question. Given a true polymorphism <strong>A</strong> what are the chances that we do detect it (i.e., find ourselves in <strong>AB</strong>)?</p>

      <details>
<summary>Click to view answer</summary>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>P(A|B) = |AB|/|B|.</p>
<p>Dividing by |U|: P(A|B) = (|AB|/|U|)/(|B|/|U|).</p>
<p>Because we know that P(AB) = |AB|/|U| and P(B) = |B|/|U|, we can rewrite the equation in the previous bullet point as P(A|B) = P(AB)/P(B)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will be P(B|A) = P(AB)/P(A).</p>
<p>So, because we know that P(A|B) = P(AB)/P(B) and we just reasoned that P(B|A) = P(AB)/P(A), we can say that P(A|B)P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) leading us to the Bayes formula P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B).</p>
<p>Translating this into "genomics terms" the probability of having a genotype G given reads R is:  P(G|R) = P(R|G)P(G)/P(R). Because in a given calculation of P(G|R) reads are fixed we can re-write the Bayes formula in the following way P(G|R) ~ P(R|G)P(G) with P(R) becoming a constant.</p>

<p>In the simplest case we can estimate these as follows:</p>

<h4 id="prg"><em>P(R|G)</em></h4>

    <tr>

      <td>G)* is the product of *P(R<sub>i</sub>
</td>
      <td>G)* over all <em>i</em>.

<h4 id="pg---a-single-sample-case">
<em>P(G)</em> - a single sample case</h4>

<p>One can assign an equal probability to all possible genotypes, or to source this information based on previously obtained knowledge containing in a database, such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/">dbSNP</a>. In this case (as exemplified in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3593722/">Nielsen et al.</a> we may, for instance, have a site with a <strong>G/T</strong> polymorphism and genotypes <strong>GG</strong>, <strong>TT</strong>, and <strong>GT</strong> having frequencies of 0.45, 0.45, 0.09, respectively. We will use these values as priors.</p>

<h4 id="pg---a-multi-sample-case">
<em>P(G)</em> - a multi-sample case</h4>

<p>Genotype calling reliability can be significantly improved when analyzing multiple samples jointly. In this case genotype frequencies can be inferred from allele frequencies using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%E2%80%93Weinberg_principle">HWE</a>). The following example (again from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3593722/">Nielsen et al.</a>) illustrates this idea: suppose you are calling genotypes for a single individual using a combination of multiple samples. There are two genotypes, <strong>AT</strong> and <strong>AA</strong>, with equally large genotype likelihoods. If, however, in our collection of multiple samples the frequency of <strong>A</strong> is 1% (<em>p</em> = 0.01; <em>q</em> = 1 - <em>p</em> = 0.99), then from the HWE we have:</p>

    <tr>
      <th>AA (<em>p<sup>2</sup></em>)</th>
      <th>AT (2<em>pq</em>)</th>
      <th>TT (<em>q<sup>2</sup></em>)</th>

<h1 id="calling-with-freebayes">Calling with FreeBayes</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ekg/freebayes">FreeBayes</a> is an open source variant caller that has been battle tested by the 1000 Genomes community and is extensively used today (also see <a href="https://bcbio.wordpress.com/">bcbio</a>). It has a number of features that simply variant discovery workflows. These include (from FreeBayes github page):</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
<strong>Indel realignment is accomplished internally</strong> using a read-independent method, and issues resulting from discordant alignments are dramatically reducedy through the direct detection of haplotypes;</li>
    <li>
<strong>The need for base quality recalibration is avoided</strong> through the direct detection of haplotypes. Sequencing platform errors tend to cluster (e.g. at the ends of reads), and generate unique, non-repeating haplotypes at a given locus;</li>
    <li>
<strong>Variant quality recalibration is avoided</strong> by incorporating a number of metrics, such as read placement bias and allele balance, directly into the Bayesian model;</li>
    <li>
<strong>Ability to incorporate non-diploid cases</strong> such as pooled datasets or data from polyploid samples.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Freebayes is a <em>haplotype-based</em> variant caller. This implies that instead of looking at an individual positions within an alignment of reads to the reference genome, it looks at a haplotype window, length of which is dynamically determined (see section 3.2. in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.3907v2.pdf">FreeBayes manuscript</a>):</p>

<h1 id="lets-try-it">Let’s try it</h1>

<h2 id="the-data">The data</h2>

<p>In this example we will perform variant calling and annotation using <a href="https://sites.stanford.edu/abms/content/giab-reference-materials-and-data">genome in the bottle data</a>. Specifically, we will use Ashkenazim Father-Mother-Son trio data from the Personal Genome Project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HG002- NA24385 - huAA53E0 (son)</li>
  <li>HG003- NA24149 - hu6E4515 (father)</li>
  <li>HG004- NA24143 - hu8E87A9 (mother)</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet for a quick tutorial these datasets are way too big, so we created a <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.60520">downsampled dataset</a>. This dataset was produced by mapping the trio reads against <code class="highlighter-rouge">hg19</code> version of the human genome, merging the resulting bam files together (we use readgroups to label individual reads so they can be traced to each of the original individuals), and restricting alignments to a small portion of chromosome 19 containing the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=Graphics&amp;list_uids=5442"><em>POLRMT</em></a> gene.</p>

<p>This produces a dataset in <a href="http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/Analysis/variant-call-format">VCF</a> format containing 35 putative variants.

<p>At this point we are ready to begin annotating variants using <a href="http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/SnpEff.html"><strong>SnpEff</strong></a>. <strong>SnpEff</strong>, a project maintained by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pablocingolani">Pablo Cingolani</a> “<em>…annotates and predicts the effects of variants on genes (such as amino acid changes)…</em>” and so is critical for functional interpretation of variation data.</p>

<h2 id="manipulating-variation-data-with-gemini">Manipulating variation data with GEMINI</h2>

<p>Now that we have an annotated VCF file it is time to peek inside our variation data. <a href="http://quinlanlab.org/">Aaron Quinlan</a>, creator of <a href="http://gemini.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">GEMINI</a>, calls it <em>Detective work</em>.</p>

<h3 id="loading-data-into-gemini">Loading data into GEMINI</h3>

<p>The first step is to convert a VCF file we would like to analyze into a GEMINI database. For this we will use <strong>GEMINI Load</strong> tool from <strong>Gemini</strong> section. GEMINI takes as input a VCF file and a <a href="https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/formats#ped">PED</a> file describing the relationship between samples. In the case of our dataset the PED file looks like this (second imported file):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#family_id sample_id            paternal_id          maternal_id         sex phenotype ethnicity

  <p>So let’s load data into GEMINI by setting VCF and PED inputs</p>

  <p><img src="../../images/gemini_load.png" alt="GEMINI load parameters"></p>

  <p>This creates a sqlite database. To see the content of the database use <strong>GEMINI_db_info</strong>:</p>

<p>This produce a list of all tables and fields in the database.</p>

<h3 id="querying-gemini-database">Querying GEMINI database</h3>

<p>GEMINI database is queried using the versatile SQL language (more on SQL <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey">here</a>). In Galaxy’s version of GEMINI this is done using <strong>GEMINI_query</strong> tool. Within this tool SQL commands are typed directly into the <strong>The query to be issued to the database</strong> text box. Let’s begin getting information from some of the tables we discovered with <strong>GEMINI_db_info</strong> tool above.</p>
