                <p>In order to map and identify phenotype-causing mutations efficiently from a
single experiment, modern genetic research aims to combine classical genetic
mapping concepts with the power of next-generation-sequencing.</p>

<p>For example, after having obtained a mutant strain of an organism with a particular phenotype from a forward genetic screen, the classical approach towards
identification of the underlying causative mutation would be to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>perform mapping crosses to probe for linkage between the unknown mutation
and selected markers with known location on the genome, in order to determine
the approximate genomic region that the mutation resides in, then</li>
  <li>sequence candidate DNA stretches in this region to identify the precise
nature of the mutation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Modern approaches, in contrast, use just one set of genome-wide sequencing data
obtained from mapping-cross progeny and suitable parent strains to
simultaneously:</p>

<ul>
  <li>discover available marker mutations for linkage analysis,</li>
  <li>map the causative mutation using these markers, and</li>
  <li>identify candidate mutations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since it uses sequencing data already at the mapping step, this process is
called <strong>mapping-by-sequencing</strong>.</p>

<p>Since genome-wide sequencing will often reveal a few hundreds to many thousands
of marker variants that should be considered together in the linkage analysis,
mapping-by-sequencing data is typically analyzed with dedicated computational
tools. For Galaxy, the <strong>MiModD</strong> suite of tools offers efficient and flexible
analysis workflows compatible with a variety of mapping-by-sequencing
approaches.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we are going to use several of these tools to map and identify
a point mutation in an <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> strain from whole-genome
sequencing data. This will demonstrate one particular kind of linkage analysis
supported by <strong>MiModD</strong> called <em>Variant Allele Frequency Mapping</em>.</p>

<h3 id="variant-allele-frequency-mapping">Variant Allele Frequency Mapping</h3>

<figure id="figure-1" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/mbs_scheme.png" alt="Principal of variant allele frequency mapping. " width="972" height="1121" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/mbs_scheme.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> Principle of variant allele frequency mapping</figcaption></figure>

<p>As illustrated in Figure 1, variant allele frequency mapping analyzes marker
variant inheritance patterns in pooled F2 recombinants selected for the
mutation to be mapped.</p>

<p>In the figure we assume a diploid
organism with just two pairs (dark and light grey) of chromosomes.</p>

<p>A mutant line established for any organism will harbor
two types of variants (diamonds):</p>
<ul>
  <li>variants induced during mutagenesis (orange), among them the causative
variant responsible for the mutant phenotype (yellow)</li>
  <li>variants (with respect to the species’ reference genome) that were
present in the premutagenesis strain (green open diamonds)</li>
</ul>

<p>For mapping the causative mutation, additional variants (blue open diamonds)
are introduced through a cross to a mapping strain and F2 progeny is selected
for the mutant phenotype. While each individual in the F2 generation carries
its uniquely recombined variant pattern (3 possible outcomes for the diploid
genome are shown in the figure), this phenotypic selection will work against
mapping strain variants in the vicinity (yellow boxes) of the causative
variant. Hence, when the recombined DNA from phenotypic F2 progeny gets pooled
and sequenced, the causative variant can be found by looking for a region for
which all sequenced reads support variant alleles found in the original mutant
line, rather than mapping strain variant alleles.</p>

<h1 id="data-preparation">Data Preparation</h1>

<p>In this tutorial we are going to (re-)identify the recessive causative mutation
in a late-flowering mutant line of <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em>.</p>

<blockquote class="comment">
  <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment</div>
  <p><strong>MiModD</strong> was developed as a successor of the older and now unmaintained
<em>CloudMap</em> suite of tools, but also uses some key concepts first implemented
in the command line package <em>SHOREmap</em>.
The data used in this tutorial represent a subsample of the
<a href="http://bioinfo.mpipz.mpg.de/shoremap/examples.html">SHOREmap proof-of-principle data</a>
(specifically of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OCF2</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ler</code> datasets).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mutant line was obtained from a mutagenesis screen on the <strong>Col</strong>umbia
reference background of <em>A. thaliana</em>. For mapping-by-sequencing, the line was
outcrossed to the highly polymorphic <strong>L</strong>andsberg <em><strong>er</strong>ecta</em> background as a
source of marker variants. From this outcross, 119 F2 siblings showing the
original late-flowering phenotype were recovered and their genomic DNA was
pooled and subjected to whole-genome sequencing.
Together with whole-genome sequencing data of a pure L<em>er</em> background strain,
this outcrossed pool data forms the starting point of our analysis.
The L<em>er</em> strain sample, thus, can inform us about the markers that the
outcrossed F2 pool <em>could</em> have inherited and exclusion of L<em>er</em> markers from
a particular genomic region from the F2 pool provides evidence that the
phenotype causing variant lies close to this region. With respect to
<a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>, this means that we will only use “blue diamond” marker
variants introduced through the mapping cross for the linkage analysis and
ignore potentially informative (green and orange) variants found in the
original mutant line.</p>

<p>For your convenience, the sequenced reads from both datasets have already been
mapped (using <strong>Bowtie2</strong>) to the <em>A. thaliana</em> Col reference genome (version
TAIR10) so the two datasets take the form of BAM files with the mapping results
(see the tutorial on
<a href="../../../sequence-analysis/tutorials/mapping/tutorial.html">NGS data mapping</a>

<h1 id="joint-variant-calling-and-extraction">Joint Variant Calling and Extraction</h1>

<p>A hallmark of all mapping-by-sequencing analyses is that one would like to
follow the fate of variants through genetic crosses. In this tutorial, for
example, we would like to determine, for every marker variant provided by the
L<em>er</em> background, at what frequency it got inherited by the outcrossed F2 pool.
For such analyses to work reliably, it is best to call variants jointly for all
relevant samples because this allows the variant caller to give us per-sample
variant call statistics for all sites at which <strong>any</strong> sample is found to have
a non-wt genotype. In our case, this means that the variant caller will report
any variants it finds for the L<em>er</em> background sample along with the call
statistics for the outcrossed F2 pool at that same site - even if the variant
allele contributes very little to the pool and would, thus, have been
disregarded in a standard single-sample analysis.</p>

<p>Here, we are using the <strong>MiModD Variant Calling</strong> tool for joint variant
calling for our two samples. This tool outputs variant call statistics across
all sites and all samples in the compact binary BCF format. We can then use
the <strong>MiModD Extract Variant Sites</strong> tool to extract sites, for which at least
one sample appears to have a non-wt genotype, and report them in VCF format.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>You can click on the extracted variants dataset in your history to
get more details about it. You should see that the file has an
estimated 130,000 lines. Since one variant gets reported per line in VCF format (apart from a number
of header lines), this roughly
equals the number of variants in the dataset.</li>
        <li>
          <p>The huge number of variants reflects the fact that the L<em>er</em>
mapping strain is really quite diverged from the Col reference
background that the mutant was generated in and, thus, offers many
marker variants for mapping.</p>

          <p>In total, the L<em>er</em> genome harbors &gt;400,000 single nucleotide
variants compared to the Col reference, but to keep the tutorial
datasets small we only provided reads mapping to 2 out of 5
chromosomes. In addition, we provided really low-coverage data
even for those two chromosomes so our analysis will miss many true
variants and contain many questionable variant calls that may represent
false-positives. Regardless, an analysis based on such a large overall number
of variants is robust enough to provide useful results.</p>

<h1 id="linkage-analysis">Linkage Analysis</h1>

<p>The extracted variants dataset obtained in the previous step contains
information about thousands of sites that can be used as markers to map the
causative mutation in the F2 pool. We will now analyze the data with the
<strong>MiModD NacreousMap</strong> tool in <strong>Variant Allele Frequency</strong> mapping mode to
identify these markers and look for linkage between them and the causative

      <p>With these settings, we base the linkage analysis on crossed-in variants
only, <em>i.e.</em>, the tool will look for variants, for which the L<em>er</em> sample

        <li>The plots suggest that the causative variant is likely to be found
in the region from 18,000,000 to 19,000,000 on chr2.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Look at the y axis labels! The scatter plots show the rates at
which marker sites appear to recombine with the causative mutation
in the pool of F2 recombinants, while the histograms show linkage
evidence. Hence, a dip of the scatter plot regression line towards zero
corresponds to a peak in the histograms and the two kinds of plots are,
thus, in very good agreement for this analysis.</p>

          <p>In general, the histogram plots are easier to digest and often
provide more precise mapping intervals, and are often all you need for
mapping a causative variant. The per-marker scatter plots, on the other
hand, are closer to the raw data and can sometimes reveal additional
irregularities in the data that may indicate problems with the mapping
cross or unexpected factors influencing the inheritance pattern.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Since we included only reads mapping to chromosome 1 or 2 in
the original BAM files, the tool will not be able to detect any markers
for the other chromosomes.</li>

<h1 id="identifying-candidate-mutations">Identifying Candidate Mutations</h1>

<p>With the mapping results obtained above we can now try to get a list of
candidates for the causative mutation. Here is what we know about this mutation
so far:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The F2 recombinant pool should appear homozygous mutant for it.</p>

    <p>This is because the F2 recombinants got selected based on the phenotype of
the recessive mutation so we can assume that all individuals in the pool were
homozygous for it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The L<em>er</em> strain should not carry it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should reside in the genomic region identified in the previous step.</p>

        <li>If you used the suggested mapping interval of 1Mb on chr2, you
should have retained 5 variants. Filtering is a really powerful way to
reduce the number of variants to consider!</li>
        <li>Re-running the job with the region filter removed shows that across
the two chromosomes, for which the input datasets provided sequencing
reads, there are 50 variants for which the pool appears homozygous
mutant and for which the L<em>er</em> strain is homozygous wt.</li>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Not all of the retained variants are equally likely candidates for being the
causative mutation. Since the input datasets consist of reads from whole-genome
sequencing, as opposed to exome sequencing, some of the variants may fall in
intergenic regions or introns where they are unlikely to cause a phenotype.
Other variants may fall in coding regions, but may be silent on the protein
level. Hence, we can prioritize our candidate variants after annotating them
with predicted functional effects.</p>

        <li>The C→T transition at 18,774,111 results in a premature
translational stop for the transcript AT2G45550.1. The C→T transition
at 18,808,927 affects a splice donor site and, thus, is likely to
interfere with correct splicing of the transcript AT2G45660.1.</li>
        <li>From the linked gene pages at <em>TAIR</em> you can learn that the
gene AT2G45550 encodes a cytochrome P450, while AT2G45660 encodes a
protein called AGL20/SOC1, which is known to control flowering. Thus, there
is a direct connection between the late-flowering phenotype of the
mutant line studied here and the known role of the gene affected by
chr2:18,808,927 C→T.</li>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Mapping-by-sequencing can greatly speed up and facilitate the molecular
identification of mutations recovered from mutagenesis screens. The method
makes extensive use of cross-sample comparison of variants and benefits strongly
from joint variant calling to generate reliable and manageable variant
information. A combination of variant linkage analysis and filtering often
results in very small lists of candidate variants that can then be confirmed
through further experimental work. Importantly, the selection of biological
samples for sequencing determines the meaningful variant comparisons that can
be made in the bioinformatics analysis so it is important to understand the
essence of the analysis method <strong>before</strong> the preparation of any biological
samples.</p>
