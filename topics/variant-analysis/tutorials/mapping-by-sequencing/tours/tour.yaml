    content: >-
      In order to map and identify phenotype-causing mutations efficiently from
      a single experiment, modern genetic research aims at combining classical
      genetic mapping concepts with the power of next-generation-sequencing.<br>
      <br>After having obtained, e.g., from a forward genetic screen, a mutant
      strain of an organism with a particular phenotype, the classical approach
      towards identification of the underlying causative mutation would be
      to<ul>
        <li>perform mapping crosses to probe for linkage between the unknown mutation and selected markers with known location on the genome in order to determine the approximate genomic region that the mutation resides in, then</li>
        <li>sequence candidate DNA stretches in this region to identify the precise nature of the mutation.</li></ul>
    backdrop: true
  - title: Introduction
    content: >-
      Modern approaches, in contrast, use just one set of genome-wide sequencing
      data obtained from mapping-cross progeny and suitable parent strains to
      simultaneously<ul>
        <li>discover available marker mutations for linkage analysis,</li>
        <li>map the causative mutation using these markers, and</li>
        <li>identify candidate mutations.</li></ul>
      <br>Since it uses sequencing data already at the mapping step, this
      process is called <b>mapping-by-sequencing</b>.<br> Since genome-wide
      sequencing will often reveal a few hundreds to many thousands of marker
      variants that should be considered together in the linkage analysis,
      mapping-by-sequencing data is typically analyzed with dedicated
      computational tools. For Galaxy, the <b>MiModD</b> suite of tools offers
      efficient and flexible analysis workflows compatible with a variety of
      mapping-by-sequencing approaches.

      In this tutorial we are going to use several of these tools to map and
      identify a point mutation in an <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> strain from
      whole-genome sequencing data. This will demonstrate one particular kind of
      linkage analysis supported by <b>MiModD</b> called <i>Variant Allele
      Frequency Mapping</i>.
    backdrop: true
  - title: Variant Allele Frequency Mapping
    content: >-
      Variant allele frequency mapping analyzes marker variant inheritance
      patterns in pooled F2 recombinants selected for the mutation to be
      mapped.<br> For mapping the causative mutation, additional variants are
      introduced through a cross to a mapping strain and F2 progeny is selected
      for the mutant phenotype. While each individuum in the F2 generation
      carries its uniquely recombined variant pattern, this phenotypic selection
      will work against mapping strain variants in the vicinity of the causative
      variant. Hence, when the recombined DNA from phenotypic F2 progeny gets
      pooled and sequenced, the causative variant can be found by looking for a
      region for which all sequenced reads support variant alleles found in the
      original mutant line, rather than mapping strain variant alleles.

      In this tutorial we are going to (re-)identify the recessive causative
      mutation in a late-flowering mutant line of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.
      <br>For your convenience, the sequenced reads from both datasets have
      already been mapped (using <b>Bowtie2</b>) to the <i>A. thaliana Col</i>
      reference genome (version TAIR10) so the two datasets take the form of BAM
      files with the mapping results (see the tutorial on <a

  - title: Joint Variant Calling and Extraction
    content: >-
      A hallmark of all mapping-by-sequencing analyses is that one would like to
      follow the fate of variants through genetic crosses. In this tutorial, for
      example, we would like to determine, for every marker variant provided by
      the Ler background, at what frequency it got inherited by the outcrossed
      F2 pool. For such analyses to work reliably, it is best to call variants
      jointly for all relevant samples because this allows the variant caller to
      give us per-sample variant call statistics for all sites at which any
      sample is found to have a non-wt genotype. In our case, this means that
      the variant caller will report any variants it finds for the Ler
      background sample along with the call statistics for the outcrossed F2
      pool at that same site - even if the variant allele contributes very
      little to the pool and would, thus, have been disregarded in a standard
      single-sample analysis. <br><br>Here, we are using the <b>MiModD Variant
      Calling</b> tool for joint variant calling for our two samples. This tool
      outputs variant call statistics across all sites and all samples in the
      compact binary BCF format. We can then use the <b>MiModD Extract Variant
      Sites</b> tool to extract sites, for which at least one sample appears to
      have a non-wt genotype, and report them in VCF format.

      Not all of the retained variants are equally likely candidates for being
      the causative mutation. Since the input datasets consist of reads from
      whole-genome sequencing, as opposed to exome sequencing, some of the
      variants may fall in intergenic regions or introns where they are unlikely
      to cause a phenotype. Other variants may fall in coding regions, but may
      be silent on the protein level. Hence, we can prioritize our candidate
      variants after annotating them with predicted functional effects.

      Mapping-by-sequencing can greatly speed up and facilitate the molecular
      identification of mutations recovered from mutagenesis screens. The method
      makes extensive use of cross-sample comparison of variants and profits
      strongly from joint variant calling to generate reliable and manageable
      variant information. A combination of variant linkage analysis and
      filtering often results in very small lists of candidate variants that can
      then be confirmed through further experimental work. Importantly, the
      selection of biological samples for sequencing determines the meaningful
      variant comparisons that can be made in the bioinformatical analysis so it
      is important to understand the essence of the analysis method before the
      preparation of any biological samples.
