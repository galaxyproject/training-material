  for the disease using the exome sequencing data from both parents and the
  child.

  - title: Introduction

      Exome sequencing means that all protein-coding genes in a genome are
      sequenced.

      <br><br>In Humans, there are ~180,000 exons that makes up 1% of the human
      genome which contain ~30 million base pairs. Mutations in the exome have
      usually a higher impact and more severe consequences, than in the
      remaining 99% of the genome.

      <br><br>With exome sequencing, one can identify genetic variation that is
      responsible for both Mendelian and common diseases without the high costs
      associated with whole-genome sequencing. Indeed, exome sequencing is the
      most efficient way to identify the genetic variants in all of an
      individual’s genes. Exome sequencing is cheaper also than whole-genome
      sequencing. With a high coverage rate of 100+ DP, 98% of all exons are
      covered.

      Items where exome sequencing can’t identify genetic variation in:<ul>
        <li>All genes</li></ul>
      Not all genes are in your exon data, especially those buried in stretches
      of repeats out towards the chromosome tips, aren’t part of exome
      sequencing chips<ul>
        <li>The handful of genes that reside in mitochondria, rather than in the nucleus</li>
        <li><i>“Structural variants”</i> such as translocations and inversions, that move or flip DNA but don’t alter the base sequence.</li>
        <li><i>Triplet repeat disorders</i>, such as Huntington’s disease and fragile X syndrome can’t be detected.</li>
        <li>Other <i>copy number variants</i> will remain beneath the radar, for they too don’t change the sequence, but can increase disease risk.</li>
        <li><i>Introns</i></li>
      </ul>

      A mutation that jettisons a base in an intron can have dire consequences:
      inserting intron sequences into the protein, or obliterating the careful
      stitching together of exons, dropping gene sections. For example, a
      mutation in the apoE4 gene, associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk, puts
      part of an intron into the protein.<ul> <br><li><i>“Uniparental
      disomy”</i></li></ul> Two mutations from one parent, rather than one from
      each, appear the same in an exome screen: the kid has two mutations. But
      whether mutations come from only mom, only dad, or one from each has
      different consequences for risk to future siblings. In fact, a case of UPD
      reported in 1988 led to discovery of the cystic fibrosis gene.<ul>
      <br><li><i>Control sequences</i></li></ul> Much of the human genome tells
      the exome what to do, like a gigantic instruction manual for a tiny but
      vital device. For example, mutations in microRNAs cause cancer by
      silencing various genes, but the DNA that encodes about half of the 1,000
      or so microRNAs is intronic – and therefore not on exome chips.

      <ul> <br><li><i>Epigenetic changes</i></li></ul> Environmental factors can
      place shielding methyl groups directly onto DNA, blocking expression of
      certain genes. Starvation during the “Dutch Hunger Winter” of 1945, for
      example, is associated with schizophrenia in those who were fetuses at the
      time, due to methylation of certain genes. Exome sequencing picks up DNA
      sequences – not gene expression <ul> <br><li><i>Gene-gene (epistatic)
      interactions</i></li></ul> One gene affecting the expression of another
      can explain why siblings with the same single-gene disease suffer to a
      different extent. For example, a child with severe spinal muscular
      atrophy, in which an abnormal protein shortens axons of motor neurons, may
      have a brother who also inherits SMA but has a milder case thanks to a
      variant of a second gene that extends axons. Computational tools will need
      to sort out networks of interacting genes revealed in exome sequencing.

      In this tutorial, a child has a yet unknown disease. His parents are
      healthy. We will try to identify the genetic variation that is responsible
      for the disease using the exome sequencing data from both parents and the
      child. <br><br>Most of the data pre-processing have already be done on the
      raw exome sequencing. The raw exome sequences were mapped on <b>hg19</b>
      version of the human genome. So, for each family member, we will start
      with one BAM file with mapping results.

      <ul>
        <li>With exome sequencing, one can identify genetic variation that is responsible for some diseases</li>
        <li>Exome sequencing is the most efficient way to identify the genetic variants in all of an individual's genes</li>
        <li>One can use GEMINI queries to access database with all the genetic variants</li>
        <li>In order to generate such database one can use FreeBayes</li>
