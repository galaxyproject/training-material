    The beacon2 toolkit interacts with the beacon2 database collections to search for the records 
    that match the search terms. The toolkit has a list of subcommands to query several types of data 
    and metadata collections for a customised query. The tool provides access to the beacon database server 
    and checks if the users have access to view the database or what to return if there are no records that match the search criteria. 

    The tutorial guides the users on searching the beacon2 genomicVariants collection for CNV records.
