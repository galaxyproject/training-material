  "abstract": "The majority of life on Earth is non-diploid and represented by prokaryotes, viruses, and their derivatives, such as our own mitochondria or plant's chloroplasts. In non-diploid systems, allele frequencies can range anywhere between 0 and 100% and there could be multiple (not just two) alleles per locus. The main challenge associated with non-diploid variant calling is the difficulty in distinguishing between the sequencing noise (abundant in all NGS platforms) and true low frequency variants. Some of the early attempts to do this well have been accomplished on human mitochondrial DNA although the same approaches will work equally good on viral and bacterial genomes ({% cite Rebolledo-Jaramillo2014 %}, {% cite Li2015 %})."

                <p>The majority of life on Earth is non-diploid and represented by prokaryotes, viruses, and their derivatives, such as our own mitochondria or plant’s chloroplasts. In non-diploid systems, allele frequencies can range anywhere between 0 and 100% and there could be multiple (not just two) alleles per locus. The main challenge associated with non-diploid variant calling is the difficulty in distinguishing between the sequencing noise (abundant in all NGS platforms) and true low frequency variants. Some of the early attempts to do this well have been accomplished on human mitochondrial DNA although the same approaches will work equally good on viral and bacterial genomes (<span class="citation"><a href="#Rebolledo-Jaramillo2014">Rebolledo-Jaramillo <i>et al.</i> 2014</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#Li2015">Li <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>).</p>

<p>As an example of non-diploid systems, we will be using human mitochondrial genome. However, this approach will also work for most bacterial and viral genomes.</p>

<p>There are two ways one can call variants:</p>

<ol>
  <li>By comparing reads against an existing genome assembly</li>
  <li>By assembling a genome first and then mapping against that assembly</li>
</ol>

<figure id="figure-1" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/ref_vs_assembly.jpg" alt="2 approaches. " width="622" height="831" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/ref_vs_assembly.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> This figure from <span class="citation"><a href="#Olson2015">Olson <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span> contrasts the two approaches.</figcaption></figure>

<p>In this tutorial we will take the <em>first</em> path, in which we map reads against an existing assembly. Later in the course, after we learn about assembly approaches, we will try the second approach as well.</p>

<p>The goal of this example is to detect heteroplasmies - variants within mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria are transmitted maternally, and heteroplasmy frequencies may change dramatically and unpredictably during the transmission due to a germ-line bottleneck (<span class="citation"><a href="#Cree2008">Cree <i>et al.</i> 2008</a></span>). As we mentioned above, the procedure for finding variants in bacterial or viral genomes will be essentially the same.</p>

<p>Datasets representing a child and a mother are available in <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1251112">Zenodo</a>. These datasets were obtained by paired-end Illumina sequencing of human genomic DNA enriched for mitochondria. The enrichment was performed using long-range PCR with two primer pairs that amplify the entire mitochondrial genome. Samples will therefore still contain a lot of DNA from the nuclear genome, which, in this case, is a contaminant.</p>

<h2 id="removing-duplicates">Removing duplicates</h2>

<p>Preparation of sequencing libraries (at least at the time of writing) for technologies such as Illumina (used in this example) involves PCR amplification. It is required to generate sufficient number of sequencing templates so that a reliable detection can be performed by base callers. PCR has its own biases which are especially profound in cases of multi-template PCR used for construction of sequencing libraries (<span class="citation"><a href="#Kanagawa2003">Kanagawa 2003</a></span>).</p>

<p>Duplicates can be identified based on their outer alignment coordinates or using sequence-based clustering. One of the common ways for identification of duplicate reads is the <strong>MarkDuplicates</strong> utility from <a href="https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html">Picard</a> package which is designed to identify both PCR and optical duplicates.</p>

<blockquote class="details">
  <div class="box-title details-title" id="details-more-about-markduplicates"><button class="gtn-boxify-button details" type="button" aria-controls="details-more-about-markduplicates" aria-expanded="true"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Details: More about MarkDuplicates</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p>Duplicates are identified as read pairs having identical 5’ positions (coordinate and strand) for both reads in a mate pair (and optionally, matching unique molecular identifier reads; see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BARCODE_TAG</code> option). Optical, or more broadly sequencing, duplicates are duplicates that appear clustered together spatially during sequencing and can arise from optical/imagine-processing artifacts or from biochemical processes during clonal amplification and sequencing; they are identified using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">READ_NAME_REGEX</code> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPTICAL_DUPLICATE_PIXEL_DISTANCE</code> options. The tool’s main output is a new SAM or BAM file in which duplicates have been identified in the SAM flags field, or optionally removed (see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">REMOVE_DUPLICATE</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">REMOVE_SEQUENCING_DUPLICATES</code>), and optionally marked with a duplicate type in the ‘DT’ optional attribute. In addition, it also outputs a metrics file containing the numbers of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">READ_PAIRS_EXAMINED</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SECONDARY_OR_SUPPLEMENTARY_RDS</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UNMAPPED_READS</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UNPAIRED_READS</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UNPAIRED_READ DUPLICATES</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">READ_PAIR_DUPLICATES</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">READ_PAIR_OPTICAL_DUPLICATES</code>.</p>

<h2 id="left-aligning-indels">Left-aligning indels</h2>

<p>Left aligning of indels (a variant of re-aligning) is extremely important for obtaining accurate variant calls. For illustrating how left-aligning works, we expanded on an example provided by <span class="citation"><a href="#Tan2015">Tan <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>. Suppose you have a reference sequence and a sequencing read:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Reference GGGCACACACAGGG
Read      GGGCACACAGGG
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you look carefully you will see that the read is simply missing a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CA</code> repeat. But it is not apparent to a mapper, so some of possible alignments and corresponding variant calls include:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Alignment                 Variant Call

GGGCACACACAGGG            Ref: CAC
GGGCAC--ACAGGG            Alt: C

GGGCACACACAGGG            Ref: ACA
GGGCA--CACAGGG            Alt: A

GGGCACACACAGGG            Ref: GCA
GGG--CACACAGGG            Alt: G
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The last of these is <em>left-aligned</em>. In this case gaps (represented by dashes) are moved as far left as possible. For a formal definition of left-alignment and variant normalization, see <span class="citation"><a href="#Tan2015">Tan <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>.</p>

<h2 id="filtering-variants">Filtering variants</h2>

<p>After filtering the data with stringent input parameters (restricting base quality to a minimum of 30 and mapping quality to a minimum of 20) a considerable amount of variants due to read-alignment bias exists. <a href="https://github.com/ekg">Erik Garrison</a> has a beautiful illustration of various biases potentially affecting called variants and making a locus sequence-able.</p>

<figure id="figure-3" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/mt_biases.png" alt="Various biases potentially affecting called variants. " width="1175" height="839" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/mt_biases.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 3</strong>:</span> Here you can see that in an ideal case (indicated with a green star) a variant is evenly represent by different areas of sequencing reads (cycle and placement biases) and is balanced across the two strands (strand bias). Allele imbalance is not applicable in our case as it reflects significant deviation from the diploid (50/50) expectation.</figcaption></figure>

<p>A robust tool set for processing VCF data is provided by <a href="https://github.com/vcflib/vcflib">vcflib</a> developed by Erik Garrison, the author of FreeBayes. One way to filter VCF is using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INFO</code> fields of the VCF dataset. If you look at the VCF dataset shown above you will see all comment lines beginning with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">##INFO</code>.  These are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INFO</code> fields. Each VCF record contains a list of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INFO</code> tags describing a wide range of properties for each VCF record. You will see that FreeBayes and NVC differ significantly in the number and types of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INFO</code> fields each of these caller generates. This why the two require different filtering strategies.</p>

<p>Among numerous types of data generated by FreeBayes let’s consider the following variant properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">##INFO=&lt;ID=DP,Number=1,Type=Integer,Description="Total read depth at the locus"&gt;</code> - This is the number of reads covering a given site.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">##INFO=&lt;ID=SRP,Number=1,Type=Float,Description="Strand balance probability for the reference allele: Phred-scaled upper-bounds estimate of the probability of observing the deviation between SRF and SRR given E(SRF/SRR) ~ 0.5, derived using Hoeffding's inequality"&gt;</code> - The higher this quantity the better the site as it diminishes the chance of the site having significant strand bias.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">##INFO=&lt;ID=SAP,Number=A,Type=Float,Description="Strand balance probability for the alternate allele: Phred-scaled upper-bounds estimate of the probability of observing the deviation between SAF and SAR given E(SAF/SAR) ~ 0.5, derived using Hoeffding's inequality"&gt;</code> - The higher this quantity the better the site as it diminishes the chance of the site having significant strand bias  (also see this <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/freebayes/fX4TOAqXJrA">discussion on the freebayes forum</a>).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">##INFO=&lt;ID=EPP,Number=A,Type=Float,Description="End Placement Probability: Phred-scaled upper-bounds estimate of the probability of observing the deviation between EL and ER given E(EL/ER) ~ 0.5, derived using Hoeffding's inequality"&gt;</code> - The higher this number the lower the chance of having significant placement bias.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QUAL</code> - phred scaled variant quality.</li>
</ul>

<p>For visualizing VCFs Galaxy has two external tool options. The first is called <a href="http://vcf.iobio.io/">VCF.IOBIO</a> developed by <a href="http://marthlab.org/">Gabor Marth’s group</a> at the University of Utah. The second is called <a href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/">IGV</a> developed by Broad Institute.</p>

<p>Visualizing VCF datasets is a good way to get an overall idea of the data, but it does not tell a lot of details. For example, above we have visualized site 3243 using IGV. It is interesting but we need to find out more. One thing we can do is to convert VCF dataset into a tab-delimited representation and with it play a bit more.</p>

<p>Running Cut will generate the following dataset:</p>

5539	A	G	raw_mother-ds-	301	488

<p>Let’s look at position 3243. At this site, the mother sample has 671 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">G</code>s (since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">G</code> is the alternative allele) and 2057-671=1386 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>s. The child sample has 694 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">G</code>s and 1035-694=341 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>s:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Allele     A     G

					<b>Liked</b>: I like the idea
					<b>Disliked</b>: After running the FreeBayes I ended up with 2 variants instead of 30.  And so got stuck there.  Also it's not clear why the filtering and subsequent steps would be done on the markduplicates output, rather than the left align output.  Why do the leftalign if we don't use that output again?  I did both and got the same results. Overall I am finding the galaxy experience to be rather frustrating.  I'm trying to decide whether to incorporate these tutorials in my class, but often I can't find the necessary input data, get unexplained errors, or get output different from the tutorial
