                <p>Of the four species of influenza viruses (Influenza A-D), <em>Influenza A</em> is the most virulent in human hosts and subtypes of it have been responsible for all historic flu pandemics.</p>

<p>The different influenza species infect distinct animal hosts (though all of them can infect humans and pigs) and the most important natural reservoir for <em>Influenza A</em> are birds (in particular, wild aquatic birds), in which it causes <strong>Avian influenza</strong>.</p>

<p>Importantly, all flu pandemics of the last century have been triggered by <strong>reassortment</strong> events between avian and human <em>Influenza A</em> strains (although at least the 2009 swine flu pandemic involved an additional mixing event with an <em>Influenza A</em> strain from pigs).</p>

<p>Reassortment events are a key trait of <em>Influenza A</em> made possible by its wide range of natural hosts combined with two molecular characteristics of the species:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the linear negative-sense single-stranded RNA genomes of influenza viruses (and of all viruses of the <em>Orthomyxoviridae</em> family) are segmented, i.e. consist of several (eight in the case of <em>Influenza A</em> and <em>B</em>) distinct pieces of RNA, which typically encode just one, sometimes two viral proteins.</li>
  <li>the mutation rate in the genome is high in influenza viruses, and particularly high in <em>Influenza A</em>, since their RNA polymerase lacks exonuclease activity necessary for proof-reading.</li>
</ol>

<p>Together these characteristics enable <em>Influenza A</em> to evolve relatively rapidly in non-human hosts, then re-adapt to humans through exchange of segments (reassortment) in a host co-infected with a human and, <em>e.g.</em>, an avian strain. If such a reassortment introduces new variants of the two most antigenic proteins of influenza, HA (hemagglutinin) and NA (neuraminidase), this antigenic shift provides the reassorted strain with immune escape potential, which, if it happens in a genetic background compatible with efficient transmission in humans, can trigger an unusually strong wave of influenza or even a new pandemic.</p>

<p>In order to estimate the likelihood of an epidemic or pandemic influenza event in the near future it is, therefor, important to monitor closely the genome composition of circulating Avian Influenza strains in wild and domestic birds and the huge technological advances over the last decade make it possible to use next-generation sequencing for this purpose.</p>

<p>At the same time, the segmented nature of their genomes combined with high genetic variability, especially in the HA and NA genes, requires rather specialized bioinformatics workflows for the analysis of data from influenza viruses compared to other viruses with similar genome size (like, <em>e.g.</em> SARS-CoV-2):</p>

<p>The viral surface proteins HA and (to a lesser extent) NA are the main targets of the host antibody response and are, thus, under constant selection pressure to mutate into forms capable of evading an existing host immune response. As a consequence, these segments have evolved into a much richer panel of sequence variants than the other segments, to the point that sequences of the HA segment can, at present, be classified into 18 distinct subfamilies, H1-H18, while there are 11 recognized subfamilies of NA, and <em>Influenza A</em> strains are subtyped (as, for example, H5N1, H3N2, etc.) according to the combination of HA- and NA-encoding segments they are carrying.</p>

<p>Importantly, the sequence diversity of HA and (again to a lesser extent) of NA segments is big enough to prevent a naive approach of mapping sequenced reads to one specific agreed-upon <em>Influenza A</em> reference sequence. While this would work for the other six segments, mapping software would regularly fail to find enough plausible mappings for sequenced reads of HA and NA origin to continue analysis with. This is why, in this tutorial we are going to explore an alternative approach, which is also mapping-based but chooses a suitable reference for each segment dynamically based on the input sequencing data.</p>

<h1 id="prepare-analysis-history-and-data">Prepare analysis history and data</h1>

<p>In this tutorial you are going to work on a single avian influenza sample sequenced in paired-end mode on the Illumina platform, <em>i.e.</em> we are going to download two datasets of sequenced reads for that sample.</p>

<p>In addition, we are going to base the analysis on a small collection of multiple reference sequences for each influenza gene segment. We prepared this collection for you from public <a href="https://insaflu.insa.pt/dashboard/">INSAFlu</a> <a href="https://insaflu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/uploading_data.html?highlight=references#uploading-reference-data">data</a>.</p>

<p>If you have your own curated collection of reference sequences, you should be able to use it to follow this tutorial without any problem. Note, however, that the analysis results referred to in many of the questions will be different if you are exchanging the reference collection.
If you want to learn how you can create a Galaxy collection from your own references that is structured like the default we are suggesting here, you may want to follow the dedicated tutorial on <a href="/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/collections/tutorial.html">Using dataset collections</a>.</p>

<h1 id="get-a-history-with-reference-data">Get a history with reference data</h1>

<p>Any analysis should get its own Galaxy history, but in this tutorial we <em>won’t</em> start with creating one.</p>

<p>Instead, to save some time, you can copy an existing shared history on Galaxy Europe.</p>

            <li>Each element has data for 56 sequences (Galaxy knows how to interpret the fasta format of the sequencing data and counts sequences for you; you can see the count for any of the elements by expanding it).</li>
            <li>The collection has reference sequence data for H1-H18 (with the exception of H11) and for N1-N11. For many of those subtypes, however, there is only one reference, i.e., within-subtype variation is not captured well by the collection.</li>
            <li>There are 6 <em>Influenza B</em> references in the collection. Since <em>Influenza B</em> is not normally seen in birds and we are going to analyze an avian influenza sample here, these can be considered controls: if we get an <em>Influenza B</em> assignment for the sample at any step in our analysis, we know something is very suspicious. This also means that we only have 50 <em>informative</em> references in the collection.</li>

<p><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">galaxy-info</span> There are lots of text processing and filtering tools for Galaxy, of which this tutorial is going to introduce just a small subset. You could use them to extract statistics about which subtypes are found how many times in the collection of references instead of relying on scrolling and searching. If you are interested and have the time, you may want to try the <a href="/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/data-manipulation-olympics/tutorial.html">Data Manipulation Olympics</a> to learn more about available such tools and how to combine them.</p>

<h1 id="quality-control">Quality control</h1>

<p>As a very first step, we would like to make sure that we base our analysis only on the high-quality parts of the sequenced reads.</p>

<p>NGS reads often have lower base calling quality near their ends, so here we are going to trim low-quality stretches of bases from both ends. In addition, we are going to discard reads shorter than 30 bases after trimming. This is reasonable since our next step will involve extracting all possible 21-mers from the reads and there are very few possibilities for a read shorter than 30 bases.</p>

<p>The tool <strong>fastp</strong> lets us perform these tasks and obtain a nice quality report for our reads before and after processing in one go, but many other options exist to perform sequenced reads quality control and trimming/filtering in Galaxy and the dedicated tutorial on <a href="/training-material/topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.html">quality control</a> introduces more of them.</p>

        <p>fastp comes with basic default settings for some of its many parameters.
In particular, with no explicit parameter specifications, the tool will still remove reads that</p>
        <ul>
          <li>have base qualities &lt; 15 for more than 40% of their bases</li>
          <li>have more than 5 Ns in their sequence</li>
          <li>
            <p>have a length &lt; 15 bases (after removing poly-G tails from Illumina reads)</p>

            <p>Because our input data has far longer MiSeq-generated reads, we can increase this length threshold to 30 bases as done above.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>These are very relaxed criteria that will only remove the least usable reads, but still assure minimal
quality standards that are good enough for many (including training) purposes.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Running the tool will result in two outputs. One is a new paired collection with the processed reads, the other one is a report of initial quality, the processing actions performed and their effect on key quality metrics.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>The forward reads were of worse quality in particular near their 3’-ends than the reverse reads and, consequently, were affected more strongly by trimming (see the different “quality” plots in the report).</li>
            <li>Less than 2% of reads got discarded completely (the “Filtering result” section of the report says 98.03% of all reads were retained). In contrast, around 10% of all bases got discarded (compare total bases before and after filtering) so most reads got trimmed but not discarded.</li>
            <li>As explained in the “fastp default settings” box above, <strong>fastp</strong> is a tool with many hidden default actions in its various sections.
Inside the <em>Filter Options</em> inspect <em>Quality filtering options</em> and the various defaults mentioned in the parameters help therein. One of these defaults is to discard reads with more than 5 Ns. These defaults are often reasonable, but it’s good to be aware of them.</li>

<h1 id="per-segment-subtyping-and-hybrid-reference-construction">Per-segment subtyping and hybrid reference construction</h1>

<p>Our goal at this step is to find best matches between our sequencing data and the reference sequences of each genome segment. This will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>give us preliminary subtyping results with regard to the HA and NA segments for the sequenced sample</li>
  <li>suggest the best reference to map the sequencing data to for each segment.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are then going to combine the best reference of each segment into a hybrid reference genome to use for mapping our sequenced reads against.</p>

<p>To identify the best matching reference segments, we are going to run the tool <strong>VAPOR</strong> asking it to report the stats for any hits it identifies.</p>

            <li>
              <p>The best match (assigned an almost 2x higher score than the second-best match) found for the HA segment is from an H4N6 strain.

<p>If things went well, the hybrid reference we just obtained should be close enough across all segments to our sample to allow successful mapping of reads.

            <li>Coverage is rather different for the different segments. Looking at “Mean coverage” and its “Standard deviation” in the “Chromosome stats” table and at the “Coverage across reference” plot, coverage of the HA segment seems to be most critical since it approaches zero in some regions.</li>
            <li>Mapping quality is almost constant at or very near 60 (which happens to be the maximum mapping quality value emitted by BWA-MEM) across all segments with the exception of HA.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>These two observations combined with the VAPOR statistics for HA show again that even the best matching reference for this segment is not exactly close to the sequence of our sample. The read mapper had difficulties placing the sequenced reads on that sub-optimal reference and it looks as if we might have very little sequence information for some HA regions.</p>

<h1 id="consensus-sequence-construction">Consensus sequence construction</h1>

<p>From the polished mapping of reads to our custom reference we can now construct the consensus sequence of our sample.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the tool we are going to use for this, <strong>ivar consensus</strong>, is not capable of working with more than one reference name at a time, but because this is influenza data we have mappings to 8 different segments described in our data. So we need to take a little detour and split the mapped reads data into a collection of datasets each containing the mappings for just one segment first again, then perform the consensus construction for all of them in parallel.</p>

<p>The output from this step has the desired collection structure, but the names of the collection elements are not the nicest.

<p>And with that we are ready for consensus sequence generation!</p>

<p>To accept any base suggested by the mapped sequenced reads as the consensus base for the corresponding genome position, we ask for the following requirements to be fulfilled:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at least ten sequenced reads have to provide information about the base in question</li>
  <li>at a minimum, 70% of these reads have to agree on the base at this position.</li>
</ul>

<p>To avoid getting misled too much by sequencing errors, we are also going to ignore bases with a base calling quality less than 20 in the above counts (i.e., we are going to base our decisions only on bases in sequenced reads that the basecaller of the sequencer was reasonably sure about.</p>

<p>Now what if we cannot obtain a consensus base for a position with the above criteria? In such cases of uncertainty we want to insert an N (i.e. an unknown base) to express that we either did not have enough information about the position or that this information was ambiguous.</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">galaxy-info</span> All of the above limits for consensus base calling are arbitrary to some degree, and depend somewhat on the quality of the sequencing data. With very high overall coverage, for example, it is possible to increase the coverage threshold, but if you increase that threshold too much, you may end up with a consensus sequence consisting mostly of Ns.</p>

<h1 id="placing-segments-on-a-phylogenetic-tree">Placing segments on a phylogenetic tree</h1>

<p>The next logical step after obtaining the consensus sequences of segments of our sample is to explore how those sequences are related to the sequences in our reference collection.
To do so, we are going to combine the reference sequences of all segments with their corresponding consensus sequence into one multiple sequence alignment (MSA) per segment, and use these to generate phylogenetic trees, again one per segment. We are going to use two rather standard tools, <strong>MAFFT</strong> and <strong>IQTree</strong>, for generating MSAs and trees, respectively.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Analysis workflows for influenza whole-genome sequencing data need to take into account the specific characteristics of the viral genome. Due to their higher natural variability this is especially true for avian influenza samples and for the HA- and NA-encoding segments of the genome.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it looks possible, with carefully chosen reference segment sequences and bioinformatic tools, to avoid a computationally expensive de-novo assembly approach and to use mapping against a dynamically compiled reference genome instead.</p>

<p>The rather small reference segment collection suggested for this tutorial consists of 56 different samples, of which only a single one has the H4N6 subtype of the sample analyzed here. Still it allowed us to perform subtyping of the sample, to construct complete consensus sequences for 7 segments including NA, and to draw valuable conclusions about the origin of the sample. It is conceivable that a larger collection of references chosen to capture several strains from each HA subtype could solve the remaining issue of the incomplete HA consensus sequence.</p>
