                <p>Sequence-based monitoring of global infectious disease crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, requires capacity to generate and analyze large volumes of sequencing data in near real time. These data have proven essential for surveilling the emergence and spread of new viral variants, and for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of the virus.</p>

<p>The tutorial <a href="/training-material/topics/variant-analysis/tutorials/sars-cov-2/tutorial.html">SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data analysis</a> shows in detail how you can identify mutations in SARS-CoV-2 samples from paired-end whole-genome sequencing data generated on the Illumina platform.</p>

<p>For versatile and efficient genome surveillance, however, you would want to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be able to analyze data of different origin</p>

    <p>Besides WGS paired-end Illumina data, different labs are generating also single-end Illumina and ONT data, and are combining these platforms with various tiled-amplicon approaches upstream of sequencing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>go beyond per-sample mutation calls in variant call format (VCF)</p>

    <p>To keep track of large numbers of samples sequenced in batches (as, nowadays, produced routinely by SARS-CoV-2 genome surveillance initiatives across the globe), you need concise reports and visualizations of results at the sample and batch level.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use sample mutation patterns to construct sample consensus genomes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use the consensus genomes to assign the samples to SARS-CoV-2 lineages as defined by major lineage classification systems (<a href="https://nextstrain.org/blog/2022-04-29-SARS-CoV-2-clade-naming-2022">Nextstrain clades</a> and <a href="https://www.pango.network/">PANGO</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>decrease hands-on time and data manipulation errors by combining analysis steps into workflows for automated execution</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how a set of workflows developed by the <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/projects/covid19/">Galaxy Covid-19 project</a> can be combined and used together with a handful of additional tools to achieve all of the above. Specifically, we will cover the analysis flow presented in figure 1.</p>

<figure id="figure-1" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/sars-cov-2-variant-discovery/schema.png" alt="Analysis flow in the tutorial. " width="768" height="713" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/sars-cov-2-variant-discovery/schema.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> Analysis flow in the tutorial</figcaption></figure>

<p>Depending on the type of sequencing data <strong>one of four variation analysis workflows</strong> can be run to discover mutations in a batch of input samples. Outputs of any of these workflows can then be processed further with two additional workflows: the <strong>variation reporting workflow</strong> generates a per-sample report of mutations, but also batch-level reports and visualizations, while the <strong>consensus construction workflow</strong> reconstructs the full viral genomes of all samples in the batch by modifying the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome with each sample’s set of mutations.</p>

<p>A few highlights of these workflows are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All the variation analysis workflows are more sensitive than they need to be for consensus sequence generation, i.e. they can not only be used to capture fixed or majority alleles, but can also be used on their own to address less routine questions such as co-infections with two viral lineages or shifting intrahost allele-frequencies in, for example, immunocompromised, longterm-infected patients.</li>
  <li>The reporting workflow produces a batch-level overview plot of mutations and their observed allele-frequencies that enables spotting of batch-effects like sample cross-contamination and outlier samples that are different from the rest of the batch.</li>
  <li>The consensus workflow can express uncertainty about any base position in the generated consensus sequence by N-masking the position according to user-defined thresholds.</li>
  <li>All of the workflows are openly developed and available in the form of defined releases through major public workflow registries.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this tutorial you will learn to</p>
<ul>
  <li>obtain releases of the workflows from public registries</li>
  <li>set up input data for different types of sequencing protocols</li>
  <li>run and combine the workflows</li>
  <li>understand the various outputs produced by the workflows and to extract insight about viral samples from them</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="prepare-galaxy-and-data">Prepare Galaxy and data</h1>

<p>The suggested input for this tutorial is a special batch of data that is of particular interest as it represents a turning point in the COVID-19 pandemic.
It is a subset (16 samples) of the first sequencing data reported from South Africa at the end of November 2021 for the then novel, fast-spreading SARS-CoV-2 variant that would later be named Omicron.
This data has been Illumina paired-end sequenced after amplification with the ARTIC v4 set of tiled-amplicon primers.</p>

<blockquote class="comment">
  <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-bringing-your-own-data"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment: Bringing your own data</div>
  <p>Alternatively, you can also follow this tutorial using your own SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data (you need at least two samples) as long as it is of one of the following types:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Single-end data derived from Illumina-based whole-genome sequencing experiments</li>
    <li>Paired-end data derived from Illumina-based whole-genome sequencing experiments</li>
    <li>Paired-end data generated with Illumina-based tiled-amplicon (e.g. ARTIC) protocols</li>
    <li>ONT FASTQ files generated with Oxford nanopore (ONT)-based tiled-amplicon (e.g. ARTIC) protocols</li>
  </ul>

  <p><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">warning</span> If you are using your own <em>tiled-amplicon</em> data, you are also expected to know the primer scheme used at the amplification step.</p>

  <p>If you are going to use your own sequencing data, there are several possibilities to upload the data depending on how many datasets you have and what their origin is:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>You can import data</p>

      <ul>
        <li>from your local file system,</li>
        <li>from a given URL or</li>
        <li>from a shared data library on the Galaxy server you are working on</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In all of these cases you will also have to organize the imported data into a dataset collection like explained in detail for the suggested example data.</p>

      <blockquote class="details">
        <div class="box-title details-title" id="details-data-logistics"><button class="gtn-boxify-button details" type="button" aria-controls="details-data-logistics" aria-expanded="true"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Details: Data logistics</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

        <p>A detailed explanation of all of the above-mentioned options for getting your data into Galaxy and organizing it in your history is beyond the scope of this tutorial.
If you are struggling with getting your own data set up like shown for the example data in this section, please:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Option 1: Browse some of the material on <a href="/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface">Using Galaxy and Managing your Data</a></li>
          <li>Option 2: Consult the FAQs on <a href="/training-material/faqs/galaxy/index.html#data%20upload">uploading data</a> and on <a href="/training-material/faqs/galaxy/index.html#collections">collections</a></li>
          <li>Option 3: Watch some of the related brief videos from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNFLKDpdM3B9UaxWEXgziHXO3k-003FzE"><i class="fas fa-video" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">video</span> Galactic introductions</a> playlist.</li>
        </ul>

      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Alternatively, if your data is available from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra">NCBI’s Sequence Read Archive (SRA)</a>, you can import it with the help of a dedicated tool, which will organize the data into collections for you.</p>

      <blockquote class="details">

        <p>The simpler <a href="/training-material/topics/variant-analysis/tutorials/sars-cov-2/tutorial.html">SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data analysis tutorial</a> uses and explains this alternative way of importing.</p>

    </li>
  </ul>

<p>For the suggested batch of early Omicron data we suggest downloading it via URLs from the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home">European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)</a>. In case your Galaxy server offers that same data through a shared data library, this represents a faster (data is already on the server) alternative, so we offer instructions for this scenario as well.</p>

<p>Another two datasets are needed only for the analysis of ampliconic, e.g. ARTIC-amplified, input data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a BED file specifying the primers used during amplification and their binding sites on the viral genome</li>
  <li>a custom tabular file describing the amplicon grouping of the primers (currently NOT used for tiled-amplicon ONT data)</li>
</ul>

Provide the correct primer scheme and amplicon info.</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p>The instructions below assume that you are going to analyze viral samples amplified using <strong>version 4 of the ARTIC network’s SARS-CoV-2 set of primers</strong>, which is the case for the suggested Omicron batch of data.</p>

  <p>If you have decided to analyze your own tiled-amplicon sequencing data in this tutorial, and if your samples have been amplified with a <strong>different</strong> set of primers, you are supposed, at the following step, to upload a primer scheme file and corresponding amplicon information that describes this set of primers.</p>

  <p>The Galaxy Project maintains a <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4555734">collection of such files for some commonly used sets of primers</a>.
If the files describing your set of primers are part of this collection, you can simply upload them using their Zenodo download URLs (analogous to what is shown for the ARTIC v4 primers below).</p>

  <p>For sets of primers <em>not</em> included in the collection, you will have to create those files yourself (or obtain them from other sources).
The expected format for the primer scheme file is 6-column BED format, while the amplicon info file is a simple tabular format that lists all primer names (which must be identical to the ones used in the primer scheme file) that contribute to formation of the same amplicon on a single tab-separated line.
If in doubt, download the ARTIC v4 files through the URLs provided below, and use them as a template for your own custom files.</p>

<p>If everything looks fine, you are ready to start the actual data analysis.</p>

<h1 id="analysis">Analysis</h1>

<p>As shown in figure 1, the analysis will consist mainly of running three workflows - one for calling the mutations for each input sample, one for reporting the findings and one for generating sample consensus sequences based on the identified mutations.</p>

<p>You will also run a handful of individual tools, in particular for generating and exploring lineage assignments for the input samples.</p>

<p>Along the way you will interpret key outputs of each used workflow and tool to get a complete picture of what can be learnt about the genomes of the input samples.</p>

<h2 id="from-sequencing-data-to-annotated-mutations-per-sample">From sequencing data to annotated mutations per sample</h2>

<p>To identify mutations from sequencing data, the first workflow performs steps including</p>

<ul>
  <li>sequencing data quality control with filtering and trimming of low-quality reads</li>
  <li>mapping</li>
  <li>filtering and further processing of mapped reads (including primer-trimming in case of tiled-amplicon data)</li>
  <li>calling of mutations</li>
  <li>annotation of identified mutations with their effects on open-reading frames (ORFs) and proteins</li>
</ul>

<p>Four flavors of this workflow are available that are optimized for different types of input data so your first task is to obtain the correct workflow for your type of input data.</p>

  <p><em>IWC</em> (the intergalactic workflow commission) is the organization that the Galaxy Covid-19 project uses to publish its workflows, and the name restriction makes sure we are only getting workflows from that organization that deal with SARS-CoV-2 data analysis.</p>

  <p>Depending on your input data you will need to select the appropriate workflow from the list of hits returned by the workflow registry server.
This would be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>sars-cov-2-pe-illumina-artic-variant-calling/COVID-19-PE-ARTIC-ILLUMINA</strong></p>

      <p>if you are working with the suggested batch of samples for this tutorial, or if your own data is tiled-amplicon data sequenced on the Illumina platform in paired-end mode</p>

      <p>Once imported into Galaxy, this workflow appear under the name: <strong>COVID-19: variation analysis on ARTIC PE data</strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>sars-cov-2-ont-artic-variant-calling/COVID-19-ARTIC-ONT</strong></p>

      <p>if you are working with tiled-amplicon data sequenced on the ONT platform</p>

      <p>Once imported into Galaxy, this workflow appear under the name: <strong>COVID-19: variation analysis of ARTIC ONT data</strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>sars-cov-2-pe-illumina-wgs-variant-calling/COVID-19-PE-WGS-ILLUMINA</strong></p>

      <p>if you are working with WGS (i.e. non-ampliconic) data obtained on the Illumina platform in paired-end mode</p>

      <p>Once imported into Galaxy, this workflow appear under the name: <strong>COVID-19: variation analysis on WGS PE data</strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>sars-cov-2-se-illumina-wgs-variant-calling/COVID-19-SE-WGS-ILLUMINA</strong></p>

      <p>if you are working with WGS data obtained on the Illumina platform in single-end mode</p>

      <p>Once imported into Galaxy, this workflow appear under the name: <strong>COVID-19: variation analysis on WGS SE data</strong>.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>In all cases, the latest version of the workflow should be fine to use in this tutorial.</p>

  <p>Differences between the four different <em>variation analysis</em> workflow flavors are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All workflows for analysis of Illumina data use a core analysis flow through <strong>bwa-mem</strong> (or <strong>bowtie2</strong> for single-end data) as the read mapper and <strong>lofreq</strong> as a sensitive variant caller (which is capable of identifying also non-majority variant alleles), while the workflow for analysis of ONT data uses <strong>minimap2</strong> and <strong>medaka</strong> for read mapping and variant calling, respectively.</li>
    <li>Workflows for analysis of tiled-amplicon data differ from WGS data analysis ones in that they do not perform mapped reads deduplication (because apparent duplicates are a side-effect of sequencing defined amplicons instead of random genome fragments).
In addition, the tiled-amplicon data analysis workflows handle primer trimming and amplicon-based filtering through the <strong>ivar</strong> suite of tools and additional processing logic.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All four workflows use <strong>fastp</strong> for quality control, raw reads filtering and trimming, and <strong>SnpEff</strong>, specifically its 4.5covid19 version, for annotation of mutation effects.</p>

            <p>A common mistake here is to mix up the last two datasets: the <em>primer BED</em> dataset is the one with the positions of the primer binding sites listed in it. The <em>amplicon assignments</em> dataset contains only (grouped) names of primers.</p>

        <p>The additional workflow parameters <em>“Read removal minimum AF”</em>, <em>“Read removal maximum AF”</em>, <em>“Minimum DP required after amplicon bias correction”</em> and <em>“Minimum DP_ALT required after amplicon bias correction”</em> can all be left at their default values. The tiled-amplicon Illumina workflow goes to great lengths in order to calculate accurate allele-frequencies even in cases of viral mutations that affect the binding of some of the tiled-amplicon primers.

This is very useful if you are planning to analyze the data in your current history in multiple different ways, and you would like to have each analysis end up in its own dedicated history.
Here, however, we only want to do one analysis of our batch of data so we are fine with results of the workflow run getting added to the current history.</p>
  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Scheduling of the workflow will take a while. One of the last datasets that will be added to your history will be called <strong>Preprocessing and mapping reports</strong>. It is the first overview report that you will obtain in this tutorial, and the only one produced by the variation analysis workflow.</p>

<p>Once this dataset is ready take a moment to explore its content. It contains potentially valuable information about coverage of reads mapped to the reference genome and quality statistics for these reads. Technical issues with any samples in a batch are typically visible in this report already and spotting them early can often prevent overinterpretation of later reports.</p>

<p>If you are following along with the suggested batch of samples, we also have prepared a simple question for you.</p>

<blockquote class="question">
  <div class="box-title question-title" id="question"><i class="far fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Question</div>

    <li>There are at least three problematic samples in the batch. What are their identifiers and what is the issue with them?</li>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The three samples are <strong>SRR17054505</strong>, <strong>SRR17054506</strong> and <strong>SRR17054508</strong>.</p>

        <p>The problem with all three is poor coverage as can be seen from the “General Statistics” section.
When you inspect the “Cumulative genome coverage” plot, you can see that a fourth sample, <strong>SRR17054502</strong>, is not that much better than two of these three.</p>

        <p>Coverage of the worst sample, <strong>SRR17054505</strong>, is critically low and we cannot expect very usable mutation calls from it.
For the other three we may hope for some results, but we should not expect those to be perfect.</p>

    <p>This plot represents the allele-frequencies (AFs, cell color) for the different mutations (columns) in the different samples (rows). Mutations are grouped by viral ORFs (different colors on the 1st row). Information about their impact on translation of viral proteins is color-coded on the second row. Sample clustering is indicated by the tree displayed on the left.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you are working with your own data, we encourage you to just explore these three outputs on your own. If you are following along with the suggested batch of example data, then we have some guidance and questions prepared for you:</p>

  <p>The variant frequency plot shows a large main cluster of samples (in the middle of the plot) flanked by two smaller ones.
The small cluster at the bottom of the plot consists of only two samples, the cluster at the top of three samples.</p>

  <p>Questions</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Do you recognize some of the sample identifiers in the two small clusters?</p>

    <li>
      <p>What is unique about sample <strong>SRR17051933</strong>?</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The two samples forming the smallest cluster, <strong>SRR17054502</strong> and <strong>SRR17054506</strong>, and two of the samples in the three-samples cluster, <strong>SRR17054505</strong> and <strong>SRR17054508</strong>, are exactly the four samples we observed as having particularly low coverage in the <strong>Preprocessing and mapping reports</strong> before.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Only a single mutation was identified for <strong>SRR17054505</strong> (i.e. it is <em>very</em> different from all other samples).</p>

        <p>(By zooming far enough into the plot, or by looking up the sample in the <strong>Combined Variant Report by Sample</strong> you can learn that this single variant is 27,807 C-&gt;T.)</p>

        <p>From the <strong>Preprocessing and mapping reports</strong> we had learnt before that <strong>SRR17054505</strong> is the sample with critically low coverage. With hardly any sequence information available, even the best variant calling software will probably not be able to identify many mutations for this sample. Chances are that at least for this sample, lots of mutations have simply been missed.</p>

        <p>Knowing that the other three samples have a bit higher coverage than <strong>SRR17054505</strong>, one might speculate that for them maybe only <em>some</em> mutations went unidentified, and that might explain why they end up outside the main cluster in the variant frequency plot. At the moment that is speculation, but we will revisit that idea later.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What is striking about <strong>SRR17051933</strong> are all the red cells it has in the variant frequency plot.</p>

        <p>Many of these overlap with black cells of other samples, but some of the darkest cells for <strong>SRR17051933</strong> do not.</p>

        <p>Cell color indicates the allele frequency observed for a mutation in a given sample, and pitch-black corresponds to an allele frequency of ~ 1, i.e. to mutations that were found on nearly every sequenced read that overlaps the site of the mutation. The lighter colors for almost all mutations found for <strong>SRR17051933</strong> mean that for this sample some reads at mutation sites confirm the mutation, but typically many do not. We can look at the mutations in this sample also in the <strong>Combined Variant Report by Sample</strong> and confirm that many of these mutations have really low values in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AF</code> column.</p>

        <p>What about the mutations that seem to be unique to <strong>SRR17051933</strong> from the plot?
We can obtain a nice tabular report of them by filtering the <strong>Combined Variant Report by Variant</strong>.</p>

        <p>Run <span class="tool" data-tool="Filter1" title="Filter data on any column using simple expressions tool" aria-role="button"><i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Filter data on any column using simple expressions</strong></span> with</p>

          <li><em>“Number of header lines to skip”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Column 15 of <strong>Combined Variant Report by Variant</strong> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SAMPLES(all)</code>, i.e. lists all samples for which a given mutation in the report has been identified (at any allele frequency). The filtering above will retain those lines from the report that list <strong>SRR17051933</strong> as the <em>only</em> sample.</p>

        <p>When you inspect the output, you can see that it lists 17 <strong>SRR17051933</strong>-specific variants and you can read off the allele frequencies at which they were observed in the sample from column 13 (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">max(AF)</code>).
It is relatively obvious then that most of these variants have a AF value between 0.68 and 0.8, i.e. they are confirmed by the majority of reads, but not all of them.</p>

        <p>We will come back to this observation and look for possible explanations near the end of the tutorial.</p>

<h2 id="from-mutations-per-sample-to-consensus-sequences">From mutations per sample to consensus sequences</h2>

<p>We can now run a last workflow which generates reliable consensus sequences according to transparent criteria that capture at least some of the complexity of variant calling:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each consensus sequence produced by the workflow is guaranteed to capture all called, filter-passing mutations as defined in the VCF of its sample that reach a user-defined consensus allele frequency threshold.</li>
  <li>Filter-failing mutations and mutations below a second user-defined minimal allele frequency threshold are ignored.</li>
  <li>Genomic positions of filter-passing mutations with an allele frequency in between the two thresholds are hard-masked (with N) in the consensus sequence of their sample.</li>
  <li>Genomic positions with a coverage (calculated from the aligned reads for the sample) below another user-defined threshold are hard-masked, too, unless they are sites of consensus alleles.</li>

<p>Unfortunately, not all consensus sequences are equal in terms of quality. As explained above, questionable mutations and low coverage can lead to N-masking of individual nucleotides or whole stretches of bases in any sample’s consensus genome.</p>

<p>Since these Ns are hard to discover by just scrolling through a consensus sequence fasta dataset, it is a good idea to have their positions reported explicitly.</p>

      <p>We know from the quality report produced as part of the <em>variation analysis</em> workflow that samples <strong>SRR17054505</strong>, <strong>SRR17054506</strong>, <strong>SRR17054508</strong> and <strong>SRR17054502</strong> suffer from low-coverage sequencing data.</p>

      <p>In how far is this reflected in the generated consensus sequences for these samples?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The variant frequency plot (generated as part of the <em>reporting</em> workflow) showed all four of these samples as outliers outside of the main cluster of samples.</p>

      <p>Since the plot does not show coverage at sites of mutations, it cannot be determined from the plot alone whether a mutation missing from particular samples did not get reported because the sample does not harbor it, or simply because there was insufficient coverage for detecting it. The report of consensus sequence N stretches, however, can help here.</p>

      <p>Are the four samples really lacking all those mutations that are characteristic for the main cluster of samples, or may they have just gone undetected due to insufficient coverage?</p>

        <p>Most mutations that look like they are missing from the four samples based on the plot alone, turn out to simply be undeterminable as they also correspond to Ns (instead of to the reference allele in the corresponding consensus sequences.</p>

What is that lineage?</p>

    <li>
      <p>Which three samples did not get assigned to that lineage?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Can you explain the results for these three samples?</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <blockquote class="solution">

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The lineage summary we have generated makes this easy to answer:</p>

        <p>All samples except three got classified as BA.1 or sublineages thereof. BA.1 is the Omicron lineage that was dominant in South Africa when that new variant of concern was first discovered.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Again, this is straightforward to answer from the lineage summary:</p>

        <p>The three samples are <strong>SRR17051933</strong> (which got assigned to lineage B.1), and <strong>SRR17054505</strong> and <strong>SRR17054508</strong> (both of which pangolin left unassigned).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We have encountered <strong>SRR17054505</strong> and <strong>SRR17054508</strong> previously as samples with low sequencing coverage.</p>

        <p>When we ran pangolin, we used the default value for <em>“Maximum proportion of Ns allowed”</em> of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.3</code>.
If you look up the two samples in the original output of pangolin and scroll to the right, you should see that they have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fail</code> in the <strong>qc_status</strong> column and the <strong>qc_notes</strong> column explains that they had fractions of <em>Ambiguous content</em> (i.e. Ns) of 0.95 and 0.66, respectively.
In other words, pangolin refused (and rightly so) to perform lineage assignment for these two samples based on the very limited sequencing information available.</p>

        <p><strong>SRR17051933</strong>, on the other hand, has passed pangolin’s quality control with very low <em>Ambiguous content</em> so we might tend to believe the assignment.
However, if you remember earlier questions or re-inspect the variant-frequency plot generated by the reporting workflow, you will find that this sample was the outlier sample that had more or less the same mutations called as the other samples in the batch, but nearly all of them at rather low allele-frequencies.
In fact, the only seemingly fixed mutations (with allele-frequencies close to one) are ancestral mutations that have been present in SARS-CoV-2 isolates since the Spring of 2020.
Since only these mutations made it into the consensus sequence for that sample, pangolin has based the assignment only on them and has infered the ancestral lineage B.1 as a result.</p>

        <p>Whether or not this is the correct assignment for this sample is hard to tell without additional information.
Several possibilities exist:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the sample could indeed be from a pre-Omicron lineage and might have been lab-contaminated with DNA from one of the other (Omicron) samples processed together with it.</li>
          <li>the sample might have been taken from a patient who was infected with Omicron and a pre-Omicron lineage simultaneously.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Remember the questions about the outputs of the <em>reporting</em> workflow. As part of one of them, you were suggested to generate a report for mutations seen <em>only</em> in <strong>SRR17051933</strong>. It turned out that these were mostly observed at an allele frequency of ~ 0.75. This makes the first possibility seem somewhat more plausible: a pre-Omicron sample has been contaminated with traces of Omicron sequence, but most reads still come from the original strain. For the co-infection scenario, on the other hand, a lot would depend on the relative timing of the two infections.</p>
      </li>

<p>Nextclade assigns lineages using an algorithm that differs from the one used by pangolin, and it uses a different “native” nomenclature system. A nice feature of Nextclade, however, is that it can translate between its own clade system, PANGO lineage names and the more coarse-grained WHO classification system.</p>

<p>The details of and the rationale behind Nextclade “clade” assignment are explained in this <a href="https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/stable/user/algorithm/06-clade-assignment.html#clade-assignment">chapter of the Nextclade documentation</a>.</p>

  <div class="box-title question-title" id="question-3"><i class="far fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Question</div>

  <p>Which samples have been assigned differently by pangolin and Nextclade, and why?</p>

  <blockquote class="solution">
    <div class="box-title solution-title" id="solution-6"><button class="gtn-boxify-button solution" type="button" aria-controls="solution-6" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Solution</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

    <p><strong>SRR17054508</strong>, one of the two samples left unassigned by pangolin is assigned to BA.1 by Nextclade.</p>

    <p><strong>SRR17054505</strong>, the second sample left unassigned by pangolin is assigned to the recombinant lineage XAA by Nextclade.
Discovering a recombinant lineage (with two different Omicron parents) this early during the emergence of Omicron would, of course, be a spectacular find, if it was real. However, we already know from the discussion of coverage and pangolin results for this sample that this assignment cannot make sense.</p>

    <p>Nextclade simply doesn’t have pangolin’s concept of leaving samples unassigned, and this is why it produced (highly unreliable) assignments for both <strong>SRR17054508</strong> and <strong>SRR17054505</strong>.
However, if you inspect the original output of Nextclade, you’ll see that the tool classified both samples as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bad</code> in terms of their <strong>qc.overallStatus</strong>.
We could, thus, have used this column to filter out unreliable assignments to avoid the risk of overinterpreting the data.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion-and-outlook">Conclusion and outlook</h1>

<h2 id="what-we-have-covered">What we have covered</h2>

<p>In this tutorial, we used a collection of Galaxy workflows for the detection and interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 sequence variants.</p>

<p>The workflows can be freely used and are immediately accessible through global Galaxy instances.</p>

<p>Combined, they enable rapid, reproducible, high-quality and flexible analysis of a range of different input data.</p>

<p>The combined analysis flow is compatible with a high-throughput of samples, but still allows for detailed dives into effects seen in only particular samples, and enables qualified users to draw valid conclusions about individual samples and whole batches of data at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="further-automation">Further automation</h2>

<p>If at this point you are convinced of the quality of the analysis, but you are thinking that manually triggering those sequential workflow runs through the Galaxy user interface is still a lot of work when scaling to many batches of sequencing data, you may want to start learning about leveraging Galaxy’s API to automate and orchestrate workflow executions.
The GTN material has <a href="/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/workflow-automation/tutorial.html">a dedicated tutorial</a> that explains triggering workflow runs from the command line via the API.</p>

<p>The workflows presented here and API-based orchestration scripts are also among the main building blocks used by the Galaxy Covid-19 project to build a truly high-throughput, automated and reusable SARS-CoV-2 genome surveillance system, which has been used to analyze several hundreds of thousands of public SARS-CoV-2 sequencing datasets over the course of the pandemic and about which you can learn more on the corresponding <a href="https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/showcase/covid19-galaxy">Infectious Diseases Toolkit page</a>.</p>
