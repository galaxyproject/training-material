      Today we hear a lot about personalized medicine. Yet the personalization is defined by the genetic make up of the individual. In this tutorial we will discuss how this information can be uncovered from the genomic sequencing data.

  - title: Calling variants
    content: >-
      Variant calling is a complex field that was significantly propelled by advances in DNA sequencing and efforts of large scientific consortia such as the <a href="http://www.1000genomes.org/">1000 Genomes</a>. Here we summarize basic ideas central to Genotype and Variant calling. First, let’s contrast the two things although they often go together:<ul>
        <li><b>Variant calling</b> - identification of positions where the sequenced sample is different from the reference sequence (or <a href="https://github.com/vgteam/vg">reference genome graph</a>)</li>
        <li><b>Genotype calling</b> - identifying individual’s genotype at variable sites.</li></ul>
    backdrop: true
  - title: Calling variants
    content: >-
      A typical workflow for variation discovery involves the following steps (e.g., see Nielsen et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3593722/">2011</a>):<ul>
        <li>Mapping reads against the reference genome</li>
        <li>Thresholding BAM datasets by, for example, retaining paired, properly mapped reads</li>
        <li>Performing quality score recalibration</li>
        <li>Performing realignment</li>
        <li>Performing variant calling/genotype assignment</li>
        <li>Performing filtering and genotype quality score recalibration</li>
        <li>Annotating variants and performing downstream analyses</li>
      </ul>
      However, continuing evolution of variant detection methods has made some of these steps obsolete. For instance, omitting quality score recalibration and re-alignment (steps 3 and 4 above) when using haplotype-aware variant callers such as <a href="https://github.com/ekg/freebayes">FreeBayes</a> does not have an effect on the resulting calls (see Brad Chapman’s methodological comparisons at <a href="https://bit.ly/1S9kFJN">bcbio</a>). Before going forward with an actual genotype calling in Galaxy let’s take a look as some basic ideas behind modern variant callers.

      Consider a set of sequencing reads derived from a diploid individual
       <pre><code>REFERENCE:  atcatgacggcaGtagcatat
       --------------------------------
       READ1:     atcatgacggcaGtagcatat
       READ2:         tgacggcaGtagcatat

       The capitalized position contains a <b>G → A</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics)">transition</a>. So, in principle this can be a heterozygous site with two alleles <b>G</b> and <b>A</b>. A commonly used naïve procedure would define a site as heterozygous if there is a non-reference allele with frequency between 20% and 80%. In this case <b>A</b> is present in 1/5 or 20% of the cases, so we can say that this is a heterozygous site. Yet it is only represented by a single read and thus is hardly reliable. Here are some of the possibilities that would explain this variant. It can be:<ul>
         <li>a true variant</li>
         <li>an experimental artifact, e.g. a library preparation error</li>
         <li>a base calling error</li>
         <li>an analysis error, e.g. a misalignment (though unlikely in the above example)</li></ul>

      The modern variant callers attempt to assign a reliability estimate for each genotype call. This is done using Bayes reasoning (for a great visual explanation see <a href="https://oscarbonilla.com/2009/05/visualizing-bayes-theorem/">blog</a> by Oscar Bonilla).

      <a href="https://github.com/ekg/freebayes">FreeBayes</a> is an open source variant caller that has been battle-tested by the 1000 Genomes community and is extensively used today (also see <a href="https://bcbio.wordpress.com/">bcbio</a>). It has a number of features that simplify variant discovery workflows. These include (from FreeBayes github page):<ul>
        <li><b>Indel realignment is accomplished internally</b> using a read-independent method, and issues resulting from discordant alignments are dramatically reduced through the direct detection of haplotypes</li>
        <li><b>The need for base quality recalibration is avoided</b> through the direct detection of haplotypes. Sequencing platform errors tend to cluster (e.g. at the ends of reads), and generate unique, non-repeating haplotypes at a given locus</li>
        <li><b>Variant quality recalibration is avoided</b> by incorporating a number of metrics, such as read placement bias and allele balance, directly into the Bayesian model</li>
        <li><b>Ability to incorporate non-diploid cases</b> such as pooled datasets or data from polyploid samples.</li></ul>

      Freebayes is a <i>haplotype-based</i> variant caller. This implies that instead of looking at an individual positions within an alignment of reads to the reference genome, it looks at a haplotype window, length of which is dynamically determined (see section 3.2. in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.3907v2.pdf">FreeBayes manuscript</a>).

      In this example we will perform variant calling and annotation using <a href="https://jimb.stanford.edu/giab/">genome in the bottle data</a>. Specifically, we will use Ashkenazim Father-Mother-Son trio data from the Personal Genome Project:<ul>
        <li>HG002 - NA24385 - huAA53E0 (son)</li>
        <li>HG003 - NA24149 - hu6E4515 (father)</li>
        <li>HG004 - NA24143 - hu8E87A9 (mother)</li></ul>
      Yet for a quick tutorial these datasets are way too big, so we created a <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.60520">downsampled dataset</a>. This dataset was produced by mapping the trio reads against the <code>hg19</code> version of the human genome, merging the resulting bam files together (we use readgroups to label individual reads so they can be traced to each of the original individuals), and restricting alignments to a small portion of chromosome 19 containing the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?cmd=Retrieve&dopt=Graphics&list_uids=5442">POLRMT</a> gene.
