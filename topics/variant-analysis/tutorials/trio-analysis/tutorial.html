                <p>To discover causal mutations of inherited diseases it’s common practice to do a trio analysis. In a trio analysis DNA is sequenced of both the patient and parents. Using this method, it’s possible to identify multiple inheritance patterns. Some examples of these patterns are autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, and  de-novo variants, which are represented in the figure below. To elaborate, the most left tree shows an autosomal dominant inhertitance pattern where the offspring inherits a faulty copy of the gene from one of the parents. The center subfigure represents an autosomal recessive disease, here the offspring inherited a faulty copy of the same gene from both parents. In the right subfigure a de-novo mutation is shown, which is caused by a mutation during the offspring’s lifetime.</p>

<p>To discover these mutations either whole exome sequencing (WES) or whole genome sequencing (WGS) can be used. With these technologies it is possible to uncover the DNA of the parents and offspring to find (shared) mutations in the DNA. These mutations can include insertions/deletions (indels), loss of heterozygosity (LOH), single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number variations (CNVs), and fusion genes.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we will also make use of the HTSGET protocol, which is a program to download our data securely and savely. This protocol has been implemented in the <span class="tool" data-tool="toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/ega_download_client/pyega3/5.0.2+galaxy0" title="EGA Download Client tool" aria-role="button"><i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>EGA Download Client</strong> (<i class="fas fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> Galaxy version 5.0.2+galaxy0)</span> tool, so we don’t have to leave Galaxy to retrieve our data.</p>

<p>We will not start our analysis from scratch, since the main goal of this tutorial is to use the HTSGET protocol to download variant information from an online archive and to find the causative variant from those variants. If you want to learn how to do the analysis from scratch, using the raw reads, you can have a look at the <a href="/training-material/topics/variant-analysis/tutorials/exome-seq/tutorial.html">Exome sequencing data analysis for diagnosing a genetic disease</a> tutorial.</p>

<h1 id="data-preperation">Data preperation</h1>
<p>In this tutorial we will use case 5 from the RD-Connect GPAP synthetic datasets. The dataset that we will use consists of WGS VCFs from a real healthy family trio, which originates from the Illumina Platinum initiative <span class="citation"><a href="#Eberle2017">Eberle <i>et al.</i> 2017</a></span> and was made available by the <a href="https://www.genome.gov/10001688/international-hapmap-project">HapMap project</a>. In our dataset a real causative variant was manually spiked-in that should cause breast cancer. The spike-in has been synthetically introduced in the mother and daughter. Here our goal is to identify the genetic variation that is responsible for the disease.</p>

<p>We offer two ways to download the files. Firstly, you can download the files directly from the EGA-archive by requesting DAC access. This will take only 1 workday and gives you access to all of the RD-Connect GPAP synthetic datasets. However if you don’t have the time you can also download the data from zenodo.</p>

  <h2 id="getting-dac-access">Getting DAC access</h2>
  <p>Our test data is stored in EGA, which can be easily accessed using the EGA Download Client. Our specific EGA dataset accession ID is: “EGAD00001008392”. However, before you can access this data you need to request DAC access to this dataset. This can be requested by emailing to <a href="mailto:helpdesk@ega-archive.org">helpdesk@ega-archive.org</a>, don’t forget to mention the dataset ID! When the EGA grants you access it will create an account for you, if you don’t have it already. Next, you should link your account to your Galaxy account by going to the homepage on Galaxy and at the top bar click <strong>User &gt; Preferences &gt; Manage Information</strong>. Now add your email and password of your (new) EGA account under: <strong>Your EGA (european Genome Archive) account</strong>. After that you can check if you can log in and see if you have access to the dataset.</p>

<p>Before starting the analysis, the VCF files have to be pre-processed in order to meet input requirements of the tools which we will use for the downstream analysis.</p>

<h2 id="add-chromosome-prefix-to-vcf">Add chromosome prefix to vcf</h2>
<p>Firstly, our next tool has some assumptions about our input VCFs. The tool expects the chromosome numbers to start with a prefix <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chr</code>. Our VCFs only use the chromosome numbers however, the VCFs just use the chromosome numbers. This is due to a difference in reference genome used when creating the VCFs. To change the prefix in the VCFs we will use regex again.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The first check <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">^([0-9MYX])</code> &gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chr\1</code> adds the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chr</code> prefix to all the non-header line.

        <ul>
          <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">^</code> means that the pattern has to start at the beginning of the line not somewhere randomly in the line.</li>
          <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[0-9MYX]</code> means that at this position there should be a character from the list <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[]</code>, namely either a number from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0-9</code> or the character <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code>.</li>

<h2 id="normalizing-vcf">Normalizing VCF</h2>
<p>After adding the prefixes to the VCFs we need to normalize the variants in the VCF to standardize how the variants are represented within the VCF. This is a very important step, since the variants in the mother and daughter might be represented differently, which would mean that the causative variant might be overlooked!</p>

<p>One of the normalization steps is splitting multiallelic variants, 2 variants detected on the same position but on a different allele. Splitting these records will put the 2 variants on a separate line, that way the impact of the individual mutations can be evaluated. In addition, indels need to be left-aligned and normalized because that’s how they are stored in the annotation databases. An indel is left-aligned and normalized, according to <span class="citation"><a href="#Tan2015">Tan <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>, “if and only if it is no longer possible to shift its position to the left while keeping the length of all its alleles constant” and “if it is represented in as few nucleotides as possible”.</p>

<h2 id="filter-non_ref-sites">Filter NON_REF sites</h2>
<p>After normalizing the VCFs we will filter out the variants with a NON_REF tag in the ALT column, the column which represents the mutated nucleotide(s). According to the header, these sites correspond to: “any possible alternative allele at this location”. So these sites are a sort of placeholders for potential variants. However we are not interested in this kind of variants and they slow our analysis down quite a lot, so we will filter them out.</p>

<h2 id="gemini-analyses">GEMINI analyses</h2>
<p>Next, we will transform our VCF into a GEMINI database which makes it easier to query the VCFs and to determine different inheritence patterns between the mother, father, and offspring. In addition, GEMINI will add even more annotations to the variants. This allows us to filter the variants even more which gets us to closer to the real causative variant.
All these steps are performed by the <span class="tool" data-tool="toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/gemini_load/gemini_load/0.20.1+galaxy2" title="GEMINI load tool" aria-role="button"><i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>GEMINI load</strong> (<i class="fas fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> Galaxy version 0.20.1+galaxy2)</span> tool. However, before we can load the VCF we also need to define a pedigree file.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-pedigree-file-describing-the-family-trio">Create a pedigree file describing the family trio</h3>
<p>A pedigree file is a file that informs GEMINI which family members are affected by the disease and which sample name corresponds to what individual. This information is saved as a table containing information about the phenotype of the family.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>#family_id</strong>: Which family a row belongs to.</li>
  <li><strong>name</strong>: The name of the sample, note this sample name has to overlap with the sample name in the VCF, see the last 3 columns of the VCF. However, for some reason the VCF contains the sample name from case 6 and not case 5. This was probably just a typo in the VCF, however here we just copy the sample name to our pedigree file.</li>
  <li><strong>paternal_id</strong>: The sample name of the father or 0 for missing.</li>
  <li><strong>maternal_id</strong>: The sample name of the mother or 0 for missing.</li>
  <li><strong>sex</strong>: The sex of the person.</li>
  <li><strong>phenotype</strong>: Wether or not the person is affected by the disease.</li>

<p>Based on these findings it would make sense to start looking for inherited autosomal dominant variants as a first step.

<p>For this tool it is not required to set any filtering steps or determine the most plausible inheritence pattern. Since gene.iobio runs multiple default filtering steps for autosomal dominant, recessive, <em>De novo</em>, compound heterozygous, and X-linked recessive inheritance patterns. In addition, it prioritizes variants based on gene-disease association algorithms, which significantly reduces processing time.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this tutorial we have illustrated how to easily download a dataset of interest savely and securely from the EGA using the HTSGET protocol. In addition, we performed a trio analysis to find the causative variant in an autosomal dominant inherited disease. We pre-processed and annotated our VCFs using the SnpEff and found the causative variant using both the GEMINI and gene.iobio tool. With this workflow you can now easily analyse and find the causative variant(s) in many different family trios from any database which HTSGET can connect to.</p>

<h1 id="workflow">Workflow</h1>
<p>Here is the final layout of the workflow. For more details you can download the workflow from the overview at the top of the page.</p>

<figure id="figure-3" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/trio-analysis/workflow.png" alt="Image showing the whole workflow of the tutorial. Each seperate step is represented by a rectangular block with the tool name in the upper part in blue and the lower part shows the output in white. In the top left the workflow starts with the EGA Download Client which ouputs the authorized datasets (txt), below that again the EGA Download Client is shown which outputs the list of files in the ega dataset, which is connected to the search in textfiles tool. That tool is connected again to an EGA Download Client step where the VCFs are downloaded using the list of files from the previous tool. This step is connected to a decompress step to change the bgzipped VCFs to regular VCFs. That step is connected to a Filter step which outputs a VCF. The next connected step is the bcftools norm tool which outputs a normalized VCF. Then the normalized VCFs are processed using the Text reformatting tool. Using the output from that step the bcftools megre step is used to output a single VCF and connect it to the SnpEff eff tool. This tool annotates the VCF and that step is connected to the GEMINI load tool which is also connected to step block with the title pedigree. Then the GEMINI load tool connects to the GEMINI inheritance pattern block which outputs an tabular file called GEMINI autosomal_dominant pattern.
