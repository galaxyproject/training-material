<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<h3 id="finding-rare-variants">Finding rare variants</h3>

<p>Most popular variant callers focus on the common case of sequencing a diploid individual to find heterozygous and homozygous variants. This is a well-studied problem with its own challenges, but at least you can expect your variants to be present in either 100%, 50%, or 0% of your sample DNA. If you observe a variant present in 99%, 56%, or 2% of the reads at a site, you can probably assume the allele is actually present at 100%, 50%, or 0%, respectively, in your sample.</p>

<p>But in this tutorial, we’re looking for <strong>rare variants</strong>. So our true frequency might actually be 13%, 1%, or even 0.4%. The challenge then becomes distinguishing these situations from sequencing errors. Next-generation sequencers produce noise at this level, making it challenging to make this distinction in data produced with standard resequencing methods.</p>

<h3 id="duplex-sequencing">Duplex sequencing</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/109/36/14508.short">Duplex sequencing</a> is a method that addresses the problem of distinguishing sequencing signal from noise. It can increase sequencing accuracy by over four orders of magnitude. Duplex sequencing uses randomly generated oligomers to uniquely tag each fragment in a sample after random shearing. The tagged fragments are then PCR amplified prior to sequencing, so that many reads can be obtained from each original molecule. The tags in each read can then be used to identify which original fragment the read came from. Identifying multiple reads from each fragment allows building a consensus of the original sequence of the fragment, eliminating errors.</p>

<p>The key to duplex sequencing, as opposed to other types of consensus-based methods (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2017.117">review here</a>), is that both ends of the original fragment are tagged such that its strands can be distinguished. Knowing which strand each read comes from allows us to recognize errors even in the first round of PCR.</p>

<p>Processing the raw reads into consensus sequences consists of four main steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Group reads by their tags.</li>
  <li>Align reads in the same tag group.</li>
  <li>Build single-strand consensus sequences (<strong>SSCS</strong>) of reads coming from the same original strand.</li>
  <li>Build duplex consensus sequences (<strong>DCS</strong>) from pairs of SSCS.</li>
</ol>

<p>Du Novo is a tool which can carry out these steps. Unlike most other such tools, it can do so without the use of a reference sequence, and it can correct for errors in the tags which can contribute to data loss.</p>

<blockquote class="comment">
  <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-terminology"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment: Terminology</div>

  <p>Du Novo processes the tags from each fragment by concatenating them into a single <strong>barcode</strong>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>For a standard protocol with two 12bp tags, this results in a 24bp barcode which identifies each family.</li>
  </ul>

<p><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/109/36/14508.short">Schmitt <em>et al.</em> 2012</a> provides this overview of the whole method:

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The logic of duplex sequencing. The computational process is shown in part <strong>C</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="the-value-of-single-strand-consensus-sequences">The value of single-strand consensus sequences</h3>

<p>The DCSs have the ultimate accuracy, yet the SSCSs can also be very useful when ampliconic DNA is used as an input to a duplex experiment. Let us illustrate the utility of SSCSs with the following example. Suppose one is interested in quantifying variants in a virus that has a very low titer in body fluids. Since the duplex procedure requires a substantial amount of starting DNA (between <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4271547/">between 0.2 and 3 micrograms</a>) the virus needs to be enriched. This can be done, for example, with a PCR designed to amplify the entire genome of the virus. Yet the problem is that during the amplification heterologous strands will almost certainly realign to some extent forming heteroduplex molecules:</p>

<p><a href="../../images/het.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/het.png" alt="hd. " height="888" width="1210" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Heteroduplex formation in ampliconic templates. Image by Barbara Arbeithuber from <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1039-4">Stoler <em>et al.</em> 2016</a>. Here there are two distinct types of viral genomes: carrying <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">G</code>. Because the population of genomes is enriched via PCR, heteroduplex formation takes place, skewing frequency estimates performed using DCSs.</p>

<p>In the image above there are two alleles: green (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>) and red (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">G</code>). After PCR a fraction of molecules are in heteroduplex state. If this PCR-derived DNA is now used as the starting material for a DS experiment, the heteroduplex molecules will manifest themselves as having an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> base at this site (because Du Novo interprets disagreements as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code>s during consensus generation). So, DSCs produced from this dataset will have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">G</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> at the polymorphic site. Yet, SSCSs will only have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">G</code>. Thus SSCS will give a more accurate estimate of the allele frequency at this site in this particular case. In Du Novo SSCSs are generated when the <i class="far fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">param-check</span> <em>Output single-strand consensus sequences</em> option of <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">tool</span> <strong>Du Novo: Make consensus reads</strong> tool is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Yes</code> (see <a href="#making-consensus-sequences">below</a>).</p>

<h3 id="correcting-barcodes">Correcting barcodes</h3>

<p>The grouping reads based on barcode relies on exact barcode matches. Any PCR or sequencing error in the barcode sequence will prevent the affected reads from being joined with their other family members.</p>

<p>Du Novo includes a tool which can correct most of these errors and recover the affected reads. This can increase the final yield of duplex consensus reads by up to 11% (Stoler <em>et al.</em> 2018, in preparation).</p>

<h3 id="making-consensus-sequences">Making consensus sequences</h3>

<p>Now, we need to collapse the aligned reads into consensus sequences. This next tool will process each group of aligned reads that came from the same single-stranded family into a consensus.

<p>Normally, the tool only produces the final double-stranded consensus sequences. But we will make use of the single-stranded consensus sequences <a href="#calling-variants-with-single-strand-consensus-sequences">later</a>, so we’ll tell it to keep those as well.</p>

  <p>There is no easy way to assign a PHRED score to a consensus base derived from many duplex reads.</p>

  <p>So Du Novo does not attempt to give a meaningful score. It assigns the same arbitrary score to all bases.</p>

<h2 id="filtering-consensuses">Filtering consensuses</h2>

<p>You may have realized that when calling a “consensus” between two sequences, if the two disagree on a base, there’s no way to know which is correct. So in these situations, Du Novo uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_notation">IUPAC ambiguity letter</a> for the two different bases (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">W</code> = <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code>). Also, when calling single-stranded consensus sequences, if there aren’t enough high-quality bases to call a position (in the <a href="#hands-on-making-consensus-sequences">above hands-on</a>, we set this threshold to 70%), it gives an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code>.</p>

<p>This information could be useful for some analyses, but not for our variant calling. The tool <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">tool</span> <strong>Sequence Content Trimmer</strong> will help with filtering these out. With the settings below, it will move along the read, tracking the frequency of ambiguous (non-ACGT) bases in a 10bp window. If it sees more than 2 ambiguous bases in a window, it will remove the rest of the read, starting with the first offending base in the window. We’ll also tell it to remove entirely any read pair containing a read that got trimmed to less than 50bp.</p>

<p>At this point we have trimmed DCSs. We can now proceed to call variants. This involves aligning the variants against the reference genome, then counting variants.</p>

<p>We’re not specifically interested in the reference sequence, since all we care about is sequence content of the consensus reads. But we’ll be using the reference sequence to figure out where all the reads come from. This lets us stack them on top of each other, with equivalent bases lined up in columns. Then we can step through each column, count how many times we see each base, and and compile a list of variants.</p>

<h2 id="calling-the-variants">Calling the variants</h2>

<p>Now we’ll use our aligned consensus reads to find variants.</p>

<p>Normally, in a diploid resequencing experiment, you would call variants relative to the reference. So, you’d report sites which are different from the reference (and whether they’re hetero- or homozygous).</p>

<p>In our case, we’re interested in <em>rare</em> variants. So what we’ll report is the sites where there is more than one allele, and what the frequency is of the less-common allele (the <strong>minor allele</strong>). This has the potential to include every small sequencing error (even though we’re using duplex, there still are errors). So to reduce the noise, we’ll set a lower threshold at 1% minor allele frequency (<strong>MAF</strong>).</p>
