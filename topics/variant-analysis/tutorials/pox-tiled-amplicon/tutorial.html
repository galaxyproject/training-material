                <p>Pox viruses (<em>Poxviridae</em>) are a large family of viruses, and members of it have various vertebrate and arthropod species as their natural hosts. The most widely known species in the family are the now extinct variola virus from the genus <em>orthopoxvirus</em> as the cause of smallpox, and vaccinia virus, a related, likely horsepox virus, which served as the source for the smallpox vaccine that allowed eradication of that disease.</p>

<p>However, various other pox viruses infect mammalian hosts and cause often severe diseases, and some of them have the ability to jump to humans. Mpox, caused by monkeypox virus, is the most recent and prominent example demonstrating the zoonotic potential of <em>orthopoxviruses</em>. The sister genus <em>capripoxvirus</em> is a major concern in livestock farming with all its three species - sheeppox virus (SPPV), goatpox virus (GTPV), and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) causing severe disease <a href="https://www.woah.org/en/disease/sheep-pox-and-goat-pox/">in sheep and goats</a> (SPPV, GTPV) and <a href="https://www.woah.org/en/disease/lumpy-skin-disease/">in cattle</a> (LSDV).</p>

<p>All pox viruses are characterized by a large double-stranded DNA genome (genome sizes of currently sequenced species range from 135 to 360kb) that gets replicated exclusively in the cytoplasm of host cells.</p>

<p>The ends of pox virus genomes consist of inverted terminal repeats (ITRs), i.e. regions of exact reverse-complementarity at the 5â- and 3â-end of the genome. At the very tips of the genome, these regions contain tandem repeats and terminal bases that are cross-linked to the opposite genome strand as first described for vaccinia virus and reviewed in <span class="citation"><a href="#Wittek1982">Wittek 1982</a></span>.</p>

<p>There is considerable length variation in the ITR regions of different species. For example, Capripox virus genomes have ITR lengths of 2.2 - 2.4 kb, monkeypox virus has 6.4 kb long ITRs, and variola virus had the shortest known
ITRs with a length of just 700 bases (reviewed in <span class="citation"><a href="#Haller2014">Haller <i>et al.</i> 2014</a></span>).</p>

<p>Independent of their size, ITRs pose a problem for the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data of pox viruses. Their repetitive nature can confuse de-novo assembly algorithms, but is, to some extent, also a challenge during reference-based mapping, particularly at the boundary between ITRs and the central region of the genome and with samples less related to the reference.</p>

<p>Recently, a tiled-amplicon approach with separate sequencing of half-genomes has been developed for <em>capripoxviruses</em> (<span class="citation"><a href="#Mathijs2022">Mathijs <i>et al.</i> 2022</a></span>) that makes it possible to assign ITR-derived reads unambiguously to the 5â- or 3â-end of a pox virus genome when combined with a suitable bioinformatics pipeline.</p>

<p>This tutorial demonstrates how such data can be analyzed correctly with Galaxy.</p>

  <p>This tutorial demonstrates a very close to real-world analysis of viral sequencing data with Galaxy<sup id="fnref:prior_work" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:prior_work" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.
As such, it avoids many simplifications that are often made in training material to ease understanding.
On the technical side, in particular, it makes use of many different Galaxy features and often assumes more than just basic familiarity with them.
Like in other tutorials, you will find precise instructions for running every step in the analysis, but explanations focus very much on the biology of pox viruses and will often not offer much details on <em>why</em> a certain component of Galaxy is used the way it is described.</p>

  <p>To get the most out of this tutorial, you should have worked through several other parts of the training material, which are listed under <strong>Requirements</strong> above, in particular:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you are not yet familiar with
      <ul>
        <li>some typical ways of getting data into Galaxy,</li>
        <li>dataset collections and ways to manipulate them</li>
        <li>importing and running workflows,</li>
      </ul>

      <p>you may benefit more from this tutorial if you first follow some of the introductory tutorials on these topics.</p>

      <p>The tutorial also uses the rule-based uploader, which is an advanced feature, and treats it very much like a black box, which somehow lets you structure data exactly the way it is needed for the analysis. If you want to learn how to use this powerful feature for your own purposes, please follow the dedicated tutorials <a href="/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/upload-rules/tutorial.html">Rule Based Uploader</a> and <a href="/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/upload-rules-advanced/tutorial.html">Rule Based Uploader Advanced</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>If this is your first exposure to sequencing data analysis, our more basic tutorials on quality control and mapping of such data are highly recommended to get you familiar with general concepts, data types, etc.</li>
  </ul>

<p>The following figure provides an overview of the wet lab data generation process described in <span class="citation"><a href="#Mathijs2022">Mathijs <i>et al.</i> 2022</a></span> and of the flow of the analysis that we will perform in this tutorial.</p>

<figure id="figure-1" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/pox-virus-tiled-amplicon/pox-tiled-amplicon-wf.png" alt="A schematic drawing of a pox virus genome with a central coding region flanked by inverted terminal repeat regions. Below the genome 23 tiled amplicons are drawn as numbered lines to show their approximate distribution across the genome. Below the amplicons, the main steps in their wet lab processing and of the bioinformatics analysis of their sequences is shown as a flowchart.

<p>On the wet lab side, the genome of a viral sample gets amplified in the form of 23 overlapping amplicons using a set of pan-genus primers suitable for all species of <em>capripoxvirus</em>.</p>

<p>Amplification happens in four separate multiplex PCR reactions: the primers for the odd-numbered amplicons (1-11) from the 5â amplicon pool are used in reaction 1a, the primers for the even-numbered amplicons (2-12) in reaction 1b, the odd-numbered amplicons (13-23) from the 3â amplicon pool in reaction 2a and the even numbered amplicons (12-22) from that pool in reaction 2b.</p>

<p>Note that the 5â-ITR gets amplified as part of amplicon 1, while the 3â-ITR is part of amplicon 23. Amplification of the two regions is specific because the right primer of amplicon 1 and the left primer of amplicon 23 both bind in the âcentral coding regionâ, i.e. outside the reverse-complementary ITRs.</p>

<p>After amplification, reactions 1a and 1b, and reactions 2a and 2b are combined to form the two sequencing pools, âpool 1â and âpool 2â. Note that amplicon 12 becomes part of both tools in the published protocol because overlap between the two sequencing pools is required for assembly-based analysis. For the mapping-based approach shown in this tutorial the overlap is not essential.</p>

<p>The DNA from the two pools is subjected separately to Illumina sequencing. This way, reads obtained from sequencing of âpool 1â are known to be derived from the 5â-half of the genome, while reads obtained from sequencing of âpool 2â are known to originate from the 3â-half.</p>

<p>In the tutorial analysis, we will exploit this information and map the âpool 1â data to a modified reference genome, in which the 3â-half of the sequence has been replaced with Ns. This masking prevents the read mapper from placing ambiguous reads (in particular reads derived from the 5â-ITR region) onto the 3â-half of the genome.
Likewise, we will use a 5â-masked genome for the mapping of the âpool 2â reads, again preventing erroneous mapping of reads that we know must be derived from the 3â-half of the genome.</p>

<p>Once the correct alignments of the reads from the two pools have been recorded, we can safely merge the two results, and use that merged data to construct a consensus sequence for the sample.</p>

<p>Compared to a standard tiled-amplicon approach involving just one sequencing pool, the half-genome sequencing approach is more accurate, especially at the boundaries between the âcentral coding regionâ and the ITRs, but the analysis is complicated by the doubled number of inputs, by the need to generate masked reference sequences and by the extra step of merging two read mapping results.</p>

<h2 id="get-reference-and-sequenced-samples-data">Get reference and sequenced samples data</h2>

<p>In this tutorial you are going to work on the sequencing data from two samples of lumpy skin disease virus that have been sequenced as amplified half-genomes in Illumina paired-end mode. This means that we will be dealing with a forward and a reverse read dataset per sample and amplified half-genome, and so will have to download a total of eight sequenced reads datasets for our analysis.</p>

<p>The samples are the first two (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SAMN20238786</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SAMN20238785</code>) from BioProject <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PRJNA746718</code> as found through the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA746718">European Nucleotide Archive browser</a>.</p>

<p>If you follow the link, you should see that</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>for each of the two samples there is data from two sequencing runs (representing the two sequenced half-genome pools of amplicons).</p>

    <p>If it isnât shown by default, enable display of the <em>Library Name</em> column by clicking on <em>Show Column Selection</em> and selecting the checkbox for <em>library_name</em>. The pool identity (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code>) is provided as the last part of each sequencing runâs library name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for each pool the data consists of two downloadable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fastq.gz</code> results files, which represent the forward and reverse reads for that sequencing run.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="comment">
  <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-choice-of-samples"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment: Choice of samples</div>
  <p>An in-depth analysis (<span class="citation"><a href="#Vandenbussche2022">Vandenbussche <i>et al.</i> 2022</a></span>) of the samples from BioProject PRJNA746718 has revealed that their genomes are the result of recombination between at least two different parent strains.
So not only are these samples sequenced following our wet lab protocol of choice, but there is also some prior knowledge about their (rather interesting) biology.
This gives us the opportunity to evaluate the correctness of our analysis by comparing the results we will generate in this tutorial to the published findings.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In addition, we will require:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a <strong>reference genome</strong> to map the sequenced reads to</p>

    <p>We will be using the public lumpy skin disease virus reference sequence <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_003027.1/">NC_003027.1</a> from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/">NCBI RefSeq</a> database here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a <strong>primer scheme file</strong> with information about</p>
    <ul>
      <li>which amplicons were present in which half-genome sequencing pool</li>
      <li>where each primer binds with respect to the reference genome</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is a custom file, which you may have to modify, when analysing your own data, depending on the actual primer scheme used during sample preparation, and which we will just copy/paste into Galaxy. The version we are using describes the binding sites of the 46 primers published by (<span class="citation"><a href="#Mathijs2022">Mathijs <i>et al.</i> 2022</a></span>) with respect to the NC_003027.1 reference sequence.</p>

      <li>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#pool1</code> name tag should be attached to the collection in the history.</li>

  <li>The collection of pool 2 reads (representing the 3â-half of the genome)

  </li>
  <li>The LSDV reference as a single <em>fasta</em> dataset</li>
  <li>The primer scheme as a single <em>bed</em> dataset</li>

<p>If this is the case for you, you are ready to start the actual data analysis.</p>

<h1 id="generating-masked-reference-genome-versions-for-mapping">Generating masked reference genome versions for mapping</h1>

<p>As illustrated in Figure 1, we would like to map the âpool 1â reads of each sample to a version of the LSDV reference, in which the 3â-half of the genome (starting after the right end of amplicon 12, the 3â-most amplicon still contained in pool 1) is masked (i.e., bases are replaced by Ns). This ensures that the read mapper will only consider the 5â-half of the genome when placing reads from pool 1.
Likewise, for the âpool2â read mapping, we would like to use a reference version, in which the 5â-half that is not covered by the second amplicon pool is masked out.</p>

<p>To build these two masked reference versions we need to extract the information about amplicon pool boundaries from the primer scheme BED dataset and use it twice on the LSDV reference to replace the appropriate ranges of its bases with Ns.</p>

<p>As this is a complex task that would take a considerable amount of time to perform step-by-step via manual tool runs, we are providing a pre-built workflow for you that you only need to import and run on the input data in your history.</p>

          <p>The masked reference for mapping of pool1 has Ns from 80,202 - 150,773.
The 3â-most primer contained in pool1, CaPV-V1_12_RIGHT, has its binding site listed as 80,176 - 80,202.
Bed format specifies zero-based half-open intervals, i.e. the first base of a sequence has position 0, and the end position of any interval is the first base <em>not</em> included in it!
So the 3â-most base covered by the primer is base number 80,201 (when counting from 0) and the reference is masked correctly from 80,202 onwards.</p>

          <p>The masked reference for mapping of pool2 has Ns from 0 - 72,534.
The 5â-most primer of pool2 is CaPV-V1_12_LEFT and the primer scheme lists the start of its binding site as 72,534.
Again, the way bed format is specified means that position 72,534 is the first base <em>not</em> masked in the reference for pool2 mapping, and that is correct.
Also note that amplicon 12 is contained in both pools and the masking takes this fact into account.</p>

          <p>Feel free to open the workflow in the workflow editor and inspect the steps it took to work out the masking, but itâs also ok to treat this part as a black box and move on. There is still a lot of analysis that is waiting to be done.</p>

<h1 id="quality-control-of-the-sequencing-data-of-all-samples">Quality control of the sequencing data of all samples</h1>

<p>The next step is to check the quality of the sequencing data of both samples and to eliminate, if necessary, poor-quality reads or parts of them.</p>

<p>The tool <strong>fastp</strong> lets us perform these tasks and obtain a nice quality report for our reads before and after processing in one go, but many other options exist to perform sequenced reads quality control and trimming/filtering in Galaxy, and the dedicated tutorial on <a href="/training-material/topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.html">quality control</a> introduces more of them.</p>

        <p>fastp comes with basic default settings for some of its many parameters.
In particular, with no explicit parameter specifications, the tool will still remove reads that</p>
        <ul>
          <li>have base qualities &lt; 15 for more than 40% of their bases</li>
          <li>have more than 5 Ns in their sequence</li>
          <li>
            <p>have a length &lt; 15 bases (after removing poly-G tails from Illumina reads)</p>

            <p>Because our input data has far longer MiSeq-generated reads, we can increase this length threshold to 30 bases as done above.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>These are very relaxed criteria that will only remove the least usable reads, but still assure minimal
quality standards that are good enough for many (including training) purposes.</p>

<h1 id="mapping-to-the-masked-reference-genomes">Mapping to the masked reference genomes</h1>

<p>We are now ready to map each pool of each sample to the corresponding masked reference. We will use the tool BWA-MEM with essentially default settings for this purpose. As shown in figure 1, however, we want to merge the mapping results afterwards, but still be able to tell mapped reads from pool 1 and pool 2 apart. To this end, we need to tag reads with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pool1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pool2</code> read group identifiers, respectively, at the mapping step. Just because a sample has pool1 and pool2 reads it is still just one sample though, and we are going to express that fact through a common sample name (which we let BWA-MEM autodetect as the name of the collection elements).</p>

<h1 id="merging-the-mapped-reads-of-both-pools">Merging the mapped reads of both pools</h1>

<p>We have mapped both pool 1 and pool 2 reads to masked versions of the same reference sequence. This means that any mapping in any of the separate BWA-MEM outputs also describes a valid mapping to the complete, unmasked reference so all we need to do is merge the pool 1 and pool 2 mapped reads datasets of each sample into one to obtain complete mapping results for the entire genome of the sample.</p>

<p>A tool that can perform this task for us is <strong>samtools merge</strong>. However, if we gave this tool our collection of pool1 reads with one BAM dataset per sample and the collection of pool2 reads with again one BAM dataset per sample, you would be very disappointed to see that it would merge all datasets into one, i.e. it would not only combine pools, but also sample data, which is not what we want.</p>

<p>Why does <strong>samtools merge</strong> in Galaxy behave like this? Well, the tool is written so that it knows how to merge multiple datasets <em>and</em> it knows how to merge the contents of simple collections - and itâs just too eager to apply that knowledge. What we can do, however, is try and pass it something it does <em>not</em> know how to handle in a single run, and thatâs a nested collection. So instead of providing the input as two separate collections (one for pool1 and one for pool2 data) that each hold two elements (representing data from one sample), we want to provide a collection of two samples, each one consisting of a collection of pool 1 and pool 2 reads, in turn.
When we do this, Galaxy will recognize that the tool cannot handle this, but that it would know how to handle each outer element (sample) separately (as a simple collection). In this situation, Galaxy will automatically schedule two parallel excutions of the tool for us, each one receiving one element of the outer collection as input.</p>

<p>We can do the necessary restructuring in two steps, then pass the result to <strong>samtools merge</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="mapped-reads-filtering-trimming-and-qc">Mapped reads filtering, trimming, and QC</h1>

<p>So now that we have one dataset of mapped reads per sample, we will do some cleaning and quality control on the mapped data to be sure we pass only reliable mapping data into consensus calling.</p>

<p>We will first use <strong>samtools view</strong> to discard any alignments that we are not fully confident in.</p>

<p>Next, we will run <strong>ivar trim</strong> on the retained reads. This tool can detect primer sequences at the ends of the mapped reads that represent the tiled amplicon primers used during preparation of the samples for sequencing, and will mask them so that they will not be considered during generation of the consensus sequence.</p>

<blockquote class="details">
  <div class="box-title details-title" id="details-primer-trimming"><button class="gtn-boxify-button details" type="button" aria-controls="details-primer-trimming" aria-expanded="true"><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Details: Primer trimming</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p>The primers used for the tiled-amplicon generation will get incorporated physically at the start and end of each amplicon. These ends, therefor, do <em>not</em> represent amplified sequence from the sample genome, but merely reflect the primer sequences. Consequently, the amplicon ends will never capture any mutations in the genome region they cover, and we cannot meaningfully use them for building a consensus sequence for the sample.</p>

  <p>Luckily, since we are dealing with <em>tiled</em> (i.e., overlapping) amplicons, each amplicon end should be overlapped by the non-primer part of another amplicon, and we can use these sequences to obtain information about the sequenced sample at primer binding sites. By masking parts of reads that are derived from incorporated primers, we make sure these âpseudoâ-sequences are not interfering with mutation detection based on truly informative reads, and that we can faithfully reconstruct the genome of the sample.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Finally, we will use <strong>Qualimap BamQC</strong> to generate a quality report on the trimmed and filtered mapped reads, which weâll inspect to judge whether read mapping worked well enough for consensus generation purposes.</p>

            <li>Mean coverage for sample 20L81 is 2,073, for 20L70 it is 2,155.</li>
            <li>
              <p>Despite its slightly higher mean coverage, sample 20L70 has the slightly worse coverage <em>distribution</em>.</p>

              <p>The âCoverage across referenceâ plot shows higher variability of coverage for this sample.
While it peaks at higher values, it also drops below a coverage of 500 more clearly and in more regions across the genome than 20L81, and even drops to potentially problematically low values in a short stretch of sequence just after the middle of the genome.
The âCoverage Histogramâ plot also reveals that the coverage distribution for 20L70 is a bit skewed towards lower values than that for 20L81.</p>

              <p>All these effects are not very dramatic and should not prevent us from continuing with the analysis of both samples. We should watch out for a potentially incomplete consensus sequence in that low-coverage stretch of the 20L70 genome though.</p>

            <li>Mapping quality is almost constant at or very near 60 (which happens to be the maximum mapping quality value emitted by BWA-MEM) across the entire genome for both samples.

<h1 id="consensus-sequence-construction">Consensus sequence construction</h1>

<p>And with that we are ready for consensus sequence generation!</p>

<p>To accept any base suggested by the mapped sequenced reads as the consensus base for the corresponding genome position, we ask for the following requirements to be fulfilled:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at least 20 sequenced reads have to provide information about the base in question</li>
  <li>at a minimum, 70% of these reads have to agree on the base at this position (80% for indels)</li>
</ul>

<p>To avoid getting misled too much by sequencing errors, we are also going to ignore bases with a base calling quality less than 20 in the above counts (i.e., we are going to base our decisions only on bases in sequenced reads that the basecaller of the sequencer was reasonably sure about.</p>

<p>Now what if we cannot obtain a consensus base for a position with the above criteria? In such cases of uncertainty we want to insert an N (i.e. an unknown base) to express that we either did not have enough information about the position or that this information was ambiguous.</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">galaxy-info</span> All of the above limits for consensus base calling are arbitrary to some degree, and depend somewhat on the quality of the sequencing data. With very high overall coverage, for example, it is possible to increase the coverage threshold, but if you increase that threshold too much, you may end up with a consensus sequence consisting mostly of Ns.</p>

          <p>Certainly both sequences start and end with stretches of Ns.</p>

          <p>Since the sequencing data is ampliconic in nature, and the primer scheme lists the first and the last primer as binding close to but not exactly at the end of the genome, it is expected that we cannot resolve the first and last couple of hundreds bases.</p>

          <p>However, to determine whether those terminal stretches of Ns are exactly as long as we expect them to be would be a tedious task to perform manually. Likewise, it is not trivial to assert that there are no additional Ns somewhere in these long sequences.</p>

          <p>The tool reports only two stretches consisting of Ns at both ends of the genome, and their positions are exactly identical between the samples. There are no interior Ns, nor other ambiguity characters.</p>

          <p>The 5â-end stretch of Ns extends up to position 264 (in bed format, so zero-based and the position itself not included). The binding site of the first primer in the primer scheme is from (bed format again) 235 up to 264.</p>

          <p>Remember that we used ivar trim to mask primer sequences? This seems to have worked well, and we got a consensus sequence from the first position for which we could reasonably expect information!</p>

          <p>The 3â-end stretch of Ns starts at position 150,453 and continues (as we have seen by eye before) until the end of the genome, which seems to be at 150,721.
Hmm, these values are surrounding the binding site of the last primer in the primer scheme, but do not match perfectly. But wait:</p>

          <p>It is possible that the consensus sequences incorporate deletions, i.e. it could be that they are shorter than the reference we have used for mapping. So obviously the <strong>consensus sequences have a length of 150,721 bases</strong>, but what is the length of the reference?</p>

          <p>There are Galaxy tools for determining the length of a FASTA sequence. For example, you could use <span class="tool" data-tool="toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/fasta_compute_length/fasta_compute_length/1.0.3" title="Compute sequence length tool" aria-role="button"><i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Compute sequence length</strong> (<i class="fas fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> Galaxy version 1.0.3)</span> on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LSDV reference</code> dataset, but we have obtained the value before when we used the <strong>Fasta regular expression finder</strong> on the reference masked for pool 1 mapping. So lets try to find that output in the history and see what it says:</p>

          <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Chrom         Start    End       Name                           Score    Strand    ThickStart
AF325528.1    80201    150773    AF325528.1_80201_150773_for    70572    +         N[1,70572]
</code></pre></div>          </div>

          <p>is what the tool reported for the 3â-mask so <strong>the reference is 150,773 bases</strong> long.</p>

          <p>Now, 150,773 - 150,721 = 52 is how many bases the consensus sequences are shorter than the reference,
and on these shorter sequences the binding site of the 3â-most primer would be shifted from 150,505 - 150,538 on the reference to 150,453 - 150, 486.</p>

          <p>Again primer masking by ivar trim will cause the primer sequence itself to be ignored during consensus sequence building so we can expect the sequence to be resolved up to position 150,453 and this is exactly where the trailing Ns start.</p>

          <p>Consensus building seems to have worked perfectly, with no interior Ns and the maximal sequence resolved!</p>

<h2 id="confirmation-of-published-findings">Confirmation of published findings</h2>

<p>Even a perfectly looking consensus sequence could, of course, have wrong bases incorporated. Also, a consensus sequence on its own does not convey too much information.</p>

<p>So the next question is if the sequences we have generated make sense when compared to other sequences.</p>

<p>Figure 2 in (<span class="citation"><a href="#Vandenbussche2022">Vandenbussche <i>et al.</i> 2022</a></span>) illustrates that our two samples (third-last and fourth-last alignment records in both panels A and B) have a mosaic genome composed of recombined sequences from at least two different parent strains, and as a plausibility check we can try to reproduce this finding.</p>

<p>For this, we will need to create a multiple-sequence alignment (MSA) between our consensus sequences and the assumed parent strains used in the figure. The assumed parent P2 (with accesion number KX683219), however, is very closely related to the reference we have used for mapping here so we can simply use that already obtained sequence instead of parent P2.</p>

<p>This leaves us with the tasks of obtaining the sequence for parent P1 (accession number: KX764644) and of combining this sequence, our reference and our two consensus sequences into an MSA.</p>

<p>From here on, there exist different possibilities to compare the aligned sequences. Two of them that work right inside Galaxy and do not require additional tools or skills are:</p>

  <li>using the tool <strong>faToVcf</strong> to turn the MSA into a list of mutations with regard to one of the parents</li>

        <li>
          <p>in the <em>ALT</em> column lists what has been observed instead of <em>REF</em> in at least one of the other samples</p>

          <p>Because we had activated <em>âInclude positions without defined ALT alleleâ</em> the tool has produced result lines also for cases, in which other sequences have a gap or an N at that position, and both situations are represented by a <strong>*</strong> in the <em>ALT</em> column</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>has sample-specifc columns at the end</p>

          <p>These columns provide information about which allele is seen for a specific sample at the reference position.</p>

          <p>If a sample shows, at a position in the MSA, the same base as the reference the value in that sampleâs column will be a <strong>0</strong>. If itâs showing the base in the <em>ALT</em> column instead, the value will be a <strong>1</strong>. If the position in the sample is a gap or a N (in which case the <em>ALT</em> column will have a <strong>*</strong>), the value in the sample-specific column will be a <strong>.</strong>.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>With this information now scroll through the file and compare whatâs listed to the published figure.</p>

          <p>The output of faToVcf starts with lines that have dots in the columns for the two consensus sequences.
These correspond to the leading Ns in those sequences.</p>

          <p>The rest of the output (up to the trailing Ns) appears mostly as blocks, in which the two consensus sequences either look like AF325528.1, or they donât.
If you compare those blocks to the figure, youâll see that they correspond very nicely to the blue and white regions in it. So, yes, our consensus sequences confirm the same mosaic pattern.</p>

          <p>When looking for lines corresponding to the red and green features of the figure, i.e. for deletions and insertions, please note that the output of faToVcf is limited to deletions with respect to the reference.
Since the tool only emits lines for positions in the reference, it will never include insertions relative to it.
To have those listed, you would have to run the tool again with AF325528.1 as the reference, then look for deletions (which would correspond to insertions with respect to KX764644.1).</p>

<h2 id="comparison-of-consensus-sequences-to-published-sequences">Comparison of consensus sequences to published sequences</h2>

<p>If you paid close attention up to this point you may have spotted the MZ** prefixes on the aligned sequences of the published figure 2. These turn out to be NCBI Genbank identifiers. So all these sequences have already been submitted to a public database!</p>

<p>This means that as the last and ultimate check of our consensus sequences we can directly compare them to the public sequences - something you would, of course, not be able to do for your own samples.</p>

<p>Instead of downloading the Genbank sequences into Galaxy and running yet another alignment job, we will take a shortcut this time and just do a BLAST of our consensus sequences using the public NCBI BLAST service:</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <div class="box-title hands-on-title" id="hands-on-ncbi-blast-of-consensus-sequences"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Hands-on: NCBI BLAST of consensus sequences</div>

  <ol>
    <li>Click on the collection of generated consensus sequences in your history; output of <strong>ivar consensus</strong></li>
    <li>Inside the collection, <i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">galaxy-eye</span> display the consensus sequence of sample 20L81</li>
    <li>In the middle panel, which should now display the sequence, use the mouse to select the whole sequence except for the leading and trailing Ns (those would not be helpful in any way in the BLAST search), then copy the selection to the clipboard with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd></li>
    <li>Head over to the <a href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE=MegaBlast&amp;PROGRAM=blastn">NCBI BLAST</a> service, paste the copied content into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Enter Query Sequence</code> text box  and click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BLAST</code> at the bottom of the form</li>
    <li>Wait for the <em>BLAST</em> run to finish</li>
    <li>
      <p>Inspect the results</p>

      <p>In the top section, take note of the <strong>Query Length</strong> reported by BLAST. This is the length of the sequence you copied over from Galaxy and should be 150,189.</p>

      <p>Then proceed to the table of BLAST hists.
<strong>Lumpy skin disease virus strain 20L81_Bang-Thanh/VNM/20</strong> should be very near the top of the list.
By clicking on the name of the sequence you can jump directly to the alignment between your consensus sequence (the BLAST <em>Query</em>) and that sequence (the BLAST <em>Subject</em>).</p>

      <p>Just above that alignment its statistics are displayed and say that the 150,189 bases in our input have been aligned with 100% identity to the subject!
The MZ577076.1 Genbank sequence is reported to have a length of 150,664 bases so is almost 500 bases longer than our consensus, but we established already that our consensus sequence has the maximum length that is to be expected with the primer scheme used in the tiled-amplicon approach.</p>

      <p>So looks like we have done a really good job!</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

</blockquote>

<p>What about the consensus sequence for 20L70? Well, as another shortcut if you head back to the table of BLAST hits (navigate to the very top of the current alignment view and click <strong>Descriptions</strong> at the top right to return to the table), you should find 20L70 as a hit really close to the one for 20L81. Turns out it is an equally perfect hit to our 20L81 sequence, which means that the public sequences for the two samples are identical at least in the part that we have determined the sequence for.</p>

<p>So if our 20L70 consensus is identical to the published 20L70 sequence, it should also be identical to our 20L81 sequence. One way to confirm the identity of two sequences is to calculate checksums for both of them and see if they match. Obtaining a checksum of an entire dataset is possible in Galaxy with the tool <strong>Secure Hash / Message Digest</strong>, but makes limited sense when the goal is to compare FASTA sequences as these will typically differ in the sequence title line, can have different line breaks structure in the sequence part, or differ in case of any number of bases. Thatâs why a specialized tool is needed that only compares the sequences themselves.</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <div class="box-title hands-on-title" id="hands-on-checking-two-sequences-for-identity"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Hands-on: Checking two sequences for identity</div>

  <ol>
    <li><span class="tool" data-tool="toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/wolma/mimodd_main/mimodd_info/0.1.8_1" title="MiModD File Information tool" aria-role="button"><i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>MiModD File Information</strong> (<i class="fas fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> Galaxy version 0.1.8_1)</span>

      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

</blockquote>

<p>The outputs of the tool should confirm that both sequences have a length of 150,721 bases (Ns included) and identical md5 checksums!</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>We have reached the end of this tutorial, in which we have introduced a lot of tools of general usefulness for viral sequence data analysis. We have also touched on several Galaxy features - collections, workflows, rule-based uploads, visualizations - that let you handle any number of samples and rather complex structured input data like half-genome sequenced samples, with two pairs of forward and reverse reads per sample, with relative ease.</p>

<p>We were able to generate high-quality pox virus consensus genomes and explore them in different ways right in Galaxy. Many of the concepts and techniques you have seen in this tutorial are useful also in analysis of other data - certainly for data from other pox viruses like monkeypox, but much could be reapplied to other viruses.</p>
