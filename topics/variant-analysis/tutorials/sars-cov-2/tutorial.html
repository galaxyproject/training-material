<h2 id="find-obtain-and-filter-information-about-public-sequencing-data">Find, obtain and filter information about public sequencing data</h2>

<p>First we need to find some good, public datasets to play with.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra">Sequence Read Archive (SRA)</a> is the primary archive of <em>unassembled reads</em>  operated by the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">US National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a>.
SRA is a great place to get the sequencing data that underlie publications and studies.
The study we are interested in for this tutorial is one on sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates that were obtained in the Boston area in the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic (<span class="citation"><a href="#Lemieux2021">Lemieux <i>et al.</i> 2021</a></span>).</p>

<p>So lets see how we can find its raw data in the SRA, and how we can get some of that data into Galaxy to analyze it. The Acknowledgments section of the publication mentions that raw reads from the study have been deposited in the SRA under <strong>BioProject PRJNA622837</strong> so that’s going to be our starting point.</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <div class="box-title hands-on-title" id="hands-on-find-the-example-data-in-the-sra"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Hands-on: Find the example data in the SRA</div>

  <ol>
    <li>Go to NCBI’s SRA page by pointing your browser to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra</a></li>
    <li>
      <p>In the search box enter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PRJNA622837[BioProject]</code></p>

      <p>Oh, this finds a <em>lot</em> of samples (more than 22,000 at the time of writing)!
This is because the BioProject ID we used is that of “SARS-CoV-2 Patient Sequencing from the Broad Institute”, which has seen many more sample submissions since the published study.
Let’s refine our search a bit.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Replace your previous search with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PRJNA622837[BioProject] AND RNA-Seq[Strategy]</code></p>

      <p>This returns only those samples from the BioProject, for which the sequencing strategy was RNA-Seq.</p>

      <p>At the time of writing, 1908 hits are retained with this query, which is still more than the approximately 800 genomes mentioned in the publication, but we got a lot closer.</p>

      <blockquote class="comment">
        <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment</div>

        <p>The vast majority of what has been excluded by adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RNA-Seq[Strategy]</code> to the query are datasets for which the “Strategy” is <em>AMPLICON</em>.
For these datasets, the viral RNA (or more precisely, the cDNA obtained from it) got amplified with a tiled-amplicon protocol.
While tiled-amplicon sequencing has emerged as a standard way of sequencing SARS-CoV-2 samples over the course of the pandemic, the corresponding protocols/primer schemes were simply not available during the early phase of the pandemic.</p>

      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>Instead of inspecting all 1908 hits one-by-one through the web interface, lets download the metadata for all samples in a single file
      <ol>
        <li>Click on the  <strong>Send to:</strong> dropdown at the top of the search results list</li>
        <li>Under <strong>Choose Destination</strong>, select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Run Selector</code></li>
        <li>Click <strong>Go</strong></li>
      </ol>

      <p><a href="../../images/get_runinfo.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/get_runinfo.png" alt="SRA search results with the &quot;Send to:&quot; dropdown configured for sending results to the Run Selector. " width="779" height="400" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

      <p>You will be taken to the SRA Run Selector page, where you can browse all of the metadata of all search hits rather conveniently.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>In the <strong>Select</strong> table, click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Metadata</code> in the <strong>Download</strong> column</p>

      <p><a href="../../images/metadata_from_run_selector.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/metadata_from_run_selector.png" alt="The SRA Run Selector page with the mouse hovering over the Metadata button. " width="864" height="604" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

      <p>This will download the metadata for all retrieved sequencing runs as a comma-separated text file.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

</blockquote>

<p>Now that we have downloaded this file we can go to a Galaxy instance and start processing it.</p>

<blockquote class="comment">
  <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-1"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment</div>

  <p>Note that the file we just downloaded is <strong>not</strong> sequencing data itself. Rather, it is <em>metadata</em> describing the data itself. We will use a few Galaxy tools to filter this list down to just a few accessions that will be used in the remainder of this tutorial.</p>

      <p>You will see that this file contains the same metadata that you could preview on the SRA Run Selector page.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

</blockquote>

<p>In Galaxy, it is rather easy to perform further filtering of the metadata records. For example, the publication mentions that the authors analyzed samples collected between 4 March and 9 May 2020.</p>

<p>If you inspect the metadata, you should see a column <strong>Collection_Date</strong>. That looks useful!</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <div class="box-title hands-on-title" id="hands-on-filter-metadata-lines-by-collection-date-range"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Hands-on: Filter metadata lines by collection date range</div>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><span class="tool" data-tool="Filter1" title="Filter data on any column using simple expressions tool" aria-role="button"><i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Filter data on any column using simple expressions</strong></span></p>

      <ul>
        <li><i class="far fa-file" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">param-file</span> <em>“Filter”</em>: the uploaded metadata</li>
        <li>
          <p><em>“With following condition”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"2020-03-04" &lt;= c11 &lt;= "2020-05-09"</code></p>

          <p>Column 11 (c11) is the Collection_Date column in this case.
If your input has this column in a different position, you would need to adjust the filter condition above accordingly.</p>
        </li>
        <li><em>“Number of header lines to skip”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

</blockquote>

<p>So now we are down to sequencing runs from the same date range as studied in the publication - though we still have more runs than samples discussed in the publication. Note, however, that the publication talks about assembled genomes, and it is possible that some of the sequencing runs listed in our metadata do not contain good enough data to assemble any SARS-CoV-2 genome information, or it could be that some viral samples got sequenced in several sequencing runs to obtain enough data.</p>

<p>We could explore this situation in more detail, and Galaxy could also process all the sequencing runs we are currently left with, but for the sake of simplicity of the tutorial, we want to select a <em>much</em> smaller subset of sequencing runs now anyway. In particular, from previous experience with this data we suggest to continue with just the following two interesting datasets: <strong>SRR11954102</strong> and <strong>SRR12733957</strong>. So let’s pull their identifiers out of the metadata file.</p>

<blockquote class="comment">
  <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-2"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment</div>
  <p>The following steps may seem a bit silly given that we just revealed the two identifiers above.
However, think of them as placeholders for extracting run identifiers based on some other criteria.</p>

<p>At this point, you should have a dataset with just two lines and a single column with this content:</p>

<h2 id="retrieve-selected-sequencing-data-from-the-sra">Retrieve selected sequencing data from the SRA</h2>

<p>Now that we have our identifiers of interest extracted, we are ready to download the actual sequencing data. Since this is a very common need Galaxy offers a dedicated tool for the purpose of downloading sequencing data from the SRA identified via its run accession.</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">

<p>Several entries should have been created in your history panel when you submitted the previous job:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pair-end data (fasterq-dump)</strong>: Contains Paired-end datasets (if available)</li>
  <li><strong>Single-end data (fasterq-dump)</strong> Contains Single-end datasets (if available)</li>
  <li><strong>Other data (fasterq-dump)</strong> Contains Unpaired datasets (if available)</li>
  <li><strong>fasterq-dump log</strong> Contains Information about the tool execution</li>
</ul>

<p>The first three items are actually <em>collections</em> of datasets.</p>

<p>When the tool run is finished (all history items created by it are green / done), take a moment to explore the collections by first <strong>clicking</strong> on the collection name in the history panel.  This takes you inside the collection and shows you the datasets in it.  You can then navigate back to the outer level of your history.</p>

<p>You should find that only the <strong>Pair-end data</strong> collection contains any sequencing data, which makes sense as both samples have been paired-end sequenced on the Illumina platform.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>You have seen now how to import public sequencing data into Galaxy, and you have performed the basic steps of variant calling on a batch of RNA-Seq SARS-CoV-2 data.</p>

<p>Galaxy allows you to do a lot more in terms of viral sequence data analysis though. Specifically, the advanced tutorial <a href="/training-material/topics/variant-analysis/tutorials/sars-cov-2-variant-discovery/tutorial.html">Mutation calling, viral genome reconstruction and lineage/clade assignment from SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data</a> is highly recommended if you want to learn how to perform a complete and more automated analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data that does not stop at lists of identified mutations but also produces consensus sequences and lineage assignments for all samples in a batch. This tutorial also shows how to deal with input data other than Illumina paired-end-sequenced RNA-Seq data.</p>
