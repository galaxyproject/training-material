# Introduction

Millions of people have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic after the first report of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China. During the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater surveillance has received extensive public attention as passive monitoring system that complements clinical and genomic surveillance:

1. The wastewater methods allow the **detection of outbreaks before the first positive clinical** tests are reported.

   Based on the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance, it has been found ({% cite zhang2021molecular %}) that virus RNA is detected in sewage even when COVID-19 prevalence is low, and that the correlation between concentration in sewage and reported COVID-19 prevalence indicates that sewage surveillance can be used as a sensitive tool to monitor viral circulation in the population.

2. Wastewater surveillance is **more economical** than clinical testing since it can screen large numbers of people with just a few samples and does not need clinician involvement.
3. Using the wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 method, data can be collected from people who do not have access to healthcare or in places, so-called "sequencing deserts", around the world where sequencing capacity is limited.

   Among such "sequencing deserts", new, potentially dangerous variants, like Omicron, are able to emerge and spread undetected. There is a risk that new variants or subvariants will emerge until representative samples are sufficiently sequenced. Wastewater surveillance is one of the opportunities for covering "sequencing deserts" for surveillance of variants of SARS-CoV-2. As a result, a very close to a real-time overview of disease prevalence could be provided since it was proved ({% cite zhang2021molecular %}) successful enough in revealing infection dynamics earlier than clinical testing.

The wastewater surveillance methods are a good solution for enabling early, economical, and efficient detection so that public-health measures can be implemented as soon as they are necessary.

![Upper branch shows a clinical surveillance of sars-cov-2, from the infection moment to bioinformatics data analysis; lower branch, in turn, represents wastewater surveillance.](./images/ww-process-ww.png "Schematic diagram shows the process of detecting viruses by wastewater surveillance against clinical surveillance.")

Various wastewater tracking projects have been then implemented in countries like [Estonia](https://www.terviseamet.ee/et/reoveeseire-kaardirakendus), [Greece](http://trams.chem.uoa.gr/covid-19/), and [Canada](https://cwn-rce.ca/covid-19-wastewater-coalition/covid-19-wastewater-coalition-maps/). [COVIDPoops19](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/c778145ea5bb4daeb58d31afee389082), a dashboard developed by Colleen Naughton and colleagues at the University of California (UC), Merced, shows monitoring projects for SARS-CoV-2 have sprung up in at least 70 countries since then ({% cite naughton2021show %}). By October 2021, the European Union recommended that all member countries establish monitoring systems for SARS-CoV-2. 26 of 27 countries have adopted this recommendation. In the United States, the National Wastewater Surveillance System includes 400 sites in 19 states. In the U.S., on 2 March 2022, President Joe Biden's administration said the monitoring system would be part of efforts to detect new variants as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added a national dashboard of wastewater data.

## Methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples

The tracking projects have been possible thanks to several methods and protocols, developed to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples.

**Two sequencing platforms (Illumina and Oxford Nanopore)** in combination with **2 established library preparation (ampliconic and metatranscriptomic)** strategies are predominantly used to generate SARS-CoV-2 sequence data:

![Heatmap showing in columns the library strategies (ampliconic, RNA-seq, targeted-capture, WGS) and in rows the sequencing platforms (BGISEQ, DNBSEQ, Illumina, Ion Torrent, Oxford Nanopore. The vast majority of those datasets, by 1-2 orders of magnitude, are Illumina Ampliconic and WGS datasets.)](./images/ena_datasets.png "Number of samples available for each sequencing platform and library preparation strategy for SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater according to ENA archive as of May 2022.")

## Bioinformatics pipelines for SARS-CoV-2 wastewater data

However, data alone do not equal knowledge: they need to be analyzed, using bioinformatics pipelines. Tools can differ from one pipeline to another. But the main steps, in general, are more or less the same:

1. **Pre-processing**, including
   1. **Quality control** of the sequencing data
   2. **Triming**: primer with ARTIC protocol, adapter with Illumina
   3. **Decontamination** to remove reads from the human genome
2. **Mapping** to SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence and **mapping processing** to clean mapping data
3. **Variant calling** SARS-CoV-2 variants
4. SARS-CoV-2 **lineage abundance computation**

![Here is simplified process of bioinformatics steps used to analyze sequenced data for sars-cov-2 surveillance. Tools can differ from one pipeline to another. But the main steps, in general, are more or less the same. Raw data are sequencing data. Then, primer trimming is a specific step for ampliconic datasets. The auxiliary file is used for this step - a BED file specifying the primers used during amplification. Variant calling should be run where variants from sequence data are identified. Variant calling step is followed by mutation annotation. The data is not changed; here, only format is changed to be more readable](./images/sars-surveillance-bioinf-last.png "Main steps to be done for bioinformatics of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance.")

Approaches specifically developed for wastewater are either individual tools that require data preprocessing and/or need to be plugged into pipelines before they can be used, or independent pipelines that do all the analysis from raw data to determining lineages and their abundances.

## Galaxy effort to surveillance data processing

In order to address global health emergencies in an accessible and transparent manner, there is a need for scientific computing infrastructure to help bridge these gaps. **Accessibility and transparency** in data analysis transparency are the primary focus of the Galaxy community.

Since the beginning of the pandemy, the Galaxy community put effort to offer a [complete solution to the SARS-CoV-2 data analytics challenge](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/covid19/) ({% cite maier2021ready %}). In particular, four workflows were developed aimed at detecting and interpreting sequence
variants in SARS-CoV-2 in clinical data:

![Left: Flowchart from top to bottom. On the top in the fastq large grey box, 3 green boxes: ONT ARTIC data, Illumina ARTIC data, Illumina RNA-Seq data. Each connected to 1 or 2 green boxes in the VCF/TSV grey box below: ONT ARTIC data --> ONT ARTIC workflow, Illumina ARTIC data --> Illumina ARTIC PE workflow, Illumina RNA-Seq data --> Illumina RNA-Seq SE workflow and  Illumina RNA-Seq PE workflow.

## Galaxy workflows for wastewater surveillance

These pipelines perform decent data preprocessing steps and have shown promising results on clinical data, making them worthy of being repurposed for
wastewater data. In addition, it is easier to adapt existing Galaxy workflows than integrating new standalone pipelines.

We then adapted the Galaxy workflows by combining them with wastewater tools. We selected **Freyja** ({% cite karthikeyan2022wastewater %}) and **COJAC** ({% cite jahn2022early %}) tools because:
1. Their use in various projects (such as wastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition in US, wastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants in Switzerland and in England) has shown decent results
2. Their ability to be integrated into existing Galaxy pipelines
3. They target different user groups (e.g., politicians and researchers), which is interesting to cover

   Freyja's output is easy to interpret without some specific knowledge, while COJAC requires more knowledge to be used. First of all, it demands some knowledge in programming as the output of COJAC is quite raw so far and has to be processed for downstream analysis like plotting and integrating to remote platforms such as CoV-Spectrum. Second of all, the usage of COJAC requires some knowledge of virology. Despite this, COJAC provides more detailed information and is able to detect unknown variants.

**2 workflows** were then created for different types of input data:

- Paired-end data derived from **Illumina-based Metatranscriptomic** experiments
- Paired-end data generated with **Illumina-based Ampliconic (ARTIC)** protocols

Therefore we offer a tutorial with different versions
- for each workflow
- for each workflow, a short version consisting in running workflows and a long version (step-by-step)

# Prepare Galaxy and data

Any analysis should get its own Galaxy history. So let's start by creating a new one:

> <hands-on-title>Prepare the Galaxy history</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Create a new history for this analysis
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/histories_create_new.md %}
>
> 2. Rename the history
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/histories_rename.md %}
>
{: .hands_on}

Before we can begin any Galaxy analysis, we need to upload the input data: FASTQ files with the sequenced wastewater samples. We encourage you to use your own data here (with at least 2 samples).

<div class="Amplicon-Short Amplicon-Long" markdown="1">
If you do not have any datasets available, we provide an example dataset: [paired-end data generated synthetically with Illumina-based Ampliconic (ARTIC) protocols](https://github.com/suskraem/ww_benchmark).
</div>

<div class="Metatranscriptomic-Short Metatranscriptomic-Long" markdown="1">
If you do not have any datasets available, we provide an example dataset: paired-end Illumina-based metatranscriptomic extracted from 24-hour composite samples of municipal wastewater from around the San Francisco Bay Area, California, and enriched for respiratory viruses using the Illumina Respiratory Virus Panel ([PRJNA661613 on ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA661613)).
</div>

There are several possibilities to upload the data depending on how many datasets you have and what their origin is:

- Import datasets

  - from your local file system,
  - from a given URL or
  - from a shared data library on the Galaxy server you are working on

  and organize the imported data as a dataset collection.

Besides the sequenced reads data, we need additional datasets for calling variants and annotating them:

- the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence [NC_045512.2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512.2?report=fasta) to align and compare our sequencing data against

- a tabular dataset defining aliases for viral gene product names, which will let us translate NCBI RefSeq Protein identifiers (used by the SnpEff annotation tool) to the commonly used names of coronavirus proteins and cleavage products.

<div class="Amplicon-Short Amplicon-Long" markdown="1">

Another three datasets are needed only for the analysis of ampliconic, e.g. ARTIC-amplified, input data:

- a BED file specifying the primers used during amplification and their binding sites on the viral genome
- a custom tabular file describing the amplicon grouping of the primers
- BED file defining the amplicons that is used by **Cojac**

# From FASTQ to SARS-CoV-2 lineages abundances

To identify the lineages and their aboundances, several steps have to be done to process data.

![Here is simplified process of bioinformatics steps used to analyze sequenced data for sars-cov-2 surveillance. Tools can differ from one pipeline to another. But the main steps, in general, are more or less the same. Raw data are sequencing data. Then, primer trimming is a specific step for ampliconic datasets. The auxiliary file is used for this step - a BED file specifying the primers used during amplification. Variant calling should be run where variants from sequence data are identified. Variant calling step is followed by mutation annotation. The data is not changed; here, only format is changed to be more readable](./images/sars-surveillance-bioinf-last.png "Main steps to be done for bioinformatics of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance.")

Let's run them

# Preprocessing

To prepare the data, we first need to do:

1. **Quality control** of the sequencing data

   There is no perfect sequencing technology, and each instrument will generate different types and amounts of errors, such as incorrect nucleotide calls. Each sequencing platform has technical limitations that result in these incorrectly called bases. Thus, it is important to identify and exclude error types that may affect downstream analysis interpretation. As a result, **sequence quality control is an essential first step** in the analysis process.

   > <comment-title></comment-title>
   > For more information about quality control, please see our dedicated ["Quality control"]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.md %}) Tutorial.
   {: .comment}

   Here we use **fastp** ({% cite chen2018fastp %}) which:

   1. Filter out bad reads (too low quality, too short, or too many N...)
   2. Cut low quality bases for per read in its 5' and 3' by evaluating the mean quality from a sliding window (like Trimmomatic but faster)
   3. Trim all reads in front and tail
   4. Cut adapters

      Adapter sequences can be automatically detected, which means you don't have to input the adapter sequences to trim them.

      With Illumina sequencing, we often get raw reads with adapters at 3' end. The adapters contain the sequencing primer binding sites, the index sequences, and the sites that allow library fragments to attach to the flow cell lawn. This might influence a downstream analysis, thus, adapter trimming is required.

   5. Correct mismatched base pairs in overlapped regions of paired end reads, if one base is with high quality while the other is with ultra-low quality

   **fastp** is run on each sample individually and the report are then aggregated using **MultiQC** ({% cite ewels2016multiqc %})

   Another step, primer trimming, is a specific step for datasets generated with ARTIC protocol. The auxiliary file is used for this step - a BED file specifying the primers used during amplification and their binding sites on the viral genome. Primer trimmer uses primer positions supplied in a BED file to soft clip primer sequences from an aligned and sorted BAM file. More specifically, some primer trimmers, in order to do quality trimming, use a sliding window approach. The window slides from the 5' end to the 3' end and if at any point the average base quality in the window falls below the threshold, the remaining read is softly clipped. If after trimming, the length of the read is greater than the minimum length specified, the read is written to the new trimmed BAM file. It should be noted, for datasets that were not generated with primer-based protocol like ARTIC, this primer-trimming step is not applicable.

2. **Decontamination** to remove reads from the human genome

# Diversity evaluation

In wastewater, we can find not only SARS-CoV-2 sequences but also sequences of the DNA of other organisms. We can evaluate the diversity of organism sequence using tools classifying reads to taxons by comparing them to reference databases.

{% snippet topics/metagenomics/faqs/taxon.md %}

To assign reads to taxons, we use **Kraken2** {% cite Wood2014 %} with a database of viruses. If we would be more interested in bacteria or eukaryotes, we could use a different database.

# Mapping

To identify SARS-CoV-2 variants in the sample, we first map the reads to the reference SARS-CoV-2 sequence, named `NC_045512.2`and publicly available in NCBI database.

> <comment-title></comment-title>
> For more information about mapping, please see our dedicated ["Mapping"]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/mapping/tutorial.md %}) Tutorial.
{: .comment}

The mapping tool can differ from one pipeline to another, depending on read length, sequencing technology, and other factors. Here we use **bwa-mem** ({% cite li2009fast %})

### Mapping statistics

The output of **bwa-mem** is a BAM file: a compressed binary file storing the read sequences, whether they have been aligned to a reference sequence (e.g. a chromosome), and if so, the position on the reference sequence at which they have been aligned.

It can not be easily parsed. We can use a tool from **Samtools** suite to collects statistics from BAM files and then display them with **MulitQC**.

## Mapping processing

Some mapping tools generate 2 BAM files: one with mapped reads and one with either all reads or just the unmapped ones. Here **bwa-mem** generates only one BAM file with all reads. So to get information about only the mapped reads with a good mapping quality, we need to filter the BAM file using **Samtools**.

Mapping results need afterward to be **processed**, steps that are not always included in pipelines

- **Removing duplicated reads**

   This step can be important for Illumina sequencing reads. During the sequencing process with Illumina sequencing technology, some duplicate reads/sequences can be produced, which can create bias in downstream analyses. It is, therefore, possible to remove duplicates or mark them without removing them. When removing duplicates, one should be certain that they are duplicates and not repeated regions. It can therefore be reasonable to keep duplicates marked rather than remove them, as this can be useful for downstream analysis.

- **Read realignment**

   To correct mapping errors, it is good after filtering and other steps to realign the reads using probabilistic approaches, e.g. the **Realign reads** from LoFreq ({% cite wilm2012lofreq %}).

- **Indel quality insertion**

   Indels, i.e. short insertions or deletions, are not parsed when they overlap the beginning or end of alignment boundaries. Thezy can cuause potential ambiguity. Input insertions and deletions must be homogenized with left realignment in order to gain a more homogeneous distribution. Left realignment will place all indels in homopolymer and microsatellite repeats at the same position, provided that doing so does not introduce mismatches between the read and reference other than the indel ({% cite garrison2012haplotype %}). Basically, this step, which is not present everywhere, is considered to correct mapping errors and prepare reads for further variant calling.

   Here we use a tool from LoFreq suite and Dindel ({% cite albers2011dindel %}) to insert indel qualities

# Variant calling

Now that mapping results have been clean, we want to identify the SARS-CoV-2 allelic variants (AVs), i.e. identify of positions where the sequenced sample is different from the reference sequence. We call sensitive AV across a wide range of allele frequences (AFs) using **Lofreq** ({% cite wilm2012lofreq %}).

**Lofreq** generates VCF files, i.e. tabular files containing:
1. meta-information lines,
2. a header line,
3. data lines each containing information about a position in the genome:
   1. `CHROM` - chromosome: An identifier from the reference genome or an angle-bracketed ID String  pointing to a contig in the assembly file
   2. `POS` - position: The reference position, with the 1st base having position 1
   3. `ID` - identifier: Semicolon-separated list of unique identifiers where available
   4. `REF` - reference base(s): Each base must be one of A,C,G,T,N (case insensitive)
   5. `ALT` - alternate base(s): Comma separated list of alternate non-reference alleles
   6. `QUAL` - quality: Phred-scaled quality score for the assertion made in ALT.
   7. `FILTER` - filter status:
      - PASS if this position has passed all filters
      - A semicolon-separated list of codes for filters that fail
   8. `INFO` - additional information

The output of **Freyja demix** is a table with aggregated information about lineages abundances for all samples. Each line in the table represents one sample:

1. `Sample`: sample name
1. `summarized`: sum of all lineage abundances in a particular WHO designation (i.e. B.1.617.2 and AY.6 abundances are summed in the above example), otherwise they are grouped into "Other".
2. `lineages`: lists of the identified lineages in descending order
3. `abundances`: corresponding abundances estimates
4. `resid`: the residual of the weighted least absolute devation problem used to estimate lineage abundances
5. `coverage`: 10x coverage estimate (percent of sites with 10 or greater reads- 10 is the default but can be modfied in the options)

**COJAC** can also be used on variants from amplicon data:
1. Scanning the alignment files for mutation co-occurrences using **mutbamscan**
2. Combining files from all samples in one table
3. Export coocurrence mutations as a table using **tabmut**

**COJAC** produces a table (**Mutation cooccurrence**) providing an aggregated information about lineages abundances and mutations for all samples grouped by amplicons. Each line in the table represents one sample.

1. `Sample`: sample name
2. `count`: total count of amplicons carrying the sites of interest
3. `mut_all`: amplicons carrying mutations on all site of interest (e.g.: variant mutations observed on all sites)
4. `mut_oneless`: amplicons where one mutation is missing (e.g.: only 2 out of 3 sites carried the variant mutation, 1 sites carries wild-type)
5. `frac`: fraction (mut_all/count) or empty if no counts
6. `cooc`: number of considered site (e.g.: 2 sites of interests) or empty if no counts

# Conclusion


In this tutorial, we used Galaxy workflows for the detection and interpretation of lineages abundances in SARS-CoV-2 wastewater samples.

The workflows can be freely used and immediately accessed from the three global Galaxy instances. Each is capable of supporting thousands of users running hundreds of thousands of analyses per month.

It is also possible to automate the workflow runs using the command line as explained in [a dedicated tutorial]({% link topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/workflow-automation/tutorial.md %}).
