As this tutorial uses real world data some of the tools can run for quite a while. During a course we can expected longer run times as the Galaxy servers are heavily used. Typically expected runtimes are approximately:


| Tool name | Runtime |
|-----------|---------|
| FastQC    | 2 minutes |
| MultiQC   | 5 minutes |
| Trimmomatic | 5 minutes |
| kraken2   | 5 - 12 minutes |
| snippy    | 15 - 25 minutes |
| TB Variant Filter | 2 minutes |
| TB-Profiler | 5 minutes |
| Text transformation | Less than 1 minute |
| TB Variant Report | 1 minute |
| JBrowse | 5 minutes |
| Samtools stats (optional) | 1 minute |
| BAM Coverage plotter (optional) | 1 minute |
