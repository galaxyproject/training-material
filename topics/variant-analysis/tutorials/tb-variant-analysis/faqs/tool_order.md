The tools are presented in the order that a typical analysis would use. If you want to run some tools in parallel (to save time) you can do so. [This workflow](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/pvanheus/w/m-tuberculosis-variant-analysis-tutorial-imported-from-uploaded-file) illustrates the analysis done in the tutorial and shows that there are multiple “paths” leading to outputs that have some steps that could be run at the same time: MultiQC, Kraken2, JBrowse and TB Variant Report.
