  "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. According to the [WHO](https://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/en/), in 2018 there were 10.0 million new cases of TB worldwide and 1.4 million deaths due to the disease, making TB the world's most deadly infectious disease. The [publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9634230) of the genome of *M. tuberculosis H37Rv* in 1998 gave researchers a powerful new tool in understanding this pathogen. This genome has been revised since then, with the latest version being available"

                <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/en/">WHO</a>, in 2018 there were 10.0 million new cases of TB worldwide and 1.4 million deaths due to the disease, making TB the world’s most deadly infectious disease. The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9634230">publication</a> of the genome of <em>M. tuberculosis H37Rv</em> in 1998 gave researchers a powerful new tool in understanding this pathogen. This genome has been revised since then, with the latest version being available
as RefSeq entry <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_000962.3/">NC_000962.3</a>. The genome comprises a single circular chromosome of some 4.4 megabases. The H37Rv strain that the genome was sequenced from is a long-preserved laboratory strain, originally <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2132400">isolated</a> from a patient in 1905 and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3181/00379727-33-8330P">named</a> as H37Rv in 1935. It is notably different in some genomic <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888754317300617?via%3Dihub">regions</a> from some modern clinical strains but remains the standard reference sequence for <em>M. tuberculosis</em> (Mtb). In a larger context <em>M. tuberculosis</em> is a prominent member of the Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Complex (MTBC).</p>

<p>This group of related species comprises of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16626-6">8</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29456241">lineages</a> of human-infecting <em>M. tuberculosis</em> as well as predominantly animal-infecting species such as <em>M. bovis</em> and <em>M. pinnipedii</em>. Two other close relatives of Mtb, <em>M. leprae</em> and <em>M. lepromatosis</em> circulate between humans, causing the disease leprosy. Finally amongst the Mycobacteria there are several other species that live in the environment and can cause human disease. These are the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28345639">Nontuberculous Mycobacteria</a>.</p>

<p>Variation in the genome of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> (Mtb) is associated with changes in phenotype, for example <a href="https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-019-0660-8">drug resistance</a> and virulence. It is also useful for <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00087/full">outbreak investigation</a> as the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a sample can be used to build a phylogeny.</p>

<p>This tutorial will focus on identifying genomic variation in Mtb and using that to explore drug resistance and other aspects of the bacteria.</p>

<h1 id="get-your-data">Get your data</h1>

<p>The data for today is a sample of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJEB18529">collected</a> from a <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-017-0834-4">southern African patient</a>. In addition to the bacterial sequence sample we will work with a Genbank format version of the genome of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.590">inferred</a> most recent common <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3497110">ancestor</a> of the M. tuberculosis complex which is combined with the annotation of the H37Rv reference sequence. This ancestral genome only differs from the H37Rv version 3 genome (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_000962.3">NC_000962.3</a>) by the insertion of SNPs to try and model the ancestor of all lineages of Mtb.</p>

<h1 id="quality-control">Quality control</h1>

<p>This step serves the purpose of identifying possible issues with the raw
sequenced reads input data before embarking on any “real” analysis steps.</p>

<p>Some of the typical problems with NGS data can be mitigated by preprocessing
affected sequencing reads before trying to map them to the reference genome.
Detecting some other, more severe problems early on may at least save you a lot
of time spent on analyzing low-quality data that is not worth the effort.</p>

<p>Here, we will perform a standard quality check on our input data and only point
out a few interesting aspects about that data. For a more thorough explanation
of NGS data quality control, you may want to have a look at the dedicated
tutorial on <a href="/training-material/topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.html">“Quality control”</a>.</p>

            <li>Sequence quality is quite good overall. If anything you might
consider trimming the 3’ ends of reads (base qualities decline
slightly towards the 3’ ends) or to filter out the small fraction

          <ol>
            <li>There are 4 output files: Forwards paired and single reads and reverse paired and single reads. The single reads come about when one read in a pair of reads has failed the quality checks and so is deleted. The other half of the pair may still be good and so it is put into the single reads file for the appropriate direction. While un-paired reads might sometimes be useful, paired reads are more useful because both their sequence and the gap between them (the “insert size”) can be used for further analysis. In a typical analysis, only the paired reads are used.</li>

<p><em>Note:</em> We would normally examine our trimmed reads with <strong>FastQC</strong> and <strong>MultiQC</strong> again to see if the quality trimming has been successful, but in this tutorial we will move straight on to save time.</p>

<h1 id="look-for-contamination-with-kraken2-optional">Look for contamination with Kraken2 (optional)</h1>

<p>We should also look for contamination in our reads. Sometimes, other sources of DNA accidentally or inadvertantly get mixed in with our sample. Any reads from non-sample sources will confound our SNP analysis. <strong>Kraken2</strong> is an effective way of looking at which species is represented in our reads and so we can easily spot possible contamination of our sample. Unfortunately the tool uses a lot of RAM (typically 50GB when used with the <em>Standard</em> database), so you might want to skip this step if your environment doesn’t have enough computing nodes able to process such jobs. For an example of a probably-contaminated sample that does not use <strong>Kraken2</strong> as part of its analysis, see the optional section on analysing <em>SRR12416842</em> at the end of this tutorial.</p>

<h1 id="find-variants-with-snippy">Find variants with Snippy</h1>

<p>We will now run the Snippy tool on our reads, comparing them to the reference.</p>

<p>Snippy is a tool for rapid bacterial SNP calling and core genome alignments. Snippy finds SNPs between a haploid reference genome and your NGS sequence reads. It will find both substitutions (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels).</p>

<p>If we give Snippy an annotated reference in Genbank format, it will run a tool called SnpEff which will figure out the effect of any changes on the genes and other features. If we just give Snippy the reference sequence alone without the annotations, it will not run SnpEff.</p>

<p>We have an annotated reference built from the inferred <em>M. tuberculosis</em> <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3497110">ancestral reference genome</a> and the
gene annotation from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_000962.3">H37Rv strain</a> so will use it in this case.</p>

<p><strong>RECAP</strong>: So far we have taken our sample reads, cleaned them up a bit, checked for taxonomic assocation, compared the reads with our reference sequence and then called variants (SNPs and indels) between our sample and the reference genome. We have tried to mitigate a few errors along the way:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sequencing errors: these were addressed by the quality trimming step</li>
  <li>Sample contamination: we used <strong>Kraken2</strong> to assess the extent of this problem in our sample</li>
  <li>Appropriate choice of a reference genome: we used a genome that is inferred to be ancestral to all <em>M. tuberculosis</em> for our analysis and the diversity within Mtb is limited enough for us to rely on a single reference genome for the entire species.</li>
  <li>Quality filtering in the mapping and variant calling stage: Internally <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">snippy</code> uses tools like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bwa-mem</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">freebayes</code> that judge the quality of their predictions. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">snippy</code> then uses this information to perform some filtering on variant calling predictions.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="further-variant-filtering-and-tb-profiling">Further variant filtering and TB-profiling</h1>

<p>We still cannot entirely trust the proposed variants. In particular, there are regions of the <em>M. tuberculosis</em> genome that are difficult to effectively map reads to. These include the PE/PPE/PGRS genes, which are highly repetitive, and the IS (insertion sequence sites). Secondly, when an insertion or deletion (indel) occurs in our sample relative to the reference it can cause apparent, but false, single nucleotide variants to appear near the indel. Finally where few reads map to a region of the reference genome, either because of a sequence deletion or because of a high GC content in the genomic region, we cannot be confident about the quality of variant calling in the region. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TB Variant Filter</code> can help filter out variants based on a variety of criteria, including those listed above.</p>

  <p>TB Variant Filter tries to provide reasonable defaults for filtering
variants predicted in the M. tuberculosis
genome, using multiple different strategies.
Firstly, certain regions of the Mtb genome
contain repetitive sequences, e.g. from
the PE/PPE gene family. Historically all of the genomic regions corresponding to
those genes were filtered out but 
the new default draws on work from
Maximillian Marin and others. This
list of “refined low confidence” (RLC)
regions is the current region filter in
TB Variant Filter for reads over 100 bp.
If you are using shorter reads (e.g. from Illumina iSeq) the “Refined Low Confidence and Low Mappability” region list should be used instead.
For more on how these regions were calculated read the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/38/7/1781/6502279?login=false">paper</a> or <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.08.438862v3.full">preprint</a>.</p>

  <p>In addition to region filters, filters for variant type, allele frequency, coverage depth and distance from indels are provided.
Older variant callers struggled to accurately
call insertions and deletions (indels) but more recent tools (e.g. GATK v4 and the variant caller used in Snippy, Freebayes) no longer have this weakness. One remaining reason to filter SNVs/SNPs near indels is that they might have a different
evolutionary history to “free standing” SNVs/SNPs, so the “close to indel filter” is still available in TB Variant Filter in case such SNPs/SNVs should be filtered out.</p>

<p>Now that we have a collection of <em>high quality variants</em> we can search them against variants known to be associated with drug resistance. The <em>TB Profiler</em> tool does this using a database of variants curated by Dr Jody Phelan at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It can do its own mapping and variant calling but also accepts mapped reads in BAM format as input. It does its own variant calling and filtering.</p>

<p>Finally, TB Variant Report use the COMBAT-TB <a href="https://explorer.sanbi.ac.za">eXplorer</a> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz658/5554700">database</a> of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> genome annotation to annotate variants in Mtb. It also takes the output of <em>TB Profiler</em> and produces a neat report that is easy to browse and search.</p>

<p>A new dataset will be created in your history, containing the JBrowse interactive visualisation. We will now view its contents and play with it by clicking the <i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">galaxy-eye</span> (eye) icon of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JBrowse on data XX and data XX - Complete</code> dataset. The JBrowse window will appear in the centre Galaxy panel.</p>

<p>You can now click on the names of the tracks to add them in, try the vcf file and gff file. You can see where the variants are located and which genes they are in. If you click on the BAM file you can zoom right in to see the read alignments for each variant if you wish.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3960260">Zenodo</a> we have included sample <em>18-1</em> from the same study (aka. <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERR1750907">ERR1750907</a>). This is also a southern African
<em>M. tuberculosis</em> sample, but in some ways quite different from the sample we have analysed in the tutorial thus
far.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>The quality of the sequence drops sharply towards the end of the sequences. Even more concerning, the sequence content changes across the length of the sample, which is not what we would expect at all. Finally, the sample seems to contain sequencing adapters, an artefact of the sequencing process that should be trimmed out before any sequence analysis.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Less than 60% of the sequence reads are associated with the genus <em>Mycobacterium</em>. Perhaps the quality problems in the sequence reads contribute to this poor classification? They certainly will make variant calling less reliable. You might get too many (false positive) or too few (false negative) variants reported compared to what is actually present in the sample.</p>

<p>As you can see, quality of sequence data strongly determines how useful it is for subsequent analysis. This is why quality control is always a first step before trying to call and interpret variants. What we do with a sample like this will depend on what resources we have available. Can we discard it and use other data for our analysis? Can we re-sequence? Can we clean it up, remove the adapters (using <strong>Trimmomatic</strong>, <strong>fastp</strong> or <strong>cutadapt</strong>) and perhaps use the <strong>Kraken2</strong> output to decide which reads to keep? These are all possible strategies and there is no one answer for which is the correct one to pursue.</p>

<p>There is something clearly wrong with sample SRR12416842, perhaps indicating sample contamination. This example of a sample that doesn’t map to the reference genome illustrates that even when sequence quality is good, sequence data problems can become apparent in later steps of analysis and it is important to always have a sense of what results to expect. You can develop a better sense of what quality control results to expect by first practicing techniques with known data before analysing new samples.</p>
