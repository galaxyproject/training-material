## Lineage designation
Phylogenetic lineage assignment is important in tracing both existing and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Mutations occur in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 virus to produce a fingerprint that can be used for to infer ancestral relationships. The specific collection of mutations in the viral genome leads to a particular lineage/clade of SARS-CoV-2 variant. Here variant means genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 strain from the reference genome.

### Phylogenetic lineage assignment with `Pangolin`.
> Find the `Pangolin` tool from the tool bar.
> 1. Leave the **Download the latest Pangolin from web** option as default for the pangoLEARN source section
> 2. Rerun the Pangolin with UShER model selected as **Yes**. UShER model is a new model for lineage identification

### Phylogenetic lineage designation with `Nextclade`
> Find the `Nextclade` tool from the tool bar.
