This is a tutorial on analysis of SARS-CoV-2 data generated using the [ARTIC](https://artic.network/) amplicon protocol on Illumina sequencers. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 has a linear RNA genome of about 30,000 bases with 11 coding regions which code for 12 potential proteins. Some of these proteins are spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and envelope (E). You can see a visualisation of the genome at [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/sviewer/?id=NC_045512&tracks=[key:sequence_track,name:Sequence,display_name:Sequence,id:STD649220238,annots:Sequence,ShowLabel:false,ColorGaps:false,shown:true,order:1][key:gene_model_track,name:Genes,display_name:Genes,id:STD3194982005,annots:Unnamed,Options:ShowAllButGenes,CDSProductFeats:true,NtRuler:true,AaRuler:true,HighlightMode:2,ShowLabel:true,shown:true,order:9]&v=1:29903&c=null&select=null&slim=0) and watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYgVmOLF2mY) to learn more about the virus and its proteins. 

Sequencing of viral samples can used to identify genetic mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. These mutations can be used to trace the emergence of new strains and to assign virus samples to known lineages and clades and contribute to genomic epidemiology. What is genomic epidemiology? Here are some definitions:

* **Epidemiology**: the study of the patterns, the spread and the causes of diseases and disorders within a given population and the application of this knowledge to prevent and control health problems

* **Genomic epidemiology**: Is the  use of pathogen genomic data to determine the distribution and spread of an infectious diseases in a specified population and application of this information in the control of health problems. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the virus genome can be sequenced and this data can be used to monitor the emergence of important new variants, and to monitor the trends after an intervention. The [US CDC Genomic Epidemiology Toolkit](https://www.cdc.gov/amd/training/covid-19-gen-epi-toolkit.html) is a good introduction to genomic epdemiology of SARS-CoV-2.

This tutorial is meant to assist you in analyzing  SARS-CoV-2  short read sequence data with the aim of identifying the SARS-CoV-2 variants, assign lineages and help monitor the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. This is important in public health management of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This tutorial assumes some familiarity with the Galaxy interface. If you are new to Galaxy, we recommend that you do one of the tutorials from the [Introduction to Galaxy Analyses]({{ site.baseurl }}/topics/introduction/) section.
