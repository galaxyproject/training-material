                <p>Human Copy Number Variations (hCNVs) are the result of structural genomic rearrangements that result in the duplication or deletion of DNA segments. These changes contribute significantly to human genetic variability, diseases, and somatic genome variations in cancer and other diseases <span class="citation"><a href="#Nam2015">Nam <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>. hCNVs can be routinely investigated by genomic hybridisation and sequencing technologies
. There is a range of software tools that can be used to identify and quantify hCNVs. Unfortunately, locating hCNVs is still a challenge in standardising formats for data representation and exchange. Furthermore, the sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and reusability of hCNV detection and analysis research software varies. As a result, there is a need for the adoption of community-developed standards for data discovery and exchange. To address that ELIXIR developed <span class="citation"><a href="#Beacon">Beacon</a></span> protocol and <span class="citation"><a href="#GA4GH">for Genomics and Health</a></span> standards, as well as mechanisms for annotating, benchmarking, creating reproducible and sharable tools and workflows, such as <span class="citation"><a href="#WorkflowHub">WorkflowHub</a></span>, Galaxy, and <span class="citation"><a href="#OpenEBench">ELIXIR</a></span>, and, most importantly, accessible training resources and infrastructure.</p>

<p>This tutorial is a modification of a Galaxy Training Network tutorial <a href="/training-material/topics/variant-analysis/tutorials/somatic-variants/tutorial.html">Somatic variant calling</a> tutorial to provide training on how to preprocess, identify and visualise hCNV regions using Control-FreeC tool using tumor/normal samples pairs.</p>

<h1 id="data-preparation">Data Preparation</h1>
<p>First, start with uploading and preparing the input data to analyze. The sequencing reads used in this analysis are from real-world data from a cancer patient’s tumor and normal tissue samples. For the sake of an acceptable speed of the analysis, the original data has been downsampled though to include only the reads from human chromosomes 5, 12 and 17.</p>

      <p>This tutorial has a set of shared steps performed on the data. To track the
data in the history, it is recommended to tag the datasets by attaching a meaningful tag ‘#’
to them. The tagging will automatically be attached to any file generated
from the original tagged dataset.
  <em>e.g.</em>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#normal</code> for normal tissue datasets (with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-N_</code> in the name) and
  <em>e.g.</em>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#tumor</code> for tumor dataset (with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-T_</code> in the name).</p>

This simplifies the tracking of datasets across the Galaxy interface.

The unique feature of these tags is that they <em>propagate</em>: if a dataset is labelled with a name tag, all derivatives (children) of this dataset will automatically inherit this tag (see below). The figure below explains why this is so useful. Consider the following analysis (numbers in parenthesis correspond to dataset numbers in the figure below):</p>   <ol>   <li>a set of forward and reverse reads (datasets 1 and 2) is mapped against a reference using <span><strong>Bowtie2</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> generating dataset 3;</li>   <li>dataset 3 is used to calculate read coverage using <span><strong>BedTools Genome Coverage</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> <em>separately</em> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> strands.

This is shown on the left side of the figure. It is hard to trace which datasets contain “plus” data versus “minus” data. For example, does dataset 10 contain “plus” data or “minus” data? Probably “minus” but are you sure? In the case of a small history like the one shown here, it is possible to trace this manually but as the size of a history grows it will become very challenging.</p>   <p>The right side of the figure shows exactly the same analysis, but using name tags. When the analysis was conducted datasets 4 and 5 were tagged with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#plus</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#minus</code>, respectively. When they were used as inputs to Macs2 resulting datasets 6 and 8 automatically inherited them and so on… As a result it is straightforward to trace both branches (plus and minus) of this analysis.</p>   <p>More information is in a <a href="/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/name-tags/tutorial.html">dedicated #nametag tutorial</a>.</p>   <!-- Image is here = https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1iiNsau6ddiE2MV9qMyekUq2mrpDHHcc02bXtcFEAnhY/edit?usp=sharing --> </blockquote>

<h1 id="quality-control-and-mapping-of-ngs-reads">Quality control and mapping of NGS reads</h1>
<p>The data was obtained following a series of laboratory procedures, including DNA preparation, extraction, and sequencing, which means there is a possibility of errors occurring during those steps, which could affect data quality. To address that, it is necessary to test the quality of the fastq reads. The data quality needs to be within an acceptable range before looking for hCNVs. The low-quality data can lead us to false results. To detect low-quality data,  preprocessing step is required to trim or discard the low-quality reads before proceeding with the mapping and hCNV detection steps.</p>

              <p>TThe GC content plots for the samples’ forward and reverse reads 
show an unusual bimodal distribution.</p>

              <p>The unnormal distribution of the GC content of reads from a sample is 
usually interpreted as a sign of possible contamination.
However, we are dealing with sequencing data from captured exomes,
which means that the reads do not represent random sequences from a  genome.
They rather represent an arbitrary selection. Indeed, the samples were 
prepared using Agilent’s SureSelect V5 technology for exome enrichment, 
and bimodal GC content distributions have been identified as a hallmark 
of that capture method
for example, see Fig. 4C in
  <span class="citation"><a href="#Meienberg2015">Meienberg <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>.</p>

<p>This step will creates four files in the history. The sizes of those two files vary depending on the original data quality and trimming intensity. The first two files are for mated forward and reverse reads, respectively.
The other two are for unmated reads as a result of excessive trimming.
However, because of the high average data quality, there was no need to perform excessive trimming by selecting the previous three trimming conditions, so those files should be empty. Those files can be heden to keep the history cleaner.</p>

  <p>Track whether the reads are paired or unpaired, and remember to include them in any tool to be used.
The reason is that there are some tools, such as read mappers,
that expect reads to be in a specific order and having unmapped reads can result in significant.</p>

<p>It is essential to filtrate the reads before the mapping step.
It is also required to filtrate the reads after. The preprocessing step
works by filtrating the mapped reads by removing the low-quality regions
and the duplicated reads. This step is needed to reduce the running time
and in results interpretation.</p>

<h2 id="homogenize-mapped-reads">Homogenize mapped reads</h2>

<p>To detect hCNVs expression accurately. The reads must go through the lift alignment process. Lift Alignment works by shifting reads that contain indels to the left of a reference genome until they can not be shifted anymore. As a result, it will only extract reads with indels, with no false reads (reads that mismatch with the reference genome other than the indels).</p>

<p>The data are now ready to detect hCNV. Control-FREEC detects copy-number alterations and allelic imbalances (including loss of heterozygosity; LOH) by automatically computing, normalising, and segmenting copy number profile and beta allele frequency (BAF) profile, and then calling copy number alterations and LOH. Control-FREEC differentiates between somatic and germline variants. Based on those profiles. The control reads display the gene status for each segment.</p>

    <p>The outermost circle represents the targeted chromosomes. 
The inner circle
shows the copy number changes in those regions.</p>

    <p>The inner circle has two parts. The deletion-related variations are the red dots directed to the centre 
(below the centre line), while the amplificated variations are the green dots pointed out of the center (toward chromosomes).</p>
