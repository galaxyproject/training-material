  abstract  = "The DC Cohort is an ongoing longitudinal observational study of
               persons living with HIV. To better understand HIV-1 drug
               resistance and potential transmission clusters among these
               participants, we performed targeted, paired-end next-generation
               sequencing (NGS) of protease, reverse transcriptase and
               integrase amplicons. We elected to use free, publicly-available
               software (HyDRA Web, Stanford HIVdb and HIV-TRACE) for data
               analyses so that laboratory personnel without extensive
               bioinformatics expertise could use it; making the approach
               accessible and affordable for labs worldwide. With more
               laboratories transitioning away from Sanger-based chemistries to
               NGS platforms, lower frequency drug resistance mutations (DRMs)
               can be detected, yet their clinical relevance is uncertain. We
               looked at the impact choice in cutoff percentage had on number
               of DRMs detected and found an inverse correlation between the
               two. Longitudinal studies will be needed to determine whether
               low frequency DRMs are an early indicator of emerging
               resistance. We successfully validated this pipeline against a
               commercial pipeline, and another free, publicly-available
               pipeline. RT DRM results from HyDRA Web were compared to both
               SmartGene and PASeq Web; using the Mantel test, R2 values were
               0.9332 (p<0.0001) and 0.9097 (p<0.0001), respectively. PR and IN
               DRM results from HyDRA Web were then compared with PASeq Web
               only; using the Mantel test, R2 values were 0.9993 (p<0.0001)
               and 0.9765 (p<0.0001), respectively. Drug resistance was highest
               for the NRTI drug class and lowest for the PI drug class in this
               cohort. RT DRM interpretation reports from this pipeline were
               also highly correlative compared to SmartGene pipeline; using
               the Spearman's Correlation, rs value was 0.97757 (p<0.0001).
               HIV-TRACE was used to identify potential transmission clusters
               to better understand potential linkages among an urban cohort of
               persons living with HIV; more individuals were male, of black
               race, with an HIV risk factor of either MSM or High-risk
               Heterosexual. Common DRMs existed among individuals within a
               cluster. In summary, we validated a comprehensive, easy-to-use
               and affordable NGS approach for tracking HIV-1 drug resistance
               and identifying potential transmission clusters within the
               community.",
