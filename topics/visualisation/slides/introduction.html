# What is Data Visualisation

- Making graphics to clearly convey data
- Many different options

![Selection of numerous graph types include pie, dot, bar, line charts, map and guages.](../images/chart_types.png)

---

# What is Data Visualisation

- More than just scatter plots and bar charts
- Many domain-specific
  - Protein folding, network graphs, trees, genome browsers

![Examples of 6 different visualisations in galaxy features an MSA, a couple graphs, RNA structure, and 3d visualisations of proteins](../../dev/images/charts_examples2.png)

## Why visualizations?

.pull-left[
- *"A picture is worth 1000 words"*

- Anscombe's Quartet

- All these datasets share the same basic statistics:

  ```python
  X mean: 54.26, X SD: 16.76
  Y mean: 47.83, Y SD: 26.93
  Correlation: -0.06
  ```

- But visualisation reveals vastly different underlying structures!

.image-90[![Animated gif cycling through Anscombe's quartet and various variations that all have the same mean, SD, and correlation but look vastly different to someone's eyes.](../../dev/images/anscombe-quartet-animated.gif)]
]


???
Anscombes quartet, all these datasets have same mean, standard deviation and correlation,
yet when visualizing them it is revealed they have vastly different structures.

## Data Visualisation in Galaxy

---

## Genome Browsers

- Visualize the genome
  - mapped sequence reads, variants, genes, ..

![JBrowse screenshot](../images/jbrowse/sequencing.png)

---

## Genome Browsers in Galaxy

- As display applications
  - e.g. UCSC browser, IBV, IGB, ..
  - accessed via links on dataset

    ![screenshot of display options](../images/display_options_bam.png)

---

## JBrowse

- Genome browser as a regular tool
- Configure your settings

.image-75[ ![Screenshot of Galaxy showing the configuration interface for JBrowse.](../images/jbrowse_tool.png) ]


???

- JBrowse is not a display application like the previous examples
- Regular Galaxy tool

---

## JBrowse

- Then interactively explore your genome

.image-75[![Screenshot of JBrowse showing sequence, some bar charts, a SNP map highlighting snps, and aligned reads.](../images/jbrowse/sequencing.png)]


---

## Galaxy Charts

- Accessed through Charts icon {% icon galaxy-barchart %} on dataset
- Different options depending on datatype

![Example of list of Galaxy charts](../images/charts_list.png)

---

## Galaxy Charts

- After selecting chart type, can customize settings
- Example: Protein Viewer

  ![Configuration for the protein viewer is shown on the left, a 3d structure of a protein shown on the right](../../dev/images/charts_pdbviewer.png)

---

## Visualisation Tools

- Many tools for visualisation
- Example: Circos for circular data plots


![Sample Circos images](../images/circos-sample-panel.png)
