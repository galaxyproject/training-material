1. Install [IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download) (if not already installed)
2. Launch IGV on your computer
3. Check if the reference genome is available on the IGV instance
4. Expand the BAM dataset with the mapped reads in the history
5. Click on the `local` in `display with IGV` to load the reads into the IGV browser
6. Switch to the IGV instance

   The mapped reads track should appear. Be sure that all files have the same genome ID
