# JBrowse for Genomics Visualisation

---

### What is JBrowse

.pull-left[
- Interactive genome browser
- HTML5 / Javascript
- Process data + copy directory to a webserver
- Can be deployed to apache/nginx, S3 buckets, etc.
- Many [plugins](https://gmod.github.io/jbrowse-registry/) available for
  - Themes
  - Datatype support (mafviewer, agp_parser)
  - Third party data integration (GA4GH, MyVariantViewer)
  - Visualisations (GC Content track, Sashimi for RNAseq)
  - More
]

### JBrowse in Galaxy

- Tool that produces a JBrowse instance (client side code + processed data)
- Workflow compatible
- Covers *most* of the possibilities of JBrowse
- Supports many Galaxy datatypes:
	- GFF3 / GBK /BED
	- BAM (SAM)
	- (big)Wig
	- Blast XML
	- VCF
	- REST/SPARQL endpoints
- Complex JBrowse made easy (Thanks Galaxy!)

### Built in Provenance Tracking

- "ComboTrackSelector" supports attaching metadata to tracks + filtering
- We attached Galaxy metadata
	- Dataset Creator
	- Dataset Job Parameters
	- Tool + Version
	- Date
- Can "build on top of" existing JBrowses, adding more data. Complete history tracked.

### Why is this Necessary?

- JBrowse allows you to present Galaxy analysis workflows in a single visualisation
- Researchers generally understand genome browsers
- When annotation, not just visualisation, is needed, the JBrowse instances can be sent to Apollo
- Apollo allows for collaborative genome annotation and curation
- Check out the Apollo tutorials for more details: [prokaryotes]({% link topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/apollo/tutorial.md %}) - [eukaryotes]({% link topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/apollo-euk/tutorial.md %})

### Why do you need this?

- You are running genome annotation or genomic data analysis workflows
- Researchers need more visual outputs than tables of data
- Datasets can be more valuable visualised together, rather than as separate lines in a report
