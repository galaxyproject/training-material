### JBrowse in Galaxy

- Tool that produces a JBrowse instance (client side code + processed data)
- Covers *most* of the possibilities of JBrowse
- Supports many Galaxy datatypes:
	- GFF3 / GBK /BED
	- BAM (SAM)
	- (big)Wig
	- Blast XML*
	- VCF
	- REST/SPARQL* endpoints
- Complex JBrowse made easy (Thanks Galaxy!)

### Built in Provenance Tracking

- "ComboTrackSelector" supports attaching metadata to tracks + filtering
- We attached Galaxy metadata
	- Dataset Creator
	- Dataset Job Parameters
	- Tool + Version
	- Date
- Can "build on top of" existing JBrowses, adding more data. Complete history tracked.

### Building a JBrowse Instance

- Select reference genome
- Select datasets
	- Give them some fun colors (by default brewer palette)
	- Configure rich linking to external resources
	- Make some stylistic decisions
- Click "yes/no" buttons to enable + auto-configure plugins
- *Execute*
