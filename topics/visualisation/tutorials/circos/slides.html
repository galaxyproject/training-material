# Circos for Genomics Visualisation

---

### What is Circos

- Circular Graphics
- Complex + Finnicky configuration
- ... but beautiful visualisations
- Can visualise a huge range of data types

???
Many researchers find Circos overwhelming and complex. This tool can save them time and we will hopefully show them how to reproduce several plots from published papers.

---

### Circos in Galaxy

- Tool that produces a Circos Plot (PNG / SVG)
- Workflow compatible
- **Does only 90% of the work**
- The last 10% (ok plot → amazing plot) is up to you (may require manual work.)
- Outputs configuration directory for manual tweaking

???
Emphasize that it will not produce production quality plots without a lot of work. We are actively trying to support as many of the features as possible from circos but there are some features we cannot support easily. Sometimes this means that they will have to download + install circos locally and then manually edit their configuration files.

We cannot support them uploading these edited config files into Galaxy because of potential security issues (circos can shell out.)

### Supported Features

- Covers *most* of the possibilities of Circos
- Can auto convert GFF3/BED/(big)Wig datasets into appropriate formats
- Supports common Circos features like:
	- histograms
	- heatmaps
	- "tile" (from gff3/bed)
	- line
	- scatter
	- ribbons
- Complex Circos visualisations made easy (Thanks Galaxy!)

### Tracks: Histograms

### Tracks: Heatmaps

### Tracks: Tiles


???
"Tile tracks are used to show spans such as genomic regions (genes, exons, duplications) or coverage elements (clones, sequence reads). Tiles will stack within their track to avoid overlap." (circos documentation)

### Tracks: Scatter


???

### Tracks: Lines

### Tracks: Ribbons
