After sequencing and assembly, a genome can be annotated. It is an essential step to describe the genome.

Genome annotation consists in describing the structure and function of the components of the genome, by predicting, analyzing, and interpreting them in order to extract their biological significance and understand the biological processes in which they participate. Among other things, it identifies the locations of genes and all the coding regions in a genome (*structural annotation*) and determines what those genes do (*functional annotation*).

To illustrate the process to annotate a bacterial genome, we take an assembly of a bacterial genome (KUN1163 sample) generated by following a [bacterial genome assembly tutorial]({% link topics/assembly/tutorials/mrsa-illumina/tutorial.md %}) from data produced in "Complete Genome Sequences of Eight Methicillin-Resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* Strains Isolated from Patients in Japan" ({% cite Hikichi_2019 %}).

> Methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) is a major pathogen
> causing nosocomial infections, and the clinical manifestations of MRSA
> range from asymptomatic colonization of the nasal mucosa to soft tissue
> infection to fulminant invasive disease. Here, we report the complete
> genome sequences of eight MRSA strains isolated from patients in Japan.

# Galaxy and data preparation

Any analysis should get its own Galaxy history. So let's start by creating a new one and get the data (contig file from the assembly) into it.

# Contig annotation

For annotating the contigs, several tools exists to do that: Prokka ({% cite seemann2014prokka %}), Bakta ({% cite schwengers2021bakta %}), etc. Here, we use **Bakta** as recommended by {% include _includes/contributor-badge.html id="tseemann" %} as the successor of **Prokka**.

**Bakta** is a tool for the rapid & standardized annotation of bacterial genomes and plasmids from both isolates and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). It implements a comprehensive annotation workflow for coding and non-coding genes (*i.e.* tRNA, rRNA).

![Flow diagram of Bakta. It depicts the sequential steps and connections involved in its functioning.](./images/bakta_wf.png "Overview of the Bakta annotation workflow ({% cite schwengers2021bakta %})")

It is also able to detect and annotate small proteins (sORF). Predicted CDS are annotated using an alignment-free protein sequence identification approach with cross-references to public databases via stable identifiers.

- `Annotation_and_sequences` in GFF3

   GFF is a file format used for describing genes and other features of DNA, RNA and protein sequences. It is a tab delimited file with 9 fields per line:

   1. **seqid**: The name of the sequence where the feature is located.
   2. **source**: The algorithm or procedure that generated the feature. This is typically the name of a software or database.
   3. **type**: The feature type name, like "gene" or "exon". In a well structured GFF file, all the children features always follow their parents in a single block (so all exons of a transcript are put after their parent "transcript" feature line and before any other parent transcript line). In GFF3, all features and their relationships should be compatible with the standards released by the Sequence Ontology Project.
   4. **start**: Genomic start of the feature, with a 1-base offset. This is in contrast with other 0-offset half-open sequence formats, like BED.
   5. **end**: Genomic end of the feature, with a 1-base offset. This is the same end coordinate as it is in 0-offset half-open sequence formats, like BED.
   6. **score**: Numeric value that generally indicates the confidence of the source in the annotated feature. A value of "." (a dot) is used to define a null value.
   7. **strand**: Single character that indicates the strand of the feature. This can be "+" (positive, or 5'->3'), "-", (negative, or 3'->5'), "." (undetermined), or "?" for features with relevant but unknown strands.
   8. **phase**: phase of CDS features; it can be either one of 0, 1, 2 (for CDS features) or "." (for everything else). See the section below for a detailed explanation.
   9. **attributes**: A list of tag-value pairs separated by a semicolon with additional information about the feature.

# Further structural annotation

**Bakta** gives a lot of information already, especially regarding CDSs or RNAs, but some structural annotation might be missing, e.g. plasmids, or interesting to identify independently.

## Plasmids

To identify plasmids in our contigs, we use **PlasmidFinder** ({% cite carattoli2020plasmidfinder %}), a tool for the identification and typing of plasmid sequences in Whole-Genome Sequencing. It uses the [plasmidfinder database](https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/plasmidfinder_db/) with hundreds of sequences to predict the plasmid in the data.

> <hands-on-title> Plasmid identification</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [PlasmidFinder](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/plasmidfinder/plasmidfinder/2.1.6+galaxy1) %} with the following parameters:
>    - In *"Input parameters"*:
>        - {% icon param-file %} *"Choose a fasta or fastq file"*: Contig file
>        - *"PlasmidFinder database"*: most recent one
{: .hands_on}

**PlasmidFinder** generates several outputs:

- `raw_results.txt`: A text file containing the result table and alignments
- `results.tsv`: A tabular file with the following columns:

   - **Database**
   - **Plasmid**: Plasmid against which the input genome has been aligned.
   - **Identity**: Percent identity in the alignment between the best matching plasmid in the database and the corresponding sequence in the inputgenome (also called the high-scoring segment pair (HSP)). A perfect alignment is 100%, but must also cover the entire length of the plasmid in the database (compare example 1 and 3).
   - **Query/Template Length**: Query length is the length of the best matching plasmid in the database, while HSP length is the length of the alignment between the best matching plasmid and the corresponding sequence in the genome (also called the high-scoring segment pair (HSP)).
   - **Contig**: Name of contig the plasmid is found in.
   - **Position in contig**: Starting position of the found gene in the contig.
   - **Note**: Notes about the plasmid
   - **Accession number**: Reference Genbank accession number accoding to NCBI for the plasmid in the database.

   > > 4. All plasmid sequences corresponding to *Staphylococcus aureus* plasmids are all on contig00019, making this contig likely a plasmid. In addition, this contig has a length of 30,347 bp, which is similar to the expected length of the plasmid for KUN1163 in [Table 1](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mra.01212-19#tab1) in {% cite Hikichi_2019 %}

## Integrons

Integrons are genetic mechanisms that allow bacteria to adapt and evolve rapidly through the stockpiling and expression of new genes. An integron is minimally composed of:

- a gene encoding for a site-specific recombinase (intI)
- a proximal recombination site (attI), which is recognized by the integrase and at which gene cassettes may be inserted
- a promoter (Pc) which directs transcription of cassette-encoded genes

To detect integrons, we will use **IntegronFinder** ({% cite neron2022integronfinder %}). This tool:

1. Annotates the CDS with **Prodigal**
2. Detects independently:

   1. integron integrase using the intersection of two HMM profiles: one specific of tyrosine-recombinase (PF00589) and one specific of the integron integrase, near the patch III domain of tyrosine recombinases
   2. attC recombination sites with a covariance model (CM), which models the secondary structure in addition to the few conserved sequence positions.

3. Integrates the results to distinguish 3 types of elements

   - Complete integron: Integron with integron integrase nearby attC site(s)
   - In0 element: Integron integrase only, without any attC site nearby
   - CALIN element: Cluster of attC sites Lacking INtegrase nearby

> <hands-on-title> Integron identification</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [IntegronFinder](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/integron_finder/integron_finder/2.0.5+galaxy0) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Replicon file"*: Contig file
>    - *"Thorough local detection"*: `Yes`
>    - *"Search also for promoter and attI sites?"*: `Yes`
>    - *"Remove log file"*: `Yes`
>
{: .hands_on}

**IntegronFinder** generates 2 outputs:

- A summary with for each sequence in the input the number of identified CALIN elements, In0 elements, and complete integrons.

   >
   > How many integron elements have been found?

   > > <solution-title></solution-title>

## IS (Insertion Sequence) elements

Insertion sequence (IS) element is a short DNA sequence that acts as a simple transposable element. IS are the smallest but most abundant autonomous transposable elements in bacterial genomes.  They only code for proteins implicated in the transposition activity. They play then a key role in bacterial genome organization and evolution.

To detect IS elements, we will use **ISEScan** ({% cite xie2017isescan %}). **ISEScan** is a highly sensitive software pipeline based on profile hidden Markov models constructed from manually curated IS elements

> <hands-on-title> IS identification </hands-on-title>

{: .hands_on}

**ISEScan** generates several files:

- A summary as a table

- The results as a table

# Visualisation of the annotation

We would like to look at the annotation using [JBrowse](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/) ({% cite diesh2023jbrowse %}) with several information:

1. Annotations identified by **Bakta**
2. Plasmid sequences identified by **PlasmidFinder**
3. Integrons identified by **IntegronFinder**
4. IS elements identified by **ISEscan**

**JBrowse** needs the annotations to be in GFF format. **Bakta** and **ISEscan** generated both GFF files. For **PlasmidFinder** and **IntegronFinder**, we need to format the outputs.

**PlasmidFinder** generated the `results.tsv` with all needed information. To transform it to a GFF, we need to:

1. Split the 6th column on `..` to have start and end into 2 separated columns
2. Remove in the content of column 5 what is after the contig name
2. Remove the 1st line
3. Transform to GFF3

{: .hands_on}

In the output of the JBrowse you can view the genes, IS, plasmid, etc on the contigs. With the search tools you can easily find genes of interest. JBrowse can handle many inputs and can be very useful.

If it takes too long to build the JBrowse instance, you can view an embedded one here:

To learn more options for **JBrowse**, check out the [dedicated tutorial]({% link topics/visualisation/tutorials/jbrowse/tutorial.md %})

# Conclusion

In this tutorial, contigs were annotated with different tools and then visualized.

Other visualizations, specially for publications, can be done using **Circos**. To learn how to do it, you can follow the [dedicated tutorial]({% link topics/visualisation/tutorials/circos-microbial/tutorial.md %}).

To refine the genome annotation, you can also use **Apollo** and our [tutorial]({% link topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/apollo/tutorial.md %}).
