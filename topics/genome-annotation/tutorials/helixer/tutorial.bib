	abstract = {Gene structural annotation is a critical step in obtaining biological knowledge from genome sequences yet remains a major challenge in genomics projects. Current de novo Hidden Markov Models are limited in their capacity to model biological complexity; while current pipelines are resource-intensive and their results vary in quality with the available extrinsic data. Here, we build on our previous work in applying Deep Learning to gene calling to make a fully applicable, fast and user friendly tool for predicting primary gene models from DNA sequence alone. The quality is state-of-the-art, with predictions scoring closer by most measures to the references than to predictions from other de novo tools. Helixer{\textquoteright}s predictions can be used as is or could be integrated in pipelines to boost quality further. Moreover, there is substantial potential for further improvements and advancements in gene calling with Deep Learning.Helixer is open source and available at https://github.com/weberlab-hhu/HelixerA web interface is available at https://www.plabipd.de/helixer_main.htmlCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

    abstract = "{Evaluating the gene completeness is critical to measuring the quality of a genome assembly. An incomplete assembly can lead to errors in gene predictions, annotation, and other downstream analyses. Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) is a widely used tool for assessing the completeness of genome assembly by testing the presence of a set of single-copy orthologs conserved across a wide range of taxa. However, BUSCO is slow particularly for large genome assemblies. It is cumbersome to apply BUSCO to a large number of assemblies.Here, we present compleasm, an efficient tool for assessing the completeness of genome assemblies. Compleasm utilizes the miniprot protein-to-genome aligner and the conserved orthologous genes from BUSCO. It is 14 times faster than BUSCO for human assemblies and reports a more accurate completeness of 99.6\\% than BUSCO’s 95.7\\%, which is in close agreement with the annotation completeness of 99.5\\% for T2T-CHM13.https://github.com/huangnengCSU/compleasm.}",
