Annotating the eukaryotic genome represents a somewhat more complex challenge than that of prokaryotes, mainly due to the generally larger size of eukaryotic genomes and their greater number of genes, but also to the complexity of eukaryotic genes structure (e.g. exons and {UTR}). This annotation can be carried out at different levels of precision, ranging from simple identification of coding and non-coding parts to detailed structural labeling, including for example the precise location of exons, introns and other regulatory elements.


In this tutorial we will use a software tool called Helixer to annotate the genome sequence of a small eukaryote: [*Mucor mucedo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucor_mucedo) (a fungal plant pathogen).

[Helixer](https://github.com/weberlab-hhu/Helixer) is an annotation software with a new and different approach: it performs evidence-free predictions (no need for RNASeq data or sequence aligments), using {GPU}, with a much faster execution time. The annotation is based on the development and use of a cross-species deep learning model. The software is used to configure and train models for *ab initio* prediction of gene structure. In other words, it identifies the base pairs in a genome that belong to the UTR/CDS/Intron genes.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to perform a structural annotation of the genome and how to assess its quality.

# Data upload

To annotate our genome using Helixer, we will use the following files:

- The **genome sequence** in fasta format. For this tutorial, we will try to annotate the genome assembled in the [Flye assembly tutorial]({% link topics/assembly/tutorials/flye-assembly/tutorial.md %}). (Note: Helixer will ignore soft-masking. Hard-masking is not recommnded for Helixer either, as it does not ignore the hard-masked regions, but will get less information from them, which could influence your predictions in a negative way.)

# Structural annotation

We can run [**Helixer**](https://github.com/weberlab-hhu/Helixer) to perform the structural annotation of the genome.

We need to input the genome sequence we want to annotate.

We also need to choose between 4 different lineages: *invertebrate*, *vertebrate*, *land plant* or *fungi*. Select the one that fits the best to the species you're studying: *fungi* in our case. Helixer is shipped with these 4 models that were trained specifically to annotate genes from each of these lineages. Advanced users can upload their own lineage model in .h5 format with the *"Lineage model"* option.

As an option, we can also enter a species name.

Helixer produces a single output dataset: a GFF3 file. The GFF3 format is a standard bioinformatics format for storing genome annotations. Each row describes a genomic entity, with columns detailing its identifier, location, score and other attributes.

# Quality evaluation

## General statistics

Genome Annotation Statistics is a program designed to analyze and provide statistics on genomic annotations. This software performs its analyses from a GFF3 file.

>    - In *"Reference genome"*: select `Use a genome from history`
>    - In *"Corresponding genome sequence"*: `genome_masked.fasta` (Input dataset)
{: .hands_on}

Two output files are generated:
- a file containing graphs in pdf format
- a summary in txt format

> <comment-title>What can we deduce from these results?</comment-title>

> - The summary file provides statistics on the genome annotation and gives a complete overview of the genomic structure and characteristics of the genes, exons and introns in the analysed genome.
> - We can see that there are 19,299 genes, 77% of which are multi-exons (i.e. 14,860) and 23% single-exons (i.e. 4,439).
> - We can obtain other information such as the average size of exons, the percentage in GC or the average size of transcripts.

These statistics are interesting on their own: you often have a rough idea of the expected number of genes or mean length when annotating a new genome, by comparing with published similar species. You can also use them to compare the quality of annotations produced by different tools.

## Evaluation with **Busco**

[BUSCO](http://busco.ezlab.org/) (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) is a tool allowing to evaluate the quality of a genome assembly or of a genome annotation. By comparing genomes from various more or less related species, the authors determined sets of ortholog genes that are present in single copy in (almost) all the species of a clade (Bacteria, Fungi, Plants, Insects, Mammalians, ...). Most of these genes are essential for the organism to live, and are expected to be found in any newly sequenced and annotated genome from the corresponding clade. Using this data, BUSCO is able to evaluate the proportion of these essential genes (also named BUSCOs) found in a set of (predicted) transcript or protein sequences. This is a good evaluation of the "completeness" of the annotation.

As an alternative for genomes only one can use [**compleasm**](https://github.com/huangnengCSU/compleasm) with the same BUSCO gene sets, as compleasm is a bit more sensitive and thus allows finding slightly more conserved genes. 

We want to run BUSCO on the protein sequences predicted from gene sequences of the Helixer annotation. So first generate these sequences:

> 1. {% tool [GFFread](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/gffread/gffread/2.2.1.4+galaxy0) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Input GFF3 or GTF feature file"*: output of {% tool [Helixer](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/genouest/helixer/helixer/0.3.3+galaxy1)) %}
>    - In *"Reference Genome"* select: `From your history` (Input dataset)
>    - *"Genome Reference Fasta"*: `masked genome` (Input dataset)
>    - In *"Select fasta outputs"* select: `protein fasta file with the translation of CDS for each record (-y)`
>    - *"full GFF attribute preservation (all attributes are shown)"*: `Yes`
>    - *"decode url encoded characters within attributes"*: `Yes`
>    - *"warn about duplicate transcript IDs and other potential problems with the given GFF/GTF records"*: `Yes`
>
{: .hands_on}

To run BUSCO on these protein sequences:

> <hands-on-title>BUSCO in proteome mode</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [Busco](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/busco/busco/5.5.0+galaxy0) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Sequences to analyse"*: `gffread: pep.fa`
>    - *"Mode"*: `annotated gene sets (protein)`
>    - *"Auto-detect or select lineage?"*: `Select lineage`
>        - *"Lineage"*: `Mucorales`
>    - In *"Advanced Options"*:
>        - *"Which outputs should be generated"*: select all outputs
>
{: .hands_on}

Several output files are generated:

- short summary : statistical summary of the quality of genomic assembly or annotation, including total number of genes evaluated, percentage of complete genes, percentage of partial genes, etc.
- full table : list of universal orthologs found in the assembled or annotated genome, with information on their completeness, location in the genome, quality score, etc.
- missing buscos : list of orthologs not found in the genome, which may indicate gaps in assembly or annotation.
- summary image : graphics and visualizations to visually represent the results of the evaluation, such as bar charts showing the proportion of complete, partial and missing genes.
- GFF : contain information on gene locations, exons, introns, etc.

This gives information about the completeness of the Helixer annotation. A good idea is to compare this first result with the one you get on the initial genome sequence, and see if the annotation tool found all the genes that BUSCO finds in the raw genome sequence. So run BUSCO in genome mode:

>
{: .hands_on}

> <comment-title>What can we deduce from these results?</comment-title>
>
> - 94.6% of genes are complete, so the annotation is of high quality in terms of genomic completeness.
> - It is a little bit lower than what BUSCO is able to find in genome mode (95.7%), but the difference is quite small so Helixer seems to have generated a quite good result.
> - The duplication rate is low, with 1.3% and 1.5% of genes duplicated.
> - So the Helixer annotation looks like a good one, with high completeness and low duplication.

## Evaluation with **OMArk**

[OMArk](https://github.com/DessimozLab/OMArk) is proteome quality assessment software. It provides measures of proteome completeness, characterises the consistency of all protein-coding genes with their homologues and identifies the presence of contamination by other species. OMArk is based on the OMA orthology database, from which it exploits orthology relationships, and on the OMAmer software for rapid placement of all proteins in gene families.

OMArk's analysis is based on HOGs (Hierarchical Orthologous Groups), which play a central role in its assessment of the completeness and coherence of gene sets. HOGs make it possible to compare the genes of a given species with groups of orthologous genes conserved across a taxonomic clade. 

> <hands-on-title>OMArk on extracted protein sequences</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [OMArk](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/omark/omark/0.3.0+galaxy2) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Protein sequences"*: `gffread: pep.fa`
>    - *"OMAmer database*: select `LUCA-v2.0.0`
>    - In *"Which outputs should be generated"*: select `Detailed summary`
>
{: .hands_on}

The OMArk tool generated an output file in .txt format containing detailed information on the assessment of the completeness, consistency and species composition of the proteome analysed. This report includes statistics on conserved genes, the proportion of duplications, missing genes and the identification of reference lineages.

> <comment-title>What can we deduce from these results?</comment-title>
>
> - Number of conserved HOGs: OMArk has identified a set of 5622 HOGs which are thought to be conserved in the majority of species in the Mucorineae clade.
> - 85.52% of genes are complete, so the annotation is of good quality in terms of genomic completeness.
> - Number of proteins in the whole proteome: 19 299. Of which 62.83% are present and 30.94% of the proteome does not share sufficient similarities with known gene families.
> - No contamination detected.
> - The OMArk analysis is based on the Mucorineae lineage, a more recent and specific clade than that used in the BUSCO assessment, which selected the Mucorales as the reference group.

# Visualisation with a genome browser

You can visualize the annotation generated using a genomic browser like [JBrowse](https://jbrowse.org/jbrowse1.html). This browser enables you to navigate along the chromosomes of the genome and view the structure of each predicted gene.
