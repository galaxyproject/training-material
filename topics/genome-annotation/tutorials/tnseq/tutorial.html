                <p>In microbiology, identifying links between genotype and phenotype is key to understand bacteria growth and virulence mechanisms, and to identify targets for drugs and vaccines. These analysis are limited by the lack of bacterial genome annotations (<em>e.g.</em> 30% of genes for <em>S. pneumoniae</em> are of unknown function) and by the fact that genotypes often arose from complex composant interactions.</p>

<h2 id="transposon-insertion-sequencing">Transposon insertion Sequencing</h2>

<p>Transposon insertion sequencing is a technique used to functionally annotate bacterial genomes. In this technique, the genome is saturated by insertions of transposons. Transposons are highly regulated, discrete DNA segments that can relocate within the genome. They have a large influence on gene expression and can be used to determine the function of genes.</p>

<p>When a transposon inserts itself in a gene, the gene’s function will be disrupted, affecting the fitness (growth) of the bacteria. We can then manipulate transposons for use in insertional mutagenesis, <em>i.e.</em> creation of mutations of DNA by the addition of transposons. The genomes can be then sequenced to locate the transposon insertion site and the function affected by a transposon insertion can be linked to the disrupted gene.</p>

    <p><strong>Data production</strong> (<strong>a</strong> in the previous image)</p>

    <p>An initial population of genomes is mutated so that the genome of the bacteria is saturated with transposon insertions. A library is called <em>saturated</em> if in the genomes across the whole population of bacteria, each potential insertion site has at least one insertion. The population is then divided into several media containing different growth conditions, to identify the impact of the insertions on the bacteria growth. After growth, the regions flanking the insertion are amplified and sequenced, allowing to determine the location of the insertion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Analysis</strong> (<strong>b</strong> in the previous image)</p>

    <p>The sequences are aligned to the reference genome to identify the location of the regions flanking the insertions. The resulting data will show a discrete repartition of reads on each site. If a gene present several insertions, like the two leftmost genes in <em>Condition A</em>, it means that its disruption has little or no impact to the bacterial growth. On the other hand, when a gene shows no insertions at all, like the rightmost gene in <em>Condition A</em>, is means that any disruption in this gene killed the bacteria, meaning it is a gene essential to bacteria survival. If the library is sufficiently saturated, there is a clear threshold between essential and non-essential genes when you analyze the insertion rate per gene.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Two type of transposon insertion methods exist:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gene disruption, where we analyze only the disruptions. This will covered by of this tutorial</li>
  <li>Regulatory element insertion, where different promoters are inserted by the transposon, and we analyze the change in gene expression in addition to the disruption. This method will be the subject of another tutorial.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="building-a-tnseq-library">Building a TnSeq library</h2>

<p>Different types of transposons can be used depending of the goal of your analysis.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Randomly pooled transposon
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Mariner-based transposons, common and stable transposons which target the “TA” dinucleotides</p>

        <p>The TA are distributed relatively evenly along genome. The Mariner-based transposons can be inserted to impact statistically every gene, with in average more than 30 insertions site per kb. With the low insertion bias, it is easy to build saturated libraries. But local variations means less loci and less statistical power.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Tn5-based vectors, which insert at random sites</p>

        <p>This transposon do not require any target sequences. It is useful for specie where it is difficult to build mariner based transposons. But it has a preference for high GC content, causing insertion bias</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Defined sequence transposon</p>

    <p>It can be used to study interactions in pathways of interest, but also more precise targeting (small genes, pathways) for specific analyses</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Independently of the transposon choice we need to be careful about the library complexity. With a large complex library, multiple insertion can be found in every potential locus. The higher density of insertion, the greater precision in identifying limits of regions of interest. If the density of the library is too low, some genes might by chance not be disrupted and mistaken for essential. The advantage of a target specific transposon, like the mariner, in opposition of a Tn5-based transposon inserting randomly, it that the limited number of insertion sites makes it easier to build high complexity libraries.</p>

<p>After selection of the type of transposon, we need to modify it to allow insertion site amplification and sequencing to get a library fitting the transposon insertion. Biases could be introduced during the process due to uneven fragment sizes. To avoid that, we can introduce a Type I restriction site to cleave DNA downstream of transposon, and get uniform fragment sizes and therefore avoid a bias in the representation of the insertions.</p>

<p>As we just want to identify the TA site affected by an insertion, we only need the location of the start of the reads and not a good coverage of the entire genome. Long reads are then not so important. On the other hand, a minimum transposon length of 16 bp is necessary for precise mapping on the genome <span class="citation"><a href="#Kwon2015">Kwon <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>. We can therefore not use the BsmFI restriction site (11 to 12 bp) but MmeI.</p>

<p><strong>In this tutorial, we are using mariner transposon targeting TA sequences, in ordered to target the whole genome uniformly,</strong> with two specific regions used to specifically sequence the region upstream of the insertion <span class="citation"><a href="#Santiago2015">Santiago <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span></p>

<figure id="figure-2" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/tnseq/tranposon_structure.png" alt="Structure of the transposon containing several parcodes and adapters. " width="1284" height="1045" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/tnseq/tranposon_structure.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 2</strong>:</span> Structure of the transposon containing several parcodes and adapters (from <a href="#Santiago2015"> Santiago <i>et al.</i> 2015</a>)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The transposon inserts itself at TA site at the ITR junctions. These ITR junctions have been modified to include a Mme1 restriction site and a NotI restriction site which cut 21 bp upstream the restriction site. These two site are the 5’ and 3’ limits to the genomic DNA we want to sequence.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>After digestion by NotI restriction enzyme, the fragments are attached to biotinylated adaptors that link to NotI restriction site. The attached fragment are then digested by MMeI at a site upstream, where an Illumina primer is then linked. The sequencing is then done, adding Illumina adaptors and an additional barcode to the read for multiplexed sequencing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An insertion can sometimes be composed of one or more copies of the transposon (multimer). There is therefore a risk to select plasmid backbone sequence. To solve this problem, an additional NotI has been added in the backbone to create different length construct, that can later be filtrated. Different promoters are added with an additional 3 bp barcode to analyze differential expression impact. This type of complex analysis will be covered in a follow-up tutorial.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Because of this complex transposon structure, the reads obtained after sequencing contain a lot of adapters and foreign sequences used to insert and target the transposon. Several steps of preprocessing are then need to extract only the transposon sequence before finding its location on the genome.</p>

<h2 id="tnseq-analysis">Tnseq analysis</h2>

<p>Once the genomic sequences are extracted from the initial reads (<em>i.e.</em> remove non genomic sequences from the reads), they need to be located each on the genome to link them to a TA site and genes. To do that we map them to a reference genome, link them to a specific insertion site, and then count the number of insertion for each TA site and identify essential genes of regions.</p>

<p>We will apply this approach in this tutorial using a subset of TnSeq reads from <span class="citation"><a href="#Santiago2015">Santiago <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>.</p>

<h1 id="remove-all-non-genomic-sequences-from-the-sequenced-reads">Remove all non genomic sequences from the sequenced reads</h1>

<p>Because of the experimental design for transposon insertion sequencing, the raw reads contain a lot of adapters and foreign sequences used to insert and target the transposon. To obtain the core reads that contain only genomic sequence, the reads have to go through several steps (using the <strong>Cutadapt</strong> tool) to remove them and divide the reads per experimental condition and type of transposon:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We separate the reads of each experimental condition based on a 8 bp barcode at the beginning of each read. These barcodes were added to be able to pool different conditions together before the transposon insertion and sequencing.</li>
  <li>The tail of each set of read is then removed. It immediately follows the 3 bp barcode specific to transposon constructs, and contains illumina adapter sequence and downstream</li>
  <li>To be sure all our reads have been trimmed correctly we filter out the reads too large.</li>
  <li>We then separate the reads per transposon construct</li>
  <li>We remove the remaining transposon sequence containing MmeI.</li>

We need to trim their tail containing the Illumina adapters, used for initiating the sequencing (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CGTTATGGCACGC</code>, here). To do so, we remove the adapter and everything downstream, using the end adapter option of <strong>Cutadapt</strong> and not anchor the sequence anywhere. To eliminate reads that might not have been trimmed because of too many mismatches or other reasons, we filter the reads by size, given the known approximate size of the remaining sequences (<strong>how is it computed??</strong>).</p>

<p>As you can see on the <a href="#figure-4">previous figure</a>, the read can cover one side or the other of the TA depending on the direction of insertion of the transposon. Depending on the direction of insertion the coverage will be counted on the leftmost position of the TA site or on the rightmost. As we are not considering strand separately in this analyses, we will consider both count as attached to the leftmost base of the TA site. To do that we will create two list of TA site positions, listing the 5’ end of each TA site for forward and reverse strand, and then merge them to get a global count per TA site.</p>

<p>We now have a read count for each nucleotide at the different TA sites. The insertions on the forward strand files are in a different direction than those on the reverse strand file. In our case, we are only interested in studying the gene disruption, and therefore we do not want to consider the directions separately. We can then combine the forward and reverse counts together to get a total count per TA site. In order to do that we need to assign the count of both strand to the same nucleotide, by shifting by one position the count on the reverse strand.</p>

<h1 id="predicting-essential-genes-with-transit">Predicting Essential Genes with Transit</h1>

<p>Now that we have the counts of insertions per TA site, we can use them to predict gene essentiality. Several methods exist to identify essential genes of regions. They can be divided in two major categories:</p>

<figure id="figure-5" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/tnseq/type_of_analyses.png" alt="Different types of TnSeq Analyses. " width="867" height="711" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/tnseq/type_of_analyses.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 5</strong>:</span> Methods of TnSeq Analyses (from <a href="#Chao2016"> Chao <i>et al.</i> 2016</a>)</figcaption></figure>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Annotation dependent method</strong></p>

    <p>The total read count an/or percentage of disrupted site are computed per annotated regions. The values are then compared to the rest of the genome to classify the genes into the categories <em>essential</em> or <em>non-essential</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Annotation independent method</strong></p>

    <p>The total read count and/or disrupted sites are computed independently of annotated regions. One of these methods is using a sliding window. Each window is then classified into the categories <em>essential</em> or <em>non-essential</em>. After the windows have been classified, they are linked annotations, and the genes/regions can be classified as <em>essential</em>, <em>non-essential</em>, or <em>domain essential</em> according to the classification of the windows they cover. The same classification can be done using HMM based methods instead of sliding windows. In that case, each insertion site will be predicted as <em>essential</em> or <em>non essential</em> <span class="citation"><a href="#Chao2016">Chao <i>et al.</i> 2016</a></span>).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To predict the essential genes in our datasets, we will use the Transit tool <span class="citation"><a href="#dejesus2015transit">DeJesus <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>.</p>

<h2 id="transit">Transit</h2>

<p>Transit is a software that can be used to analyse TnSeq Data. It is compatible with Mariner and Tn5 transposon. In total, 3 methods are available to assess gene essentiality in one sample.</p>

<h3 id="gumbel-method">Gumbel method</h3>

<p>The Gumbel method performs a gene by gene analysis of essentiality for Mariner data based on the longest consecutive sequence of TA site without insertions in a gene. This allows to identify essential domains regardless of insertion at other location of the gene.</p>

<p>The distribution governing the longest sequence of consecutive non insertion is  characterized by a Gumbel distribution. This distribution is often used to model the distribution of maximums (or minimums) of a variable (See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumbel_distribution">Wikipedia article on Gumbel distribution </a>). The Gumbel distribution is used as a likelihood of non-essentiality, as the longest run of non-insertions should follow what is expected given the global distribution of non-insertion runs. The essential genes, whose runs of empty sites are longer than expected, are modeled through a normalized sigmoid function. This function reflect that any gene can be essential, except the gene were the run of non insertions are too smell to represent a domain.</p>

<p>The total distribution of the maximum run of non-insertion per gene is therefore represented y a bimodal distribution composed of a Gumbel distribution of non-essential genes and a normalized sigmoid function of essential ones. The parameters of these distributions are estimated through a Metropolis–Hastings (MH) sampling procedure <span class="citation"><a href="#dejesus2013bayesian">DeJesus <i>et al.</i> 2013</a></span>).</p>

<p>Using these two distribution, the posterior probability of each distribution is calculated for each gene. Some genes can be classified as “Unclear” if one probability is not winning over the other. Some other can be classified as “Small” if the space of TA sites covered by the gene is insufficient to categorize it (See the <a href="https://transit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transit_methods.html#gumbel">Transit Manual for the Gumbel method</a>).</p>

<p>The HMM method performs a whole genome essentiality analysis for Mariner data. This approach uses the clustering of TA sites along the genome to identify essential regions, and then apply results to the annotation to identify genes containing essential regions. The HMM method provides a classification for each TA site into 4 states : Essential, Non-Essential, Growth Advantage, and Growth Defect.</p>

<p>This method require a well-saturated library and is sensitive to sparse datasets <span class="citation"><a href="#dejesus2013hidden">DeJesus and Ioerger 2013</a></span>.</p>

<h3 id="tn5gaps-method">Tn5Gaps method</h3>

<p>The Tn5Gaps method is a method dedicated to the identification of essential genes in studies using Tn5 transposons. The analysis is performed on the whole genome to identify regions of non insertion overlapping with genes. It is based on a Gumbel analysis method <span class="citation"><a href="#griffin2011high">Griffin <i>et al.</i> 2011</a></span> and adapted to Tn5 transposon specificity. The main difference comes from the fact that Tn5 transposon can insert everywhere, thus
creating libraries with lower insertion rates. The difference from the Gumbel method described above is that the run of non insertion are computer on the whole genome instead of individual genes. The longest run of non insertion considered is not the longest within the gene, but the longest one overlapping the gene.</p>

<h2 id="predict-the-essentiality-of-genes">Predict the essentiality of genes</h2>

<p>In our case, we will use the Gumbel method, because we are using Mariner data and our data look pretty sparse. Gumbel is therefore the safe choice compared to HMM which is more sensitive to sparse data.</p>

<p>In order to use transit, we need to create a an annotation file in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prot_table</code> format, specific to the Transit tool. It can be created this file from a GFF3 from GenBank like the one we uploaded earlier.</p>

<p>Now that we have prepared the annotation file, we can use the count per TA site to predict essential genes using Transit tool, with some customized parameters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The number of sites with a single read could be artefactual. We ignore then counts lower than 2</li>
  <li>A disrupted site that would be very close to the border of the gene may not actually disturb the gene function, and therefore not be an actual signal of disruption. We ignore then insertion near the extremities of the genes.</li>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In this tutorial, we learned how to predict essential genes in different conditions. Although it seems to be a long process, keep in mind that the steps allowing to get the list of TA site does not need to be repeated for each analysis as long as you study the same genome.
For repetitive analyses, the steps are fewer : mapping, coverage, attribution to TA sites, merging of strands and Transit analysis.</p>

<p>This tutorial focused on simple gene essentiality prediction in individual samples. You could be interested in intergenic regions as well, or comparing many samples together. Other methods exist in transit for these goals, that follow the same workflow. It is important to look at your data and to perform quality control to evaluate the coverage and sparsity of your data. This will influence not only the choice of method (HMM does not manage sparse data well), but the choice of parameters for your analysis.</p>

<p>Once you get this list of gene, it is interesting to verify manually the genes classified as essentials. In order to do that, you can visualize the read mapped on your genome by displaying the bam files in IGV.</p>

<p>When looking at the read mapping at the location of predicted essential genes, you may encounter several situation: Some gene will have no read at all mapping to them, some will have an empty region, while other will have no clearly defined empty region but a very low count of reads, possibly indicating a growth defect induced by the gene disruption.</p>

<p>Once you have curated and confirm the genes that appear essential, comparing the annotation of essential genes with the condition of growth will allow you a better understanding of certain mechanism of interest, like the gene involved in resistance to stress for example.</p>

<p>A comparison with published results of essentiality in your organism will be useful but don’t expect to find exactly the same results. The conditions of growth differ from one experiment to another, and can highly influence the detection of essential genes.</p>
