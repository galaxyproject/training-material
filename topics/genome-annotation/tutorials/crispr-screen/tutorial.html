                <p>The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) system is a bacterial immune system that has been modified for genome engineering. This groundbreaking technology resulted in a Nobel Prize for Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna in 2020 (<span class="citation"><a href="#Uyhazi2021">Uyhazi and Bennett 2021</a></span>). CRISPR consists of two components: a guide RNA (gRNA) and a non-specific CRISPR-associated endonuclease (Cas9). The gRNA is a short synthetic RNA composed of a scaffold sequence necessary for Cas9-binding (trRNA) and ~20 nucleotide spacer or targeting sequence which defines the genomic target to be modified (crRNA). Cas9 induces double-stranded breaks (DSB) within the target DNA. The resulting DSB is then repaired by either error-prone Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway or less efficient but high-fidelity Homology Directed Repair (HDR) pathway. The NHEJ pathway is the most active repair mechanism and it leads to small nucleotide insertions or deletions (indels) at the DSB site. This results in in-frame amino acid deletions, insertions or frameshift mutations leading to premature stop codons within the open reading frame (ORF) of the targeted gene. Ideally, the end result is a loss-of-function mutation within the targeted gene; however, the strength of the knockout phenotype for a given mutant cell is ultimately determined by the amount of residual gene function.</p>

<p>The ease of generating gRNAs makes <abbr title="Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats">CRISPR</abbr> one of the most scalable genome editing technologies and it has been recently utilized for genome-wide screens. These screens enable systematic targeting of 1000s of genes, with one gene targeted per cell, to identify genes driving phenotypes, such as cell survival, drug resistance or sensitivity. It is feasible for any laboratory to perform a CRISPR screen (<span class="citation"><a href="#Cluse2018">Cluse <i>et al.</i> 2018</a></span>) and they are being increasingly used to obtain biological insight (<span class="citation"><a href="#Bock2022">Bock <i>et al.</i> 2022</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#Przybyla2021">Przybyla and Gilbert 2021</a></span>). These days, pooled whole-genome knockout, inhibition and activation CRISPR libraries and CRISPR sub-library pools are commonly screened.</p>

<h1 id="preparing-the-reads">Preparing the reads</h1>

<h2 id="data-upload">Data upload</h2>

<p>Here we will demonstrate analysing <abbr title="Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats">CRISPR</abbr> screen using data from <span class="citation"><a href="#Fujihara2020">Fujihara <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>. There are 3 samples from the human esophageal cancer cell line (OACM5.1): a baseline sample taken at time zero (T0-Control), a sample treated with drug for 8 days (T8-APR-246) and a control sample treated with vehicle for 8 days (T8-Vehicle). The aim is to identify genes whose knockout increases the cancer cells sensitivity to the drug. We will use FASTQ files containing 1% of reads from the original samples to demonstrate the read processing steps.</p>

<h2 id="raw-reads-qc">Raw reads QC</h2>

<p>First we’ll check the quality of the raw read sequences with <a href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">FastQC</a> and aggregate the reports from the multiple samples with <a href="https://multiqc.info/">MultiQC</a> (<span class="citation"><a href="#ewels2016multiqc">Ewels <i>et al.</i> 2016</a></span>). We will check if the base quality is good and for presence of adapters. For more details on quality control and what the other FastQC plots mean see the <a href="/training-material/topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.html">“Quality control” tutorial</a>.
With CRISPR screens we expect adapter sequence to be present, surrounding the guide. The adapters for the Brunello library vector used with this dataset (<a href="https://www.addgene.org/52963/">lentiGuide-Puro</a>) are shown below. We’ll get FASTQC to check for their presence by providing an adapters file with their sequences.</p>

  <p>The adapters file (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">adapter_list.tsv</code>) we use here with FASTQC was created by adding the two CRISPR adapter sequences (5’ and 3’ of the guide) to the bottom of <a href="https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC/blob/master/Configuration/adapter_list.txt">the adapters file used by FASTQC</a>. The first 12 bases of the CRISPR adapters were used, as that length is currently recommended in the FASTQC adapters file.</p>

This is shown on the left side of the figure. It is hard to trace which datasets contain “plus” data versus “minus” data. For example, does dataset 10 contain “plus” data or “minus” data? Probably “minus” but are you sure? In the case of a small history like the one shown here, it is possible to trace this manually but as the size of a history grows it will become very challenging.</p>   <p>The right side of the figure shows exactly the same analysis, but using name tags. When the analysis was conducted datasets 4 and 5 were tagged with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#plus</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#minus</code>, respectively. When they were used as inputs to Macs2 resulting datasets 6 and 8 automatically inherited them and so on… As a result it is straightforward to trace both branches (plus and minus) of this analysis.</p>   <p>More information is in a <a href="/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/name-tags/tutorial.html">dedicated #nametag tutorial</a>.</p>   <!-- Image is here = https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1iiNsau6ddiE2MV9qMyekUq2mrpDHHcc02bXtcFEAnhY/edit?usp=sharing --> </blockquote>

              <p>Yes. In the Adapter Content plot (below) we can see the two CRISPR adapters have been detected. The adapter 5 prime of the sgRNA starts appearing at the beginning of the reads and has been detected in nearly 100% of reads. The adapter 3 prime of the sgRNA appears after base 40. There’s also a little Illumina Universal adapter detected towards the ends of some reads which indicate the presence of short fragments, possibly adapter dimers.</p>

<h2 id="trim-adapters">Trim adapters</h2>

<p>We’ll trim the adapters from these sequences using <a href="https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html">Cutadapt</a> (<span class="citation"><a href="#marcel2011cutadapt">Marcel 2011</a></span>). To trim, we’ll use the 5’ adapter sequence. We don’t need to trim the 3’ adapter as Model-based Analysis of Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 Knockout (MAGeCK) will only use the first 20bp from each read. It determines the number of bases to use automatically from the length of the sequences in the library file, in our case 20bp, or we can specify the sgRNA length.</p>

  <p>In this dataset the adapters start at different positions in the reads, as was shown above. MAGeCK count can trim adapters around the guide sequences. However, the adapters need to start at the same position in each read, requiring the same trimming length, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mageck/wiki/advanced_tutorial/">as described on the MAGeCK website</a>. An example for what MAGeCK expects is shown below. If you used MAGeCK count trimming with the dataset in this tutorial it wouldn’t be able to trim the 5’ adapter properly and you would only get ~60% reads mapping instead of &gt;80%.</p>

<p>MultiQC produces a 5’ trimmed sequences plot where we can check the results are as expected. Here we can see the length of sequence trimmed from the start of the read ranges from 22bp to 30bp with a dip at 27bp. This corresponds to the length of the adapter (22bp) plus stagger sequence (0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8bp) (<a href="https://media.addgene.org/cms/filer_public/61/16/611619f4-0926-4a07-b5c7-e286a8ecf7f5/broadgpp-sequencing-protocol.pdf">see sequencing protocol</a>). There is no 5bp stagger sequence so 27bp sequences are not expected to be trimmed. The trimmed sequence lengths are what we expect for this dataset and the plot looks similar for all our samples which is good.</p>

<p>For the rest of the <abbr title="Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats">CRISPR</abbr> screen analysis, counting and testing, we’ll use the tool called <abbr title="Model-based Analysis of Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 Knockout">MAGeCK</abbr> (<span class="citation"><a href="#Li2014">Li <i>et al.</i> 2014</a></span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#Li2015">Li <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>).</p>

<p>To count how many guides we have for each gene, we need a library file that tells us which guide sequence belongs to which gene. The guides used here are from the <a href="https://www.addgene.org/pooled-library/broadgpp-human-knockout-brunello/">Brunello library</a> (<span class="citation"><a href="#Doench2016">Doench <i>et al.</i> 2016</a></span>) which contains 77,441 sgRNAs, an average of 4 sgRNAs per gene, and 1000 non-targeting control sgRNAs. <strong>The library file must be tab-separated and contain no spaces within the gene or target names</strong>. If necessary, there are tools in Galaxy that can format the file removing spaces and converting commas to tabs.</p>

  <p>Gini index is a measure of inequality from economics. It is used in CRISPR analysis to assess if sgRNAs are present in equal amounts. In positive selection experiments, where only some sgRNAs dominate, the index can be high. However, as discussed in <span class="citation"><a href="#Li2015">Li <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>, in plasmid library, in early time points, or negative selection experiments, we expect fairly even
distribution of the remaining sgRNAs that haven’t been negatively selected. A high Gini index in these types of sample can indicate CRISPR oligonucleotide synthesis unevenness, low viral transfection efficiency, and overselection, respectively.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The number of reads is ok. For example, for T0 control sample we have 17,272,052 reads mapped to guides. We have 77,441 guides so we have ~220 reads per guide (17,272,052/77,441). A minimum of 100 reads per guide, preferably 300, is recommended.</li>
      <li>Yes, in the summary we have &gt;85% mapped for all 3 samples. <abbr title="Model-based Analysis of Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 Knockout">MAGeCK</abbr> count does not allow any base mismatches between the reads and the library file, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mageck/wiki/advanced_tutorial/#tutorial-1-allow-mismatches-for-read-mapping">as described</a> so we expect not all reads will map. Note that we filtered out (6-10%) reads with Cutadapt so we should include those in our unmapped % if we want an accurate count.</li>
      <li>T0-Control has 0.71% (546/77441 * 100) sgRNAs that have no reads mapped, which is good. The T8 samples are just slightly high at 2.3% (1752/77441 * 100) and 2.8% (2170/77441 * 100).</li>
      <li>The Gini Index is 0.09 for T0-Control (initial state) which is good. The T8 samples are higher at 0.13 and 0.14 but good for a negative selection experiment.</li>

      <p>In the boxplots, we can see we have largely similiar distributions of counts for the 3 samples. The greater length of the box and between whiskers in the T8 samples compared to the control tells us we have a bit more variability of counts in those samples, more guides with low and high counts in T8 compared to the T0.

      <p>The Distribution of read counts plot shows us how many guides we have for each count (the frequency sums to the total no. of guides 77,441). Similar to the boxplots, the wider distribution for T8 compared to T0 shows us that those samples have more guides with low and high counts. The peak for T0 appears lower just because it has more points (bins) in the plot.

      <p>The PCA plot shows us the samples from the different conditions separate well. The T8 samples are a bit more similar to each other, to each other on PC1 axis than to T0. If we had more samples we could use this plot to check for clustering of replicates, batch effect or outliers.

<p>The paper by <span class="citation"><a href="#Li2015">Li <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span> has more information on MAGeCK quality control.</p>

<h1 id="testing">Testing</h1>

<p>Now that we’ve generated our guide counts, we’ll use MAGeCK test to identify essential genes. Essential means positively or negatively selected sgRNAs and genes. CRISPR positive or negative selection screens can be performed. With a positive selection screen, most cells die after the treatment (selection) and we are interested in identifying genes whose sgRNAs increase and dominate, indicating loss of those genes helps cells survive that treatment. This can help identify genes essential for drug resistance. With a negative selection screen, most cells survive after the treatment. In that case, we are interested in identifying genes whose sgRNAs decrease (drop out) compared to a control (e.g. vehicle), indicating those genes are needed for the cells to survive with that treatment. This can help identify genes essential for drug sensitivity. Regardless of the type of screen performed (positive or negative), MAGeCK can identify both positively and negatively selected genes in the screen (<span class="citation"><a href="#Li2014">Li <i>et al.</i> 2014</a></span>). The dataset we are using in this tutorial is from a negative selection screen where the aim is to identify genes whose knockout increases the cancer cells sensitivity to the drug.</p>

<h2 id="two-conditions">Two conditions</h2>

<p>If we want to compare the drug treatment (T8-APR-246) to the vehicle control (T8-Vehicle) we can use MAGeCK test. MAGeCK test uses a robust ranking aggregation (RRA) algorithm (<span class="citation"><a href="#Li2014">Li <i>et al.</i> 2014</a></span>).</p>

Raw read counts corresponding to single-guided RNAs (sgRNAs) from different experiments are first normalized using median normalization and mean-variance modeling is used to capture the relationship of mean and variance in replicates. The statistical significance of each sgRNA is calculated using the learned mean-variance model. Essential genes (both positively and negatively selected) are then identified by looking for genes whose sgRNAs are ranked consistently higher (by significance) using robust rank aggregation (RRA) (from <span class="citation"><a href="#Li2014">Li <i>et al.</i> 2014</a></span>)</figcaption></figure>

  <p>We are using MAGeCK’s default normalization method “median” which is more robust to outliers.
Figure M1 from <span class="citation"><a href="#Li2014">Li <i>et al.</i> 2014</a></span> shows a comparison of median (“median”) versus total (“total”) normalization for two CRISPR screen datasets.
The distribution of the read counts of significant sgRNAs (FDR=1%) was compared with the mean read count distribution of all sgRNAs (“all”, black). The distribution of the significant sgRNAs should be similar to the distribution of all sgRNAs if the normalization method is unbiased. The difference is small for the leukemia dataset. However, in the melanoma dataset, where a few sgRNAs have very large read counts, the difference is larger, as “total” normalization will prefer sgRNAs with higher read-counts. In contrast, the distribution after “median” normalization is closer to the distribution of all sgRNAs.</p>

  <p><a href="../../images/crispr-screen/median_vs_total.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/crispr-screen/median_vs_total.png" alt="Median versus Total normalization. " width="1372" height="764" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

  <p>If many genes have zero counts, such as after treatment in a positive selection screen, the median may be zero and we may get a message in the MAGeCK log that we have to use total normalization.</p>

  <p>Instead of median or total, we could choose to normalize using control guide sgRNAs. However, we would need to know that they’re not changing due to the experiment or introducing bias (<span class="citation"><a href="#Chen2018">Chen <i>et al.</i> 2018</a></span>).</p>

<p>The PDF also shows plots with the sgRNA counts for the top 10 genes. These values are the normalized counts for each sgRNA from the sgRNA summary file. With these plots we can see if the counts of all the sgRNAs for these top genes are changing similarly.</p>

      <li>No. We can see in this case that, while one sgRNA is a lot lower in the APR treated sample compared to the vehicle, one increases a little, and the other two sgRNAs don’t change much. So we might conclude that this gene is not strongly negatively selected.</li>
      <li>None. One reason for this is likely the large number of genes being tested (&gt;20,000).

<h3 id="visualisation">Visualisation</h3>

<p>In addition to the visualisations automatically generated by MAGeCK in the PDF, we can create a volcano plot to further visualise the output. With a volcano plot we plot the magnitude of change for drug treatment versus vehicle control (lfc) versus significance (p-value). As we have two columns for lfc and p-value, one for negative selection and one for positive, we first combine these into one column for each using the <strong>awk</strong> tool. If the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">neg|p-value</code> is smaller than the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pos|p-value</code> the gene is negatively selected. If the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">neg|p-value</code> is larger than the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pos|p-value</code> the gene is positively selected. Then we create the plot using the <strong>Volcano plot</strong> tool.</p>

<h3 id="pathway-analysis">Pathway analysis</h3>

<p>We can perform pathway analysis on the results to identify pathways that are changing with the treatment. MAGeCK has a pathway analysis module, however, we will use the tool <strong>fgsea</strong> as it outputs some visualisations and the genes enriched in the pathway. For fgsea we need a ranked list of genes and a pathways file in GMT format. We can get the ranked list from our mageck results, we’ll use the RRA score column for negative results. For the pathways, we’ll use the Hallmark pathways from MSigDB, which can be a <a href="http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/collection_details.jsp">good starting point for pathway exploration</a>.</p>

<h2 id="optional-multiple-conditions">(Optional) Multiple conditions</h2>

<p><em>It takes about 30 mins to run mageck mle on the samples below so this part of the tutorial is optional, you can try it if time allows or in your own time.</em></p>

<p>If we have more than two conditions to compare, or a complex experimental design, we can use MAGeCK mle. MAGeCK mle uses a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm (<span class="citation"><a href="#Li2015">Li <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>). It outputs a single value (beta score) per gene instead of a score for both negative and positive selection. A negative beta score indicates negative selection and a positive indicates positive selection. MAGeCK mle can also be used for comparing 2 conditions instead of MAGeCK test (RRA) but it is slower.</p>

<p>To demonstrate using MAGeCK mle, we will compare the drug treatment (T8-APR-246) to T0 and the vehicle (T8-Vehicle) to T0.
We’ll use <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mageck/wiki/input/#design-matrix-file">a design matrix file</a>.
The rules of the design matrix are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The design matrix file must include a header line of condition labels</li>
  <li>The first column is the sample labels that must match labels in read count file</li>
  <li>The second column must be a “baseline” column that sets all values to “1”</li>
  <li>The value in the design matrix is either “0” or “1”</li>
  <li>You must have at least one sample of “initial state” (e.g., day 0 or plasmid) that has only one “1” in the corresponding row. That only “1” must be in the baseline column</li>
  <li>The initial state (baseline) sample must be the 1st sample listed, under the header row, for mageck mle</li>
</ul>

<p>The file for our samples looks like below. We have 3 conditions: baseline (T0), Vehicle and APR. The 1st row indicates that T0 is our baseline sample, the 2nd row indicates that we want to compare Vehicle to T0, and the 3rd row indicates that we want to compare APR to T0.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Samples     baseline  Vehicle APR
T0-Control  1         0       0
T8-Vehicle  1         1       0
T8-APR-246  1         0       1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Examples of more complicated design matrices, for e.g. time series experiments, can be seen on the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mageck/wiki/advanced_tutorial/#tutorial-4-make-full-use-of-mageck-mle-for-more-complicated-experimental-design-eg-paired-samples-time-series">MAGeCK website</a>.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p><abbr title="Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats">CRISPR</abbr> Screen reads can be assessed for quality using standard sequencing tools such as FASTQC, MultiQC and trimmed of adapters using Cutadapt. The detection of enriched guides can be performed using <abbr title="Model-based Analysis of Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 Knockout">MAGeCK</abbr>. Downstream analysis can include visualisations, such as volcano plot, and pathway analysis with tools like fgsea.</p>

					<b>Liked</b>: A demo with a cripsr pool set who works (so many online pool screen CRIPSR tools do not work). so many command based installation do not work.  Simply starting with MAGECK installation on python is just a nightmare, it does not install smoothly, and it seems thatthe original authors move on and do not care at deploying this smoothly to the community(only expert can use these code lines). I really appreciate the work here. It seems more applicable from any machine without all the dependancies, environments, expertise in coding  and languages bug...... 
					<b>Disliked</b>: Should make mageck available in  global galaxy and not just australia one. Could provide other datasets such as cripsrI or cripsA pool set to extend the range of trial for users to get accustomed with the pipeline.

					<b>Liked</b>: It was super clear, and combine nice tools
					<b>Disliked</b>: For me was not "intuitive" to have a test with two p-values (for negative/positive selection). That I do not know if it is pretty common in transcriptomic (and I missed it) or if it is non so commonly used and it was speciffically developed on MAGeCK test. If it is not commonly use I think that can be nice to include a brief description of the statistical test in the tutorial of the course.
