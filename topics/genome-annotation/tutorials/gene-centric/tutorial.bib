  abstract  = "Coding of multiple proteins by overlapping reading frames is not
               a feature one would associate with eukaryotic genes. Indeed,
               codependency between codons of overlapping protein-coding
               regions imposes a unique set of evolutionary constraints, making
               it a costly arrangement. Yet in cases of tightly coexpressed
               interacting proteins, dual coding may be advantageous. Here we
               show that although dual coding is nearly impossible by chance, a
               number of human transcripts contain overlapping coding regions.
               Using newly developed statistical techniques, we identified 40
               candidate genes with evolutionarily conserved overlapping coding
               regions. Because our approach is conservative, we expect mammals
               to possess more dual-coding genes. Our results emphasize that
               the skepticism surrounding eukaryotic dual coding is
               unwarranted: rather than being artifacts, overlapping reading
               frames are often hallmarks of fascinating biology.",

  abstract = "Eukaryotic genes with overlapping reading frames exemplify some
              of the most striking biological phenomena. Transcript of one such
              gene, the gene encoding X-box protein (XBP1), has evolved a
              mechanism for 'on-demand' switching of translation between two
              overlapping reading frames. Despite the existence of this
              elaborate system, only one reading frame was believed to be
              functional. Here, we show that XBP1 evolves in a fashion that is
              only consistent with functionality of both reading frames. Our
              study provides a novel evolutionary framework for the analysis of
              loci with overlapping reading frames, which can be used for
              identification and analyses of novel dual-coding genes. ?? 2006

  abstract = "Protein handling, modification and folding in the endoplasmic
              reticulum (ER) are tightly regulated processes that determine
              cell function, fate and survival. In several tumour types,
              diverse oncogenic, transcriptional and metabolic abnormalities
              cooperate to generate hostile microenvironments that disrupt ER
              homeostasis in malignant and stromal cells, as well as
              infiltrating leukocytes. These changes provoke a state of
              persistent ER stress that has been demonstrated to govern
              multiple pro-tumoural attributes in the cancer cell while
              dynamically reprogramming the function of innate and adaptive
              immune cells. Aberrant activation of ER stress sensors and their
              downstream signalling pathways have therefore emerged as key
              regulators of tumour growth and metastasis as well as response to
              chemotherapy, targeted therapies and immunotherapy. In this
              Review, we discuss the physiological inducers of ER stress in the
              tumour milieu, the interplay between oncogenic signalling and ER
              stress response pathways in the cancer cell and the profound

  abstract = "High-quality and complete reference genome assemblies are
              fundamental for the application of genomics to biology, disease,
              and biodiversity conservation. However, such assemblies are
              available for only a few non-microbial species1-4. To address
              this issue, the international Genome 10K (G10K) consortium5,6 has
              worked over a five-year period to evaluate and develop
              cost-effective methods for assembling highly accurate and nearly
              complete reference genomes. Here we present lessons learned from
              generating assemblies for 16 species that represent six major
              vertebrate lineages. We confirm that long-read sequencing
              technologies are essential for maximizing genome quality, and
              that unresolved complex repeats and haplotype heterozygosity are
              major sources of assembly error when not handled correctly. Our
              assemblies correct substantial errors, add missing sequence in
              some of the best historical reference genomes, and reveal
              biological discoveries. These include the identification of many
              false gene duplications, increases in gene sizes, chromosome
              rearrangements that are specific to lineages, a repeated
              independent chromosome breakpoint in bat genomes, and a canonical
              GC-rich pattern in protein-coding genes and their regulatory
              regions. Adopting these lessons, we have embarked on the
              Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP), an international effort to
              generate high-quality, complete reference genomes for all of the
              roughly 70,000 extant vertebrate species and to help to enable a
              new era of discovery across the life sciences.",
