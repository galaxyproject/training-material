                <p>Sequence comparison is a core problem in bioinformatics. It is used widely in evolutionary studies, structural and functional analyses, assembly, metagenomics, etc. Despite its regular presence in everyday Life-sciences pipelines, it is still not a trivial step that can be overlooked. Therefore, understanding how sequence comparison works is key to developing efficient workflows that are central to so many other disciplines.</p>

<p>In the following tutorial, we will learn how to compare both small and large sequences using both seed-based alignment methods and alignment-free methods, and how to post-process our comparisons to refine our results. Besides, we will also learn about the theoretical background of sequence comparison, including why some tools are suitable for some jobs and others are not.</p>

<p>This tutorial is divided into two large sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fine-grained sequence comparison: In this part of the tutorial we will use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GECKO</code> (<span class="citation"><a href="#GECKO">Torreno and Trelles 2015</a></span>) to perform sequence alignment between small sequences. We will also identify, extract and re-align regions of interest.</li>
  <li>Coarse-grained sequence comparison: In this part of the tutorial, we will tackle on how to compare massive sequences using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CHROMEISTER</code> (<span class="citation"><a href="#perez2019ultra">Pérez-Wohlfeil <i>et al.</i> 2019</a></span>), an alignment-free sequence comparison tool. We will generate visualization plots for the comparison of large plant genomes and automatically detect large-scale rearrangements.</li>

<p>Imagine you are working on an evolutionary study regarding the species <em>Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae</em>. In particular, you are interested in the strains <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">232</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7422</code> and wish to compare their DNA sequence to know more about the evolutionary changes that took place between both. The workflow you will follow starts with (1) acquiring the data, (2)  getting it ready for Galaxy, (3) running the comparison and (4) inspecting and working with the resulting alignments. Let’s go!</p>

<h2 id="preparing-the-data">Preparing the data</h2>

<p>First we will be uploading the data to Galaxy so that we can run our tools on it.</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">

    <ol>
      <li>It always depends on the focus of our study. For instance, if we were looking for optimal alignments, two 1 MB sequences are indeed large enough to make most approaches either fail or take a decent amount of time and resources. On the other hand, if we were looking for seed-based local alignments (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GECKO</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BLAST</code> (<span class="citation"><a href="#BLAST">Altschul <i>et al.</i> 1990</a></span>) ), the comparison would require merely seconds (check the slides for more information).</li>
    </ol>

  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>As we discussed in the previous section, running optimal aligning tools on such “small” data can be difficult (in fact, tools such as the well-known <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EMBOSS needle</code> will require cuadratic amounts of time and memory, whereas tools such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EMBOSS strecher</code> will require quadratic time (<span class="citation"><a href="#myers1988optimal">Myers and Miller 1988</a></span>)). These limitations can make it impractical in many situations. Therefore, we will now learn how to overcome these limitations by employing seed-based methods, particularly <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GECKO</code>.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Besides the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minimum length</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minimum similarity</code> parameters, which are applied as a filter after the comparison is completed, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k-mer seed size</code> is an internal parameter that regulates the number of seeds that can be found. A smaller <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k-mer</code> size will translate into detecting more seeds, which are starting points for alignments.</li>
          <li>Notice that this parameter must be taken into account depending on the type of sequence that we are working with. For example, if we set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k-mer seed size</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">32</code>, then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GECKO</code> will attempt to find alignments that start with 32 consecutive, equally aligned base pairs between the two sequences. If your sequences are far away from each other (in terms of evolutionary distance) then it will be very hard to find such 32 consecutive base pairs!</li>
          <li>Some advice: this parameter can affect performance greatly. For instance, setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k-mer seed size</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8</code> in the case of chromosomes can require much more computing time than using for instance <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">32</code>. On the other hand, if we set it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">32</code> in the case of small bacterial sequences, we might not find any alignments!</li>

  <p>In a different scenario where e.g. you do not know what to look for or need to find the location of particular alignments, and you need an interactive exploration, you can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GECKO-MGV</code> to ease the process. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GECKO-MGV</code>generates a visual representation where you can zoom in and out of the alignments, select and export as FASTA, etc., find more in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GECKO-MGV</code> article (<span class="citation"><a href="#diaz2019combining">Diaz-del-Pino <i>et al.</i> 2019</a></span>) or run it with a dockerized container, as described in the <a href="https://github.com/estebanpw/docker-geckomgv">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>For our current experiment, we will be looking for the following set of repeats:</p>

(Right) Zoomed-in region where the repeats of interest are located.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Let’s extract the repeats highlighted in red (Figure 1, right) which are aligned to the position 19,610 in the query sequence and perform a multiple sequence alignment on them to check if there are any evolutionary differences. The sequences will be extracted from the reference (i.e. <em>Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae 7422</em>) since this is where the repeats duplicate in respect to the query sequence (notice that in Figure 1 we are selecting the ones stacked vertically).</p>

<p>We can see that there are several locus along the duplicated repeats where single point mutations have taken place, and that the ending of the last repeat is missing.</p>

<p>So far we have learnt how to run our own custom sequence comparison, extract a set of DNA repeats and perform multiple sequence alignment on them (MSA). While this represents an common example of a bioinformatics pipeline, in the next part of the tutorial we will jump to a large-scale comparison scenario where we do not need fine-grained alignments, but instead we will be looking at the “bigger picture” using alignment-free methods.</p>

<h1 id="coarse-grained-sequence-comparison">Coarse-grained sequence comparison</h1>

<p>In this second part of the tutorial, we are going to work with chromosome-sized sequences. While we can still use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GECKO</code> for chromosomes, it will take some more time and resources. However, consider now the case where you do not need alignments, but rather are in one of the following cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are working with a very large <em>de novo</em> assembly genome for which you do not know the strain and thus you need to compare it to several candidates.</li>
  <li>You want to study large evolutionary rearrangements at a block level rather than alignment level at several species at once.</li>
  <li>You want to generate a dotplot between several massive chromosomes from e.g. plants to find the main syntenies, but your sequences are full of repeats and other computational approaches fail.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can imagine, all three scenarios require several large-scale sequence comparisons. While there are also other ways to approach these situations, in this tutorial we will learn how we can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CHROMEISTER</code> which is specifically designed for large-scale genome comparison without alignments (alignment-free method).</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Before jumping on the hands-on, let us see an example of the second case: say we wanted to study the evolutionary rearrangements between the grass and common wheat genomes (<em>Aegilops tauschii</em> and <em>Triticum aestivum</em>). The following plot shows the comparison:</p>

<figure id="figure-2" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/hpc-for-lsgc/Chrom07.png" alt="Large-scale genome comparison example. " width="995" height="936" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/hpc-for-lsgc/Chrom07.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 2</strong>:</span> Chromosome comparison for <em>Aegilops tauschii</em> and <em>Triticum aestivum</em>. Since both genomes have seven chromosomes, we would require seven times seven comparisons, i.e. 49 chromosome comparisons with each sequence being over 500 MBs in size!</figcaption></figure>

<p>Now there are some things to note here: (1) these alignment-free comparisons can be performed very quickly, (2) we can visually see the large rearrangements and (3) we can identify which chromosome comparisons actually have any signal. This last point is interesting because it allows us to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CHROMEISTER</code> to quickly identify which comparisons are worth to perform with more accurate tools and avoid lots of unnecessary computation (in this case only the diagonal has similarity, but it might not be the case, <em>e.g.</em> <em>Homo sapiens</em> and <em>Mus musculus</em>).</p>

<p>Let us now jump into the hands-on! We will learn how to compare chromosomes with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CHROMEISTER</code>, particularly from the grass and common wheat genomes, which are nearly 5 times larger than the average human chromosome!</p>

      <li>Chromosome-like sequences are arguably some of the largest DNA sequences you can find. Regarding the comparison, optimal chromosome comparison typically requires either large clusters to be run or special hardware accelerators (such as GPUs). On the other hand, for seed-based local alignment we can still use common approaches, but they will take a considerable amount of time. Finally, if we use alignment-free methods such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CHROMEISTER</code>, we can perform a comparison in few minutes (check the slides for more information) instead of hours.</li>

        <p>Some of the parameters used in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CHROMEISTER</code> are similar to those in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GECKO</code>, but others are new, in particular:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><em>“Output dotplot size”</em>: This number represents the width and height of the resulting comparison plot, but it also affects the degree of precision with which alignment-free blocks are calculated. A value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1000</code> is adequate for mostly everything (resulting in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1000x1000</code> output doplot), but for extremely large sequences a value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2000</code> will yield more resolution since less blocks will be grouped together.</li>
          <li><em>“K-mer seed size”</em>: This value is the same as in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GECKO</code>. Generally, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">32</code> is a good choice for any sequence that is not very small such as the mycoplasmas from the previous part of the tutorial, which were around 1 Mbp in size.</li>
          <li><em>“Diffuse value”</em>: This parameter regulates the stringency with which alignment-free seeds are matched. A diffuse value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> means perfect matching, whereas a value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4</code> means match only a fourth of the seed (taken in uniform steps). The value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4</code> is recommended for everything except when signals start to deteriorate in large comparisons with plenty of repeats.</li>
          <li>The <em>“Add grid to plot for multi-fasta data sets”</em> parameter adds grid lines to the plot to separate multiple sequences. This is useful when using multi-fasta inputs.</li>
          <li>The <em>“Generate image of detected events”</em> parameter will include, if enabled, a plot of the rearrangements detected with colors, one per type of rearrangement. More on that later!</li>

<p>Your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Comparison dotplot</code> file (remember to inspect each using the <i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">galaxy-eye</span> icon) should look like this:</p>

<figure id="figure-3" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/hpc-for-lsgc/aegilops-triticum.png" alt="Single chromosome comparison. " width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/hpc-for-lsgc/aegilops-triticum.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 3</strong>:</span> Chromosome comparison corresponding to <em>Aegilops tauschii</em> and <em>Triticum aestivum</em> as generated with CHROMEISTER. Each axis corresponds to one sequence, from origin to end.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Figure 3 shows the comparison plot for the plant chromosomes. Notice that the origin of both sequences is at the top-left and the ending is at the bottom-right of the plot. Noise and small repeats are filtered out automatically by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CHROMEISTER</code> to allow focusing on where the main similarity blocks are located. We can see that there three types of blocks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blocks that are “conserved” are on the main diagonal. This means that the sequences are similar (in a coarse-grained fashion) in such regions.</li>
  <li>Blocks that are inverted are on the antidiagonals, i.e. rotated 90 degrees. These blocks show sequence regions that have been reversed and rearranged into the complementary strand.</li>
  <li>Blocks that are not in the main diagonal are “transposed”, meaning that they have been rearranged in one of the sequences but not in the other. These can also be inverted.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="comment">
  <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-note-on-the-comparison-plot"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment: Note on the comparison plot</div>
  <p>Notice that the comparison plot is only an approximation. It is aimed at showing the general location and direction of syntenies. For example, if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CHROMEISTER</code> was run with parameter <strong>Output dotplot size</strong> equal to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1000</code>, then each pixel in the plot contains the averaged information of nearly 500,000 base pairs! Thus, any block can contain lots of smaller rearrangements, mutations, inversions, etc., that are ignored for the sake of providing a clean overview of the general alignment direction in a pairwise comparison.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also note that a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">score</code> value can be seen in the title of the plot (this value is also available in the <strong>Comparison score</strong> file). This value is calculated based on the alignment coverage and number of rearrangements and can be used to automatically filter out similar from dissimilar sequence comparisons. A value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> means that the sequences are nearly equal (rearrangement-wise), whereas a value closer to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> means that the sequences are more dissimilar.</p>

<h2 id="post-processing-detecting-rearrangements">Post-processing: detecting rearrangements</h2>

<p>Let us now see how the blocks detected in the comparison are automatically classified for further processing. Figure 4 shows the blocks detected heuristically from the comparison and classified according to their position and orientation. This plot is available in the file <strong>Detected events plot</strong>.</p>

<figure id="figure-4" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/hpc-for-lsgc/aegilops-triticum-events.png" alt="Events in chromosome comparison.

<p>In Figure 4 we can see a similar plot to that in Figure 3 but with the addition of colors. Each detected block is labelled according to whether it is in the main diagonal (red), transposed (blue) or inverted (green). Inverted transpositions are also labelled green. Notice that this automatic classification process is based on the Hough transform (<span class="citation"><a href="#duda1972use">Duda and Hart 1972</a></span>) which is governed by a set of parameters which can therefore affect the sensitivity of the detection of blocks, and hence some blocks can be missed.</p>

<p>Each of these blocks is also available in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CSV</code> file <strong>Detected events</strong>. Let us take a peek:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>xStart,yStart,xEnd,yEnd,strand,approximate length,description

<p>The header line describes each column. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xStart</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xEnd</code> are the starting and ending coordinates in the query sequence, wheras <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yStart</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yEnd</code> are the same but for the reference sequence. The strand can be either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f</code> for the forward strand or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r</code> for the reverse strand. Notice that the length of the block is approximate, since it is an estimation based on the length of the line and transformed by the length of each sequence. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">description</code> column contains the label of the detected event. The four possible types (conserved block, inversion, transposition or inverted transposition) are shown above with examples.</p>

<p>Besides providing a visual understanding of the large rearrangements that took place between two sequences, the detection of blocks can be further used to research evolutionary distances, for instance by incorporating the number of Large Scale Genome Rearrangements to generate richer metrics in phylogenetic studies.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>From a pratical perspective, we have shown how to run pairwise genome comparisons using Galaxy, from small to large-scale sequences (in particular bacterial mycoplasmas and plant chromosomes) throughout two levels of precision:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GECKO</code> to detect High-scoring Segment Pairs, which can be used to find fine-grained alignments such as repeats, genes, synteny blocks, etc.</li>
  <li>Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CHROMEISTER</code> to find large-scale conserved blocks, which enables us to look at the “big picture” of a comparison as well as study its large-scale rearrangements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, we have described how we can use additional tools to post-process our comparisons, including extraction of alignments, multiple sequence alignment, automatic detection of rearrangements, dotplot visualization, etc. Additionally, we recommend taking a look at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GECKO-MGV</code> (<span class="citation"><a href="#diaz2019combining">Diaz-del-Pino <i>et al.</i> 2019</a></span>), a tool for the interactive exploration of sequence comparisons produced with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GECKO</code>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, from a theoretical standpoint, we have discussed why sequence comparison is a difficult problem, how the length of the sequences can affect runtimes, the complexity of the algorithms, impact of parameters, etc., in order to give researchers a broader understanding of how to use sequence comparison algorithms for their scientific experiments (more details in the slides).</p>
