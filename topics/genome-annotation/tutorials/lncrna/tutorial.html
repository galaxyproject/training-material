                <p>Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are not the only type of RNAs present in organisms (like mammals, insects or plants) and represent only a small fraction of the transcripts. A vast repertoire of small (miRNAs, snRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are also present. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) are generally defined as transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that are not translated into functional proteins. They are important because of their major roles in cellular machinery and their presence in large number. Indeed, they are notably involved in gene expression regulation, control of translation or imprinting. Statistics from the <a href="https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/stats_41.html">GENCODE project</a> reveals that the human genome contains more than 19,095 lncRNA genes, almost as much as the 19,370 protein-coding genes.</p>

<p>Using RNASeq data, we can reconstruct assembled transcripts (with ou without any reference genome) which can then be annotated and identified individually as <abbr title="Messenger RNAs">mRNAs</abbr> or <abbr title="long non-coding RNAs">lncRNAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will use a software tool called <em>StringTie</em> (<span class="citation"><a href="#Pertea">“<b>StringTie enables improved reconstruction of a transcriptome from RNA-seq reads</b>” 2015</a></span>) to assemble the transcripts and then <em>FEELnc</em> (<span class="citation"><a href="#Wucher">“<b>FEELnc: a tool for long non-coding RNA annotation and its application to the dog transcriptome</b>” 2017</a></span>) to annotate the assembled transcripts of a small eukaryote: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucor_mucedo"><em>Mucor mucedo</em></a> (a fungal plant pathogen).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gpertea/stringtie"><em>StringTie</em></a> is a fast and highly efficient assembler of RNA-Seq alignments into potential transcripts.</p>

  <li>FEELnc_filter: Extract, filter candidate transcripts.</li>
  <li>FEELnc_codpot: Compute the coding potential of candidate transcripts.</li>

<p>To assemble transcriptome with StringTie and annotate <abbr title="long non-coding RNAs">lncRNAs</abbr> with FEELnc, we will use the following files :</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>genome sequence</strong> in fasta format. For this tutorial, we will use the genome assembled in the <a href="/training-material/topics/assembly/tutorials/flye-assembly/tutorial.html">Flye assembly tutorial</a>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>genome annotation</strong> in GFF3 format. We will use the genome annotation obtained in the <a href="/training-material/topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/funannotate/tutorial.html">Funannotate tutorial</a>.</li>
  <li>Some aligned <strong>RNASeq data</strong> in bam format. Here, we will use some mapped RNASeq data where mapping was done using STAR.</li>

<h1 id="transcripts-assembly-with-stringtie">Transcripts assembly with StringTie</h1>

<p>StringTie is a fast and highly efficient assembler of RNA-Seq alignments into potential transcripts.
StringTie takes as input a SAM, BAM or CRAM file sorted by coordinate (genomic location). This file should contain spliced RNA-seq read alignments such as the ones produced by TopHat, HISAT2 or STAR. The TopHat output is already sorted, but the SAM ouput from other aligners should be sorted using the samtools program.</p>

<p>A reference annotation file in GTF or GFF3 format can be provided to StringTie which can be used as ‘guides’ for the assembly process and help improve the transcript structure recovery for those transcripts.</p>

<p>We obtain an annotation file (GTF format) which contained all assembled transcripts present in the RNASeq data.</p>

<h1 id="lncrnas-annotation-with-feelnc">lncRNAs annotation with FEELnc</h1>

<p>FEELnc is a pipeline which is composed of 3 steps. These 3 steps are run automatically when running FEELnc within Galaxy. The first step (FEELnc_filter) consists in filtering out unwanted/spurious transcripts and/or transcripts overlapping (in sense) exons of the reference annotation, and especially protein coding exons as they more probably correspond to new mRNA isoforms.</p>

<p>To use FEELnc, we need to have a reference annotation file in GTF format, which contains protein-coding genes annotation. Presently, we downloaded only the reference annotation file in GFF3 format (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">annotation.gff3</code>). To convert from GFF3 to GTF format, we will use <a href="https://github.com/gpertea/gffread"><em>gffread</em></a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>lncRNA annotation file: annotation file in GTF format which contains the final set of <abbr title="long non-coding RNAs">lncRNAs</abbr></li>
  <li>mRNA annotation file: annotation file in GTF format which contains the final set of <abbr title="Messenger RNAs">mRNAs</abbr></li>

<blockquote class="question">

    <p>The summary file indicates 268 <abbr title="long non-coding RNAs">lncRNAs</abbr> and 0 new <abbr title="Messenger RNAs">mRNAs</abbr> were annotated by FEELnc. The initial annotation contains 13,795 <abbr title="Messenger RNAs">mRNAs</abbr> annotated. Therefore, a total of 14,063 RNAs are currently annotated.</p>

    <p>The summary file indicates 772 interactions between <abbr title="long non-coding RNAs">lncRNAs</abbr> and <abbr title="Messenger RNAs">mRNAs</abbr>. These interactions are described in the Classifier output file.</p>

    <p>The different types of <abbr title="long non-coding RNAs">lncRNAs</abbr> (intergenic (sense and antisense), intragenic (sense)) are described in the Classifier output file.

<p>For future analyses, it would be interesting to use an updated annotation containing <abbr title="Messenger RNAs">mRNAs</abbr> and <abbr title="long non-coding RNAs">lncRNAs</abbr> annotations. Thus, we will merge the reference annotation with those obtained with FEELnc.</p>
