      Prokka is a "wrapper"; it collects together several pieces of software
      (from various authors), and so avoids “re-inventing the wheel”. Prokka
      finds and annotates features (both protein coding regions and RNA genes,
      i.e. tRNA, rRNA) present on on a sequence. Note, Prokka uses a two-step
      process for the annotation of protein coding regions: first, protein
      coding regions on the genome are identified using <a
      href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2848648/">Prodigal</a>;
      second, the function of the encoded protein is predicted by similarity to
      proteins in one of many protein or protein domain databases. Prokka is a
      software tool that can be used to annotate bacterial, archaeal and viral
      genomes quickly, generating standard output files in GenBank, EMBL and gff
      formats. More information about Prokka can be found <a
      href="https://github.com/tseemann/prokka">here</a>.

      Now that we have annotated the draft genome sequence, we would like to
      view the sequence in the JBrowse genome viewer. First, we have to make a
      JBrowse file. Then, we can view it within Galaxy.
