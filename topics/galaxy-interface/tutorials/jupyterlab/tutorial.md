# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

{% include topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/jupyterlab/tutorial_origin.md %}

[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable) is an [Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).
Like most IDEs, it provides a graphical interface for R/Python, making it more user-friendly, and providing dozens of useful features.
We will introduce additional benefits of using JupyterLab as you cover the lessons.

# JupyterLab

## Opening up JupyterLab

{% include snippets/launch_jupyterlab.md %}

You should now be looking at a page with the JupyterLab interface:

![Jupyterlab default session](../../images/jupyterlab_default_session.png)

As shown on the figure above, JupyterLab interface is made of 3 main areas:
- The menu barat the top
- The left side bar with in particular the **File Browser**
- The main work area in the central panel

## Start your first notebook

Now that we are ready to start exploring JupyterLab, we will want to keep a record of the commands we are using. To do this we can start a Notebook.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Start a notebook
>
> 1. On the left side bar, in the **File Browser**, double-click on the file called **ipython_galaxy_notebook.ipynb**. This will open the
> default notebook in the main work area.
> 2. If **ipython_galaxy_notebook.ipynb** does not exist (for instance on *Try JupyterLab*) then click on **+** (top left) to start **The launcher** and then **Python** icon in the **Notebook** section to create a new blank notebook.
{: .hands_on}

A new notebook appears in the centre panel. Before we go any further, you should learn to save your script.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Save a Python notebook
>
> 1. Click the **File** menu and select **Save Notebook As...
>    Alternatively, you can also:
>    - Click the {% icon galaxy-save %} icon (**Save the notebook contents and create checkpoint**) in the bar above the first line in the script editor
>    - Click the **File** menu and select **Save Notebook**
>    - Type <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> (<kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> on OSX)
>
> 2. In the **Save Notebook As** window that opens, name your file `ipython_galaxy_notebok`
>    Alternatively, you can also rename your Jupyter Notbook:
>    - Right click on the name (`Untitled.ipynb`) in the bar above the first line in the script editor and select **Rename Notebook**
{: .hands_on}

The new script `ipython_galaxy_notebook.ipynb` should appear in the **File Browser*** in the left panel. By convention, Jupyter notebooks end with the file extension `.ipynb` independently of the programming language (R, Python, Octave, Julia, etc.).

> ### {% icon comment %} Note: supported programming languages
>
> Depending on your JupyterLab instance, the list of supported programming languages may vary.
> On [Live.useGalaxy.eu](https://live.usegalaxy.eu), the following programming languages are currently supported:
> - Python 3
> - Julia
> - R
> - Octave
> - Ansible
> - Bash
> - SciJava
{: .comment}

By default, a **Python notebook** is started. Don't worry if you are not familiar with *Python* programming language, it is not necessary for this tutorial. The same functionalities applies for any available programming languages.

> ### {% icon comment %} Note: switching to another programming language
>
> Once you have created a Notebook, you can switch to another available programming language (**Switch kernel**).
> 1. On the top right of your running Notebook, click on **Python 3**. A new window pops up:
> ![jupyterlab switch kernel](../../images/jupyterlab_switch_kernel.png)
> 2. In this new window, click on **Python 3** to select an available programming language (R, octave, Julia, etc.).
> 3. Click on **Select** to activate your selection. The pop-up window closes and you are ready to use your notebook with the selected programming language.
>    Alternatively, you can also:
> 1. Click on **+** (top left menu) to start the **Launcher**. The list of available programming language is given in the **Notebook** section.
> 2. Click on icon of your choice in the **Notebook** section.
> 3. A new notebook is created with the programming language of your choice.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Import Python libraries
>
> 1. Click on a cell of your notebook to edit it (verify that it is defined as a `Code` cell)
> 2. Enter the following lines : `import numpy as np` and `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`.
> 3. `shift`+`return` to run the cell or click on the run cell button.

## Graph Display in JupyterLab with Python

In this tutorial we are going to simply plot a simple graph using generated data.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Draw a simple plot
>
> 1. Generate a simple dataset `x = np.linspace(0, 2, 100)` and `y = x**2`
> 2. Create your figure with the command `fig, ax = plt.subplots( nrows=1, ncols=1 ,figsize=(15, 10) )`
>   -  `nrows=1, ncols=1` means you will have one plot in your figure (one row and one column)
>   -  `figsize` parameter determine the size of the figure
> 3. Draw the plot with the command `plt.plot(x, y);` ![Simple plot in Jupyter](../../images/jupyterlab_plot.png)

# Interaction between JupyterLab and Galaxy

## Import / export Data

You can import data from Galaxy history using the `get(12)` command, with the number of your dataset in the history (If you are working on a collection, unhide datasets to see their numbers).

If you want to save a file you generated in your notebook, use the `put("file_name")` command. That is what we are going to do with our distribution plot.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Save an Jupyter generated image into a Galaxy History
>
> 1. Create an image file with the figure you just draw with the command `fig.savefig('simpleplot.png')`
> 2. Export your image into your history with the command  `put('simpleplot.png')`
>
{: .hands_on}


## Save the Notebook in your history

Once you are done with you analysis or anytime during the editing process, you can save the notebook into your history using the `put("ipython_galaxy_notebook.ipynb")`. If you create additional notebooks with different names, make sure you save them all before you quit JupyterLab.

This will create a new notebook `.pynb` file in your history every time you click on this icon.
