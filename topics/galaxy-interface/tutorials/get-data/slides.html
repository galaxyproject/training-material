# Getting data into Galaxy

???

-> Pressing **P** will toggle presenter mode.

---

## Many ways to get data into your workspace

1. Import using **Get Data** sources e.g. UCSC, SRA
2. Import from a Galaxy **Data Library**
3. Import using **Upload File**
  - Import from your computer
  - Directly enter text
  - Import from a URL
  - Import using FTP
  - Import directly into Collection
  - Import using Rule Builder

???

- To do analysis in Galaxy you first need data to work on.
- There are many ways and sources for getting data into your history.
- This tutorial will cover all of the techniques listed here.

---

### Best method depends on where the data is, and how big it is

.footnote[[Source: Galaxy Community Hub](https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/upload/)]

---

# 1. The ***Get Data*** toolbox section

---


- *Click* on the **Get Data** toolbox in the toolbox (the left panel)

![Click on Get Data to expand it](../../images/get_data_boxed.png)

---

.pull-right[.image-75[![A typical list of data sources](../../images/get_data_expanded.png)]]

- Expands to show data sources
  - E.g. UCSC, NCBI, Uniprot, ..
  - The specific data sources available on your Galaxy instance are determine by the server's administrator

- All of these data sources can bring datasets (files) into your Galaxy workspace (history)

???

This shows the list of data sources that were available on usegalaxy.org in mid 2017.

---

Two large data sources you can access through Galaxy are UCSC and SRA

.pull-right[![](../../images/get_data_ucsc.png)]
.pull-left[![](../../images/get_data_sra.png)]

---

# 2. Import from Shared Data Library

---

.pull-left[

- Top menu bar -> Shared Data -> Data Libraries

- Configured by a Galaxy Administator

- Can be imported directly into your history

- Example: all GTN tutorial data]


.pull-right[![](../../images/get_data_data_libraries.png)]

---

You can select the files you want and send to History as datasets or collection

.image-75[![](../../images/get_data_import_library.png)]

---


# 3. Upload from your computer

---

.image-50[![click on upload button](../../images/upload_button.png)]

![Upload file form](../../images/upload_file_form_empty.png)

???

- The **Upload File** data source can import data:
  - from your computer
  - by directly entering text
  - using a URL
  - and via FTP

This is probably the most commonly used tool for bringing data into Galaxy, and it is installed on almost every Galaxy server.

---

# Choose files


![Options for importing files from your laptop](../../images/upload_file_form_empty_local_choices.png)

???

- Drag and drop is supported
- as is the standard file selection using your browser.

---

# Set Metadata

- **Datatype** (e.g. FastQ, VCF, BAM, tabular, ..)
  - Galaxy will autodetect by default (sometimes guesses wrong)
- **Genome Build** (e.g. hg19, mm9, ..)
  - must be set manually (can be done later as well)

![](../../images/upload_file_file_list.png)

???

- Here we have imported 13 files
  - one with genome annotation in GTF format
  - 12 paired end read files from an RNA-Seq experiment*
  - could import them now and have Galaxy guess at their file types.

  * From UC Davis Training Material.


---

- Can be set for all files at once:

![Set datatype for all imported datasets](../../images/upload_file_set_all_datatype.png)

---

- Or per file:

![Manually set datatype for one dataset](../../images/upload_file_set_individual_file_type.png)

???

- Here we are manually setting the first dataset's datatype to GTF, a common genome annotation format.

---

# Start upload process:

- Once everything is ready, click the **Start** button

![Ready to upload files. Click on start](../../images/upload_file_ready.png)

???

- Data transfer does not start until you click Start.

---
You can then close the form

![Ready to upload files. Click on start](../../images/upload_file_in_progress.png)

???

---

All the items will appear in your history

![Files are loaded into your current history.](../../images/files_uploaded_into_history.png)

and are ready to use when green.

---

## Directly enter text

---

- Sometimes it's useful to file content directly.
  - only works if your dataset is tiny
  - choose **Paste/Fetch data**

![Select Paste/Fetch data](../../images/upload_file_form_empty_paste.png)

---

Enter the data by typing (or pasting) it in the input box:

![Select Paste/Fetch data](../../images/upload_paste_direct.png)

You can also set the datatype and build.
*Click* **Start**, and then **Close**, and the new item shows up as **Pasted Entry** in your history.

---

## Import using URL

---

The data might already be available on a web server somewhere. To avoid downloading data
to your computer and uploading to Galaxy in two steps, you can instruct Galaxy to
directly fetch the data from a given URL.


![Select Paste/Fetch data](../../images/upload_file_form_empty_paste.png)

 Select **Paste/Fetch data**


---

Enter the URLs (one per line) into the input box:

![Select Paste/Fetch data](../../images/fetch_from_url.png)

*Click* **Start**, and then **Close**, and the new items show up in your history with the URL as their name.

---

# Import using FTP

---

- Why use FTP?
  - Older Galaxies did not support uploading files larger than 2GB in size
  - Many people are very comfortable using FTP to upload large datasets and you can sometimes resume interrupted uploads.

- How to use FTP
  - The Galaxy server's administrator must have [enabled FTP](https://galaxyproject.org/admin/config/upload-via-ftp/) on the server
  - You will need to create an account on that Galaxy Server
  - You will need to install FTP software, or to run FTP from the shell
  - See https://galaxyproject.org/ftp-upload/

---

## Make sure you have an FTP client installed

.pull-right[.image-25[![FileZilla](../../images/FileZilla_logo.png)]]

- [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) is a free FTP client that is available on [Windows](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=win64), [MacOS](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=osx), and [Linux](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=linux)
- There are many other options
- If you don't already have an FTP client, download and install FileZilla.

---

## Establish FTP connection to your Galaxy server

- Provide
  - the instance's FTP server name (e.g. usegalaxy.org, ftp.usegalaxy.eu)
  - your full **username** (usually an email address) and **password**

![FTP Connection Params](../../images/ftp_client_connect.png)

---

![Successfully connect](../../images/ftp_client_connected.png)

Successfully connected

---

![Navigate to the files you want to transfer](../../images/ftp_client_upload.png)

Right click on the files and upload them.

---

![FTP transfer in progress](../../images/ftp_client_transferring.png)

FTP Transfer in progress...

---

![FTP transfer complete](../../images/ftp_client_transferred.png)

... and transfer complete.

---

# Where did my files go?

- File Upload menu -> **Choose FTP files**

![choose FTP files](../../images/upload_ftp_import.png)

---

- Select files to import into your history
- Click **Start**

![choose FTP files](../../images/upload_ftp_import2.png)

???

As you can see, this dialog gives connection settings too

---

# Import directly into Collection

---

- Select **Collection** tab at top of upload menu
- Add files as before (upload from computer, paste/fetch, FTP)

![Direct collection Start](../../images/get_data_direct_collection1.png)

---

- Choose collection type (at bottom)
- Set metadata (file type, genome build)
- Click "Build"

![Direct collection Build](../../images/get_data_direct_collection2.png)

---

- Name your collection
- Click **Create** button

![Direct collection Name](../../images/get_data_direct_collection3.png)

---

- Collection is now imported in your history
- Click on it to expand it and view all files in collection

![Direct collection History](../../images/get_data_direct_collection4.png)

---

# Import using Rule Based uploader

---

- When you want to import many files from URLs or Accession IDs directly into collection(s)
- Supports advanced "rules" for creating collections from sample sheets
- Click **Rule-based** tab at top of file upload window

![Rule Uploader](../../images/get_data_rule_uploader.png)

---

# Import using Rule Based uploader

Learn how to use it in the dedicated [Rule Based Uploader tutorial](
