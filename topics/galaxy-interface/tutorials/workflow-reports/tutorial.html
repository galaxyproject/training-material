                <p>Workflows are a powerful Galaxy feature that allows you to scale up your analysis by performing an end-to-end analysis with a single click of a button. In order to aid interpretation of workflow results, <em>workflow reports</em> may be configured to combine and display the most important analysis results in a single, customizable view.</p>

<p>This is especially useful if you are configuring a Galaxy workflow to share with others. Not everybody is familiar with Galaxy, and having all the important results shown on a single page can be very useful.</p>

<p>This tutorial will guide you through the steps of defining such a report for your workflow, and how to view workflow reports after running the workflow.</p>

<h1 id="import-an-example-workflow">Import an example workflow</h1>

<p>For this tutorial, we will use the workflow from the <a href="/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-101-everyone/tutorial.html">Galaxy 101 for everyone tutorial</a>. If you have not done this tutorial yet, the only thing you need to know is that this is a workflow that takes as input a table of data about different species of iris plants, this table is subsequently sorted and filtered, and some plots are made. The specifics of the workflow are not important for this tutorial, only that it outputs a number of different kinds of outputs (images, tables, etc).</p>

<p>We will start by importing this workflow into your Galaxy account:</p>

<p>Galaxy will produce a default report for any workflow. This default report shows the workflow inputs, outputs, and a description of the workflow on a single web page. You will usually want to customize this report yourself, but it provides a good starting point.</p>

Below are the results for the Iris analysis workflow.

This workflow was run on:

<span class="p">```</span><span class="nl">galaxy

With Galaxy version:

    <li>Let’s try to add the missing plot outputs as well:
      <ul>
        <li>On the left-hand panel, under the <strong>History</strong> section, choose <strong>Image</strong></li>
        <li>You should see a list of outputs to insert into the report:

        <li>Hmmm, no obvious options to insert the plot outputs. We will need to <strong>label the outputs</strong> in our workflow first, before we can use them here.</li>
      </ul>

<p>Well done! You have created a customized workflow report with text and workflow outputs. There are a lot more options to explore, for example you can also include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>links to datasets for easy downloading</li>
  <li>index files (e.g. for BAM or VCF files)</li>
  <li>visualisations</li>
  <li>job metrics</li>
  <li>peeks into dataset (useful for large files that cannot be included in their entirety in the report)</li>
  <li>..and more!</li>
