<h1 id="building-urls-from-accession-information">Building URLs from Accession Information</h1>

<p>In the previous examples the metadata we started with already contained URLs. In some cases such URLs will not be present in the available metadata and may need to be constructed dynamically from identifiers.</p>

<p>For this multiomics example, we will start with a uniprot query and build URLs from accession numbers contained within the supplied tabular data. Consider the uniprot query <a href="https://uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=proteome:UP000052092+AND+proteomecomponent:%22Genome%22">https://uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=proteome:UP000052092+AND+proteomecomponent:”Genome”</a>, pictured below.</p>

<p>In order to make this data useful for the Rule Builder, we need to turn these accessoin IDs into URLs.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Open <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/E7C0H6">Uniprot</a></li>
    <li><strong>Click</strong> on one of the entries in the table (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E7C0H6</code>)</li>
    <li><strong>Select</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Format</code> from the top menu</li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Click</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FASTA (canonical)</code></p>

    </li>
    <li>We can deduce that the FASTA files for the other accession IDs will be available from URLs of the form <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/{identifier}.fasta</code>
<!-- https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/search?format=fasta&includeIsoform=true&query=accession:E7C0H6  is also an option, for future editors. --></li>

<p>We will use this information to build a collection of FASTA files from our query.</p>

        <p>This example is ready to go, but before clicking “Build” it may be interesting to check out the rules Galaxy is following to clean and import your data. Click the little Wrench icon at the top of the list of rules. The result is a bunch of JavaScript object notation (JSON) text that you should never need to worry about but that you can build or modify by hand if you find it useful. We will use it the next example to quickly restore the list builder back to this state.</p>

<h1 id="building-matched-collections">Building Matched Collections</h1>

<p>This example will demonstrate creating multiple collections at the same time. We will use the same metadata generated from UniProt as the last example but we will build two collections with matching list identifiers - one collection of FASTA files and one collection of GFF files. This will also demonstrate reading the collection name and the target datatype from the metadata itself - important techniques if generating multiple collections with different names and datatypes.</p>

<p>For this example we will re-use the metadata from the <a href="#example-3-metadata">previous example</a>.</p>

      <p>This next part may seem a bit silly at first but we are going to add some columns with fixed values into the builder. When we split up the columns at a later step this will make sense.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>From <strong>Column</strong> menu, select  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fixed Value</code></p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>“Value”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fasta</code></li>
        <li>Click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Apply</code></li>
      </ul>

      <p>This value will eventually be used for the datatype of the file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Repeat</strong> this process with:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>“Value”</em>:<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UP000052092 FASTA</code></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Next we will repeat the process of adding URL, name, and datatype columns but for GFF files.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>From <strong>Column</strong>, select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Using a Regular Expression</code></p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>“From Column”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code></li>
        <li>Select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Create column from expression replacement</code></li>
        <li><em>“Regular Expression”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.*</code></li>
        <li><em>“Replacement Expression”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/\0.gff</code>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p><a href="https://galaxy-tests.s3.amazonaws.com/galaxy-gtn-screenshots/local/rules_example_5_5_url.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://galaxy-tests.s3.amazonaws.com/galaxy-gtn-screenshots/local/rules_example_5_5_url.png" alt="screenshot. " loading="lazy" /></a></p>

  <p>Next we will add two more columns</p>
  <ol>
    <li>From <strong>Column</strong> menu, select  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fixed Value</code>
      <ul>
        <li><em>“Value”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gff3</code></li>
        <li>Click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Apply</code></li>
      </ul>

      <p>This value will eventually be used for the datatype of the file.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Repeat</strong> this process with:
      <ul>
        <li><em>“Value”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UP000052092 GFF3</code></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Your very large list of rules should now look like the following screenshot.
<a href="https://galaxy-tests.s3.amazonaws.com/galaxy-gtn-screenshots/local/rules_example_5_6_presplit.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://galaxy-tests.s3.amazonaws.com/galaxy-gtn-screenshots/local/rules_example_5_6_presplit.png" alt="screenshot. " loading="lazy" /></a></p>

      <p>Notice we have two URLs, two collection names, and two datatype extensions for each accession ID we started with. Like in the example where we split the columns, here we will split these up to describe multiple collections.</p>
    </li>
    <li>From <strong>Rules</strong> menu, select  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Split Columns</code>
      <ul>
        <li><em>“Odd Row Column(s)”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E</code> (the fasta columns)</li>
        <li><em>“Even Row Column(s)”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">G</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H</code> (the gff3 columns)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This will take the row consisting of the columns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABCDEFGH</code> and build two rows, one with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABCDEF</code> and the other with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABFGH</code>
<a href="https://galaxy-tests.s3.amazonaws.com/galaxy-gtn-screenshots/local/rules_example_5_7_split_columns.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://galaxy-tests.s3.amazonaws.com/galaxy-gtn-screenshots/local/rules_example_5_7_split_columns.png" alt="screenshot. " loading="lazy" /></a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Apply</code> and you should be returned the list of rules.
<a href="https://galaxy-tests.s3.amazonaws.com/galaxy-gtn-screenshots/local/rules_example_5_8_split.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://galaxy-tests.s3.amazonaws.com/galaxy-gtn-screenshots/local/rules_example_5_8_split.png" alt="screenshot. " loading="lazy" /></a></p>

      <p>Finally, we need to add some more column definitions for these new columns we just created:</p>
    </li>
    <li>From <strong>Rules</strong> menu, select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add / Modify Column Definitions</code>
      <ul>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add Definition</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">List Identifier</code>, Column <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code></li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add Definition</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Info</code>, Column <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code></li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add Definition</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">URL</code>, Column <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code></li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add Definition</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Type</code>, Column <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D</code></li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add Definition</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Collection Name</code>, Column <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E</code></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Notice when these values are being generated from the metadata the option to specify them manually from the <strong>type</strong> and <strong>collection name</strong> boxes from the bottom of the form disappear.
<a href="https://galaxy-tests.s3.amazonaws.com/galaxy-gtn-screenshots/local/rules_example_5_9_mapping.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://galaxy-tests.s3.amazonaws.com/galaxy-gtn-screenshots/local/rules_example_5_9_mapping.png" alt="screenshot. " loading="lazy" /></a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Upload</code></p>

      <p>Galaxy should make two collections - one containing FASTA files and one containing GFF3 files.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

</blockquote>

<h1 id="building-nested-lists">Building Nested Lists</h1>

<p>In this example, we will be building a nested list using data from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra">SRA</a>. This is a more sophisticated structure for organizing datasets in Galaxy. In the above examples we organized datasets into simple lists with a single “list identifier” describing the files in the collection. Galaxy allows lists to be organized into nested lists - where each level of the list has an identifier.</p>

<p>If two such identifiers are present, this is a list of lists (called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">list:list</code> in the workflow editor). In such a structure the outer identifiers (or first level of identifiers) may describe sample names and the inner identifiers (or second level) may describe replicates. Alternative the outer identifiers may describe conditions and the inner identifiers may describe individual samples. The structure of such collections should ideally be dictated by the study design.</p>

<p>If certain parts of your analysis require benefit from datasets being nested this way while other parts require feeding you data to a Galaxy tool all together without such a structure, then it is probably best to go ahead and build nested lists at the start of your analysis and then use the “Flatten Collection” tool on the resulting collection or a derivative collection to get the flat structure needed by certain tools in certain parts of your analysis.</p>

<p>For this example, we will describe analyzing the metadata of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=PRJNA355367&amp;cmd=DetailsSearch">SRA project PRJNA355367</a>. Unlike the other examples, these SRA files are relatively large and not ideal for training purposes. So we’ve pre-downloaded the project metadata and replaced all the links with simple text files that should download really quickly - the <a href="./PRJNA355367.tsv">result is here</a>.</p>

<p>So use either the SRA exporter tool or download the CSV file with fake URLs. If you download the data from the SRA exporter tool, select only the first 12 columns from the data (up to the column labeled “Library Name”) and copy the resulting data to your clipboard.</p>

      <p>For the analysis we wish to do, we want to group these files based on the type indicated in column <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">L</code> (LibraryName) shown below.
The source data though adds numbers to the library type to generate the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LibraryName</code>, so we need to strip those out to use the type
as an identifier for grouping the datasets. To do this, use the regex column adder rule again.</p>

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Finalize the collection:
      <ul>
        <li><em>“Type”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">txt</code></li>
        <li>Give the collection a name.</li>

" loading="lazy" /></a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>The first thing we will do to this new collection is add some levels or depth to its structure.
Lets assume we want to group it into “treated” and “untreated” lists and “paired” and “single”
sublists below that. We can do this with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Apply Rules</code> collection operation tool, which will
likely be under the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Collection Operations</code> tool menu in your Galaxy interface.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Open the <strong>Apply Rules</strong> tool</p>

      <p>The very simple interface should look something like this:
<a href="https://galaxy-tests.s3.amazonaws.com/galaxy-gtn-screenshots/local/rules_apply_rules_example_4_5_apply_rules_landing.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://galaxy-tests.s3.amazonaws.com/galaxy-gtn-screenshots/local/rules_apply_rules_example_4_5_apply_rules_landing.png" alt="screenshot. " loading="lazy" /></a></p>

      <p>This interface simply lets one pick a collection to operate on and then launch the rule builder
window to work to describe and preview manipulating the metadata of that collection.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Apply Rules</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">tool</span> with the following parameters:
      <ul>
        <li><em>“Input Collection”</em>: the collection we just uploaded</li>
        <li>Click the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Edit</code> button

" loading="lazy" /></a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>When a flat collection is used with this tool, the rule builder will initialize a default rule to pull
the list identifier out for each item of the collection as shown above. Next we will use regular expressions
to build two new columns, these columns will group the datasets into “treated” and “untreated” sublists and
then “single” and “paired” sublists of that. This rule is found under the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Column</code> menu.</p>

      <p>We’ll transform column A into some more useful columns</p>
    </li>
    <li>From <strong>Column</strong>, select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Using a Regular Expression</code>
      <ul>
        <li><em>“Column”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code></li>
        <li>Select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Create columns matching expression groups</code></li>
        <li><em>“Regular Expression”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(.*)_(.*)_.*</code></li>
        <li><em>“Number of Groups”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code></li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote class="comment">

        <p>Here <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.*</code> means match any number of any character - so basically match anything.
 The parentheses around <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.*</code> means form a “group” from whatever is matched.
 The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_</code> describes the literal <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_</code> values in the identifier we are matching. The result is that
everything before the first <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_</code> will be matched as the first group and everything between the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_</code>
characters will be matched as the second group. Click to apply this rule and two new columns should be created.</p>

        <p>We have defined two matching groups (the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(.*)</code> in the regex), so the number of groups is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code></p>

    </li>
    <li>From  <strong>Rules</strong>, select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add / Modify Column Definitions</code>

      <p>The resulting collection should have two new levels of depth for “untreated” vs “treated” and “paired” vs “single” as shown below:

" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

      <p>Placing the “single” and “paired” sublists inside the “treated” and “untreated” lists was a bit arbitrary and depending on the
workflow these may need to be inverted at different parts of an analysis. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Apply Rules</code> tool can be used to invert these levels
if that is needed.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Apply Rules</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">tool</span> with the following parameters:
      <ul>

      </ul>

" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

      <p>Notice when loading a nested collection into the rule builder, there is a column for each layer of the list for each element.
One can pretty easily invert the outer two layers of the list by simply assigning the list identifiers in a new order. So select to assign “List Identifiers” and this time assign them to columns “B”, “A”, and “C” - in that order.</p>
    </li>
    <li>From <strong>Rules</strong>, select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add / Modify Column Definitions</code>

      <p>In addition to structural re-organizations of a collection, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Apply Rules</code> tool can be used to
filter elements out of the collection.</p>

    <li><strong>Apply Rules</strong> <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">tool</span> with the following parameters:

      <p>The resulting collection should be a filtered version of the original list.</p>

      <p>Structural re-organizations of collections can also be combined with filtering. To demonstrate this, reopen the original flat list created for this example again in the rule builder of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Apply Rules</code> tool. Use the same regular expression as last time to filter the result but also add a column for “treated” and “untreated” list identifiers.</p>
