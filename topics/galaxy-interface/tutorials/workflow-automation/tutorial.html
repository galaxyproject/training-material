                <p>Galaxy is well-known as a web-based data analysis platform which provides a graphical interface for executing common bioinformatics tools in a reproducible manner. However, Galaxy is not just a user-friendly interface for executing one tool at a time. It provides two very useful features which allow scaling data analyses up to a high-throughput level: dataset collections and workflows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Dataset collections represent groups of similar datasets. This doesn’t sound especially exciting, but it gets interesting when a tool is executed using a collection as input, where a single dataset would normally be created. In this case, Galaxy creates a new job for every dataset contained within the collection, and stores the tool outputs in a new collection (or collections, if there are multiple outputs) with the same size and structure as the input. This process is referred to as ‘mapping over’ the input collection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workflows are pipelines made up of multiple Galaxy tools executed in sequence. When a workflow is executed, Galaxy schedules all the jobs which need to be run to produce the workflow outputs. They will remain scheduled (represented by the familiar grey color in the Galaxy history) until the required inputs become available. After they complete, they will make their outputs available, which allows the next set of jobs to begin.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Between them, collections and workflows make it possible to scale-up from running a single tool on a single dataset to running multiple tools on multiple datasets.</p>

<h2 id="why-use-the-command-line">Why use the command line?</h2>

<p>All the functionality described so far is available through the graphical interface. So why use the command line? Let’s consider a couple of scenarios:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You want to run some molecular dynamics simulations to perform free energy calculations for protein-ligand binding. You have a compound library of 1000 ligands and would like to run an ensemble of 10 simulations for each. You would like to have the analysis for each ligand in a separate history, with the ensembles represented as dataset collections, which means you need to invoke your workflow 1000 times - theoretically possible to do in the graphical interface, but you probably want to avoid it if possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are conducting research on a virus which is responsible for a deadly pandemic. New genomic data from the virus is being produced constantly, and you have a variant calling workflow which will tell you if a particular sample contains new mutations. You would like to run this workflow as soon as the data appears - every day perhaps, or even every hour. This will be quite tough if you have to click a button each time yourself.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you are encountering similar problems as these in your research with Galaxy, this tutorial is for you! We will explain how to trigger workflow execution via the command line using Planemo, and provide some tips on how to write scripts to automate the process. The result will be a bot which takes care of the the whole analysis process for you.</p>

If you ever developed a Galaxy tool, you probably encountered the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">planemo test</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">planemo serve</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">planemo lint</code> subcommands. In this tutorial we will be using a different subcommand: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">planemo run</code>.</p>

<h2 id="get-the-workflow-and-prepare-the-job-file">Get the workflow and prepare the job file</h2>

<p>For this section, we will use a very simple workflow consisting of two text manipulation tools chained together.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tutorial.ga</code> file defines the workflow in JSON format; if we are confident we have a functional workflow, we don’t need to worry about its contents or modify it. However, we need a second file, the so-called ‘job file’, which specifies the particular dataset and parameter inputs which should be used to execute the workflow. We can create a template for this file using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">planemo workflow_job_init</code> subcommand.</p>

<h2 id="running-the-workflow">Running the workflow</h2>

<p>Now we have a simple workflow, we can run it using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">planemo run</code>. At this point you need to choose a Galaxy server on which you want the workflow to run. One of the big public servers would be a possible choice. You could also use a local Galaxy instance. Either way, once you’ve chosen a server, the next step is to get your API key.</p>

<h2 id="using-galaxy-workflow-and-dataset-ids">Using Galaxy workflow and dataset IDs</h2>

<p>We’ve now executed the same workflow twice. If you inspect your histories and workflows through the Galaxy web interface, you will see that a new workflow was created on the server for each invocation, and both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dataset 1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dataset 2</code> were uploaded twice. This is undesirable - we are creating a lot of clutter and the uploads are creating additional unnecessary work for the Galaxy server.</p>

<p>Every object associated with Galaxy, including workflows, datasets and dataset collections, have hexadecimal IDs associated with them, which look something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">6b15dfc0393f172c</code>. Once the datasets and workflows we need have been uploaded to Galaxy once, we can use these IDs in our subsequent workflow invocations.</p>

<h2 id="using-planemo-profiles">Using Planemo profiles</h2>

<p>Planemo provides a useful profile feature which can help simplify long commands. The idea is that flags which need to be used multiple times in different invocations can be combined together and run as a single profile. Let’s see how this works below.</p>

<h1 id="automated-runs-of-a-workflow-for-sars-cov-2-lineage-assignment">Automated runs of a workflow for SARS-CoV-2 lineage assignment</h1>

<p>It’s now time to apply your newly acquired knowledge of workflow execution with Planemo to a relevant scientific problem.</p>

<h2 id="scientific-background">Scientific background</h2>

<p>The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been accompanied by unprecedented world-wide sequencing efforts. One of the accepted goals behind sequencing hundreds of thousands of individual viral isolates is to monitor the evolution and spreading of viral lineages in as close as real time as possible. Viral lineages are characterized by defining patterns of mutations that make them different from each other and from the original virus that started the pandemic at the beginning of 2020. Examples of viral lineages are B.1.1.7, first observed in the UK in the fall of 2020 and now termed <em>variant of concern (VOC) alpha</em> according to the WHO’s classification system, and B.1.617.2, first seen in India at the beginning of 2021 and now recognized as <em>VOC delta</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://cov-lineages.org/pangolin.html">Pangolin</a> is a widely used tool for assigning newly sequenced viral isolates to established viral lineages, and in this final section of this tutorial you are going to run a workflow that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>takes a collection of variant datasets in the <em>variant call format</em> VCF,</p>

    <p>where you can think of a collection as representing a batch of freshly sequenced viral isolates with each of its VCF datasets listing the nucleotide differences between one sample and the sequence of an original SARS-CoV-2 reference isolate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reconstructs the viral genome sequence of each sample by incorporating its variants into the reference isolate’s sequence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>uses Pangolin to classify the resulting collection of genome sequences in FASTA format and to create a report of lineage assignments for all samples.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Just like in a real world situation, you will receive VCF files for several batches of samples and you will face the challenge of uploading the files from each batch as a collection into Galaxy and of triggering a run of the workflow for each of them.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-the-bot">Setting up the bot</h2>

<p>Unlike for the previous toy example you will not get complete step-by-step instructions, but you are supposed to try yourself to transfer the knowledge from part 1 to this new, more complex task.</p>

<p>Every step along the way comes with solutions, which you can expand at any time, but you’re encouraged to give each problem some thought first.</p>

<p>As a very first step, however, let’s look at how the material for this part is arranged.</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">

<p>The file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vcf2lineage.ga</code> defines the workflow just described, while the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data/</code> folder holds the batches of VCF files we would, ultimately, like to run the workflow on.</p>

        <p>The job file contains three inputs: the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Reference genome</code>, a collection of VCF files (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Variant calls</code>) and a float parameter for the minimum allele frequency (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">min-AF for consensus variant</code>).

<p>We have now performed a test invocation of the vcf2lineage workflow. It was already more challenging than the first example; for the first time, we needed to resort to writing a script to achieve a task, in this case the construction of the job file.</p>

<p>The next step is to automate this process so we can run the workflow on each of the 10 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">batch*/</code> directories in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data/</code> folder. We can imagine that these are newly produced data released at regular intervals, which need to be analysed.</p>

    <li>
      <p>If we want to execute the workflow multiple times, we will once again encounter the issue that the datasets and workflow will be reuploaded each time. To avoid this, let’s obtain the dataset ID for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Reference genome</code> (which stays the same for each invocation) and the workflow ID for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vcf2lineage.ga</code> workflow.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Now let’s create a template job file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vcf2lineage-job-template.yml</code> which we can modify at each invocation as necessary. We can start with the output of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">workflow_job_init</code> and add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Reference genome</code> dataset ID and set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">min-AF for consensus variant</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.7</code> again.</p>

        <p>Uploads can cause several issues:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The default planemo behavior is to upload datasets one at a time, which ensures the server cannot be overloaded, but is slow. To upload all datasets simultaneously, you could use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--simultaneous_uploads</code> flag.</li>
          <li>If one of the upload jobs fails, the workflow will by default not be invoked - Planemo will just upload the datasets and finish. To override this behavior and start a workflow even if one or more uploads fail, you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--no_check_uploads_ok</code> flag.</li>
          <li>For a more complex solution to the issue of failed uploads, see <a href="https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/ena-cog-uk-wfs/blob/main/bioblend-scripts/ftp_links_to_yaml.py">this script</a> from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ena-cog-uk-wfs</code> repo.</li>

<h2 id="more-advanced-solutions">More advanced solutions</h2>

<p>This was a very basic example of a workflow. Perhaps for your case, you need a more customized solution.</p>

<p>For example, it might be the case that you want to run multiple different workflows, one after another. In this case you would need to implement some sort of check to verify if one invocation had finished, before beginning with the next one. Planemo will probably not be enough for a task like this; you will need to resort to using the lower-level <a href="https://bioblend.readthedocs.io/">BioBlend</a> library to interact directly with the Galaxy API.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/ena-cog-uk-wfs/">Galaxy SARS-CoV-2 genome surveillance bot</a> provides an example of a more advanced customized workflow execution solution, combining Planemo commands, custom BioBlend scripts and bash scripts, which then get run automatically via continuous integration (CI) on a Jenkins server.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>You should now have a better idea about how to run Galaxy workflows from the command line and how to apply the ideas you have learnt to your own project.</p>
