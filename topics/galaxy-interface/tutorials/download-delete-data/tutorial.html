                <p>This tutorial outlines the process to get your data out of Galaxy and to delete it from Galaxy afterwards.</p>

<p>After you have completed your analysis on a Galaxy server, you may need to download the results for use in reports, papers, or other requirements. Galaxy has a myriad of methods for downloading data from individual datasets to a collection of data to an entire history along with all of its metadata. The first section of this tutorial will walk you through all of these methods.</p>

<p>On some Galaxy servers, user disk quotas have been enabled meaning that users are only able to store a certain amount of data on that particular Galaxy server. Quotas can differ on different servers. User disk quotas for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">usegalaxy.*</code> servers are shown in the table below:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Galaxy Server</th>
      <th>Unregistered User</th>
      <th>Registered User</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>usegalaxy.org</td>
      <td>5 GB</td>
      <td>250 GB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>usegalaxy.eu</td>
      <td>5 GB</td>
      <td>250 GB or 500 GB for Elixir Members</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>usegalaxy.org.au</td>
      <td>5 GB</td>
      <td>100 GB or 600GB for Australian Users</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Other Galaxy servers may have different quota systems.</p>

<p>As you use a Galaxy server and upload data, perform analyses etc. you will use up your quota. If you have filled your quota and you want to do some new work, you can download your old work and delete it off the Galaxy server to free up quota space. Galaxy uses a two step process to delete user data from disk. The first step is to delete the data - this marks the data as deleted but it can be undeleted for a certain time<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. The second step is to purge the deleted data - this removes the deleted data from the disk and it is no longer recoverable. Note that any data that has been shared with another user will not be deleted from disk unless the other users also delete it.</p>

<p>The second section of this tutorial will outline how to delete data from your user space and to purge it from disk if you so desire.</p>

<h1 id="downloading-data-from-galaxy">Downloading Data from Galaxy</h1>

<p>There are multiple ways of downloading your data from Galaxy, the choice of which method to use depends on the amount of data you wish to download. You can download a single dataset, multiple datasets all the way to entire histories.</p>

<h2 id="downloading-a-single-file-from-galaxy">Downloading a single file from Galaxy</h2>

<p>The easiest way to get your data is to download a single dataset from a history.</p>

<p>The following example steps through the process using a generic history. The history pictured in the screenshots will most likely not appear in your Galaxy server but the process will be the same.</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <div class="box-title hands-on-title" id="hands-on-download-a-single-file"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Hands-on: Download a single file</div>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>In the History pane, click on the name of the file you wish to download. This will expand the file in the History to show more details about it.</p>

      <p><a href="../../images/download-delete/expanded_file_history.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/download-delete/expanded_file_history.png" alt="expanded file history. " width="264" height="600" loading="lazy" /></a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Click the <i class="far fa-save" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">galaxy-save</span> <strong>Download</strong> button. The dataset will now be downloaded to your computer.</p>

      <p><a href="../../images/download-delete/file_download_button.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/download-delete/file_download_button.png" alt="download button. " width="260" height="369" loading="lazy" /></a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>

</blockquote>

<p>Repeat this for any other data file you want in this or other histories.</p>

<h2 id="download-multiple-datasets">Download multiple datasets</h2>

<p>Sometimes you may want to download multiple datasets at once and doing them one by one can be a pain. Luckily, Galaxy has a mechanism for creating Collections. For more details about collections and how to create them, see <a href="/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/collections/tutorial.html">this tutorial</a> from the Galaxy Training Network.</p>

<p>The concept is very simple however, we are just going to lump together our files of interest and download them all at once.</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <div class="box-title hands-on-title" id="hands-on-download-multiple-datasets"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Hands-on: Download multiple datasets</div>

  <p><strong>Create a collection of the files you want</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Click on the <strong>Collections</strong> button at the top of the History pane (the little checkbox)</p>

      <p>This shows a different view of the History. Each file now has a checkbox next to it and there are some new buttons in the header section of the History.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Select the files you want by clicking on their checkboxes, you can also select all or none of them.</p>

    <li>
      <p>Once you have selected everything you want, click the <strong>for all selected</strong> button and then <strong>Build Dataset List</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A new interface opens, showing you the files you have selected. Give the list a name in the appropriate box and click <strong>Create</strong></p>

<p>You can repeat this process for other sets of files you want to download in other histories.</p>

<h2 id="download-export-an-entire-history-including-its-metadata">Download (export) an entire history including its metadata</h2>

<p>The third way to download data from Galaxy is by Exporting a history in its entirety. This will allow you to download all of the data in a history as well as all of the metadata associated with it such as the tools used, their versions, the parameters chosen etc. It is downloaded as a single file archive. Once downloaded, you can also Import this history into another Galaxy server.</p>

<p>Depending on the size of the files and the complexity of the history, it can take quite some time to create the archive before download. For example it can take over 24 hours to create an archive file of a 50GB history. It may be simpler just to download the individual files of interest as outlined above.</p>

<h1 id="deleting-data-from-galaxy">Deleting Data from Galaxy</h1>

<p>Once you have downloaded everything that you want to keep from your Galaxy account, you can delete the data and histories your no longer require.</p>

<p>Deletion in Galaxy is a two stage process. If you delete something, it actually only gets marked as deleted and then is hidden. To actually delete an object you must purge it from disk. The instructions for how to delete datasets and histories follow.</p>

<h2 id="delete-a-single-dataset">Delete a single dataset</h2>

<p>This section will show you how to delete and then purge a single dataset from a history. You can also delete multiple datasets and then purge them all at once.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>This tutorial should have explained to you how to manage your data on Galaxy. Different Galaxy servers will have different policies regarding storage quotas and storage times. You should check with the Galaxy server you are using.</p>

<h5 id="footnotes">Footnotes:</h5>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>On some Galaxy servers, data and histories marked for deletion are periodically purged by the administrators. This period of time can vary between servers and you should check with the documentation or administrators of your server to know the exact amount of time. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a> <a href="#fnref:1:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;<sup>2</sup></a></p>
