<h1 id="uploading-datasets-with-rules">Uploading Datasets with Rules</h1>

<p>This approach could be used to manipulate lists of uploads coming from many different formats, but we will start with a tabular description of files for a study from the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena">European Nucleotide Archive</a>. We will be using the data from a study of <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJDA60709">16s ribosomal RNA</a>.</p>

  <p>To start, navigate to the above study and click the option to “Show Column Selection”. Here we will narrow the set of columns we consider to just a few relevant to uploading these files to Galaxy.</p>

  <p>Select only:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">study_accession</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">experiment_accession</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fastq_ftp</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sample_accession</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The table should look like:</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Study accession</th>

  <p>Download the resulting tabular data describing the files by clicking the “Download report: TSV” link above the table. Alternatively, the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=PRJDA60709&amp;result=read_run&amp;fields=study_accession,sample_accession,experiment_accession,fastq_ftp&amp;format=tsv&amp;download=true&amp;limit=0">resulting sample sheet can be downloaded directly</a>. The number and size of the files for this example are relatively small for sequencing data but larger files and larger numbers of files should work as well - Galaxy will just need more time to download and process the files.</p>

<p>At first glance, this may be feel like Excel or another spreadsheet program and you may feel the urge to start editing cells but we strongly encourage defining rules for manipulating the data instead. There are a few reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Manually modifying this metadata is not reproducible</strong> - we will not belabor the point here but check out <a href="/training-material/faqs/galaxy/why_not_excel.html">Why not use excel for this?</a> for more context. Building up rules for modifying this metadata will allow Galaxy to track and report your manipulations (providing traceability) and apply them to new sets of files (providing reproducibility).</li>
  <li><strong>Manually modifying this metadata is error prone</strong> - we believe defining rules and treating the metadata in a systematic way minimizes the possibility to manual errors. These errors can be very hard to detect for large sets of data.</li>
  <li><strong>Manually modifying data is not scalable</strong> - this rule-based technique potentially scales to importing tens of thousands of datasets.</li>
</ul>

<p>So rather than modifying the data, we will define rules for manipulating it and setting up “column definitions” that tell Galaxy how to use the metadata during upload or collection creation.</p>

<p>In order to get these files into Galaxy, we will want to do a few things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Strip that header out of the data (it doesn’t contain a URL Galaxy can download).</li>
  <li>Define column <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code> as the dataset name.</li>
  <li>Define column <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D</code> as the dataset URL (this is the location Galaxy can download the data from).</li>
  <li>Tell Galaxy to treat these files as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fastqsanger.gz</code> files.</li>
</ul>

  <p>We will start by stripping that header out of the table. We call rules that strip rows out the table <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Filter rules</code> in this dialog.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>From <strong>Filter</strong> menu select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">First or Last N Rows</code>
      <ul>
        <li><em>“Filter which rows?”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">first</code></li>

      </ul>

      <p>Next we will define these columns for Galaxy.</p>
    </li>
    <li>From <strong>Rules</strong> menu select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add / Modify Column Definitions</code>
      <ul>
        <li>Click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add Definition</code> button and select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Name</code>
          <ul>
            <li><em>“Name”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Repeat this again and select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">URL</code> instead.
          <ul>
            <li><em>“URL”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D</code></li>

      <p><strong>Click</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Apply</code>, and you should see your new column definitions listed as in the following screenshot.

      <p><strong>Click</strong> the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Upload</code> button</p>

<h1 id="creating-a-simple-dataset-list">Creating a Simple Dataset List</h1>

<p>This example will demonstrate using such history datasets as the source for collection uploads - this can be handy when you’d like to apply existing Galaxy tabular manipulation tools to the metadata before processing for instance.</p>

    <p>Before we start uploading, it may be a good idea to create a new history for this example to keep things simple and match the following screenshots.</p>

  <p>For our second example, we will use the same initial metadata, but instead uploaded as a file to Galaxy. This is a relatively common use case wherein you, through some filtering and querying in Galaxy, build a list of accession numbers or other sample identifiers, and then want to fetch the associated datasets to begin working with them.</p>

    <p>In addition to directly pasting data into the Rule Based Uploader, you can also load the metadata from a dataset in your Galaxy History, or from a file in your FTP directory if the admin has enabled FTP upload</p>

    <li><strong>Repeat</strong> the last example with:
      <ul>
        <li>From <strong>Filter</strong> menu select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">First or Last N Rows</code>
          <ul>
            <li><em>“Filter which rows?”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">first</code></li>
            <li><em>“Filter how many rows?”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>From <strong>Rules</strong> menu, select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add / Modify Column Definitions</code>
          <ul>
            <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add Definition</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">List Identifier(s)</code>, Column <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code></li>

        </li>
        <li><em>“Type”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fastqsanger.gz</code></li>
      </ul>

      <p>In this dataset, column <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D</code> contains two URLs, separated by a semicolon <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">;</code>. So we cannot define that column as the URL directly, we will need to split it into two columns first.
We will build a regular expression that captures two “groups” from this column with two URLs - one group for everything before the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">;</code> and one group for everything after.</p>
    </li>
    <li>From <strong>Column</strong>, select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Using a Regular Expression</code>
      <ul>
        <li><em>“From Column”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D</code></li>

        <li><em>“Regular Expression”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(.*);(.*)</code></li>
        <li><em>“Number of Groups”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code>

        <p>Here <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.*</code> means match any number of any character - so basically match anything.
The parentheses around <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.*</code> means form a “group” from whatever is matched. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">;</code> will match with the actual <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">;</code> in the target cells.
In his example we have two such matching groups.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Click <strong>Apply</strong> to apply the regular expression to the metadata table</p>

      <p>Column <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D</code> is no longer needed, so we can remove it:</p>
    </li>
    <li>From <strong>Rules</strong> select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Remove Column(s)</code>
      <ul>
        <li><em>“From Column”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D</code>

      </ul>

      <p>We now have two columns containing URLs - but we can only have one URL per row. So we will split each row into two (one for the forward reads and one for the reverse):</p>
    </li>
    <li>From <strong>Rules</strong> select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Split Column(s)</code>
      <ul>
        <li><em>“Odd Row Column(s)”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D</code></li>
        <li><em>“Even Row Column(s)”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E</code></li>
        <li>Click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Apply</code></li>

For every row before the transformation with columns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABCDE</code>, this will produce two rows, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABCD</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABCE</code>. Thus you will have twice as many rows as before.
<br /><br />
Now we need to inform Galaxy which of these rows are “forward” reads and which are “reverse” reads. We will do this by adding a new column again using a regular expression. Here we will match on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_1</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_2</code> in the filename at the end of the URLs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>From <strong>Column</strong>, select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Using a Regular Expression</code>
      <ul>
        <li><em>“Column”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D</code></li>
        <li>Select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Create columns matching expression groups</code></li>
        <li><em>“Regular Expression”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.*_(\d).fastq.gz</code></li>
        <li><em>“Number of groups”</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>

In his example we have one matching groups ( contained in the parentheses )</p>

      <p>At this point, you can swap the last two columns to bring this new paired indicator column toward the beginning of the table. This is not necessary but it makes the screenshots more informative.</p>

        <p>The column selector for paired indicator is a bit less obvious and a bit more picky than the other ones we have used. The row value of the paired indicator column must be one of the following to indicate “forward” or “reverse” reads.</p>
