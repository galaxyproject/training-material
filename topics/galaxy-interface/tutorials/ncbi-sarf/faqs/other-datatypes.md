We hope to have these constructed for long read SARS-CoV-2 data in the near future. If there is strong community interest we may expand this offering to other organisms or data types such as metagenome submissions. If you would like this format for other datasets, write to the SRA helpdesk ([sra@ncbi.nlm.nih](mailto:sra@ncbi.nlm.nih)) and let us know!
