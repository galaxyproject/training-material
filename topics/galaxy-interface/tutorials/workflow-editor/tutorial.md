# Introduction
{:.no_toc}


Workflows are a powerful feature in Galaxy that allow you to link multiple steps of complex analysis.
In this tutorial we will demonstrate how to use the Workflow Editor to construct multiple variants of a simple workflow. Note that these workflows are meant to illustrate different concepts. Not all workflows require using all of the features described below, but we hope this tutorial will inspire you to make your analysis tasks more efficient.

## Workflow steps

Workflows logically connect a collection of steps. Possible step types are
currently workflow inputs, tools, and workflows.


## Creating a new workflow

On the left hand side of the Editor you see the available tools in the tool
panel. The center panel (or "canvas") holds the workflow layout. Steps will
appear in the center panel. On the right you see the attributes of the
workflow, such as name, version, annotation and tags. Depending on the context
the contents of the right panel will change, but you can always return to these
attributes by clicking on the **Edit Attributes** button (the Pencil icon on
the upper right). If there is no Pencil icon you can find the **Edit Attributes**
button under the the Workflow options button (a wheel icon) on the top right of
the editor.

We will start by creating a very simple workflow with just 2 tools, and then
add more advanced features.

We're now ready to add a first tool and connect it to our input dataset.

This is great, but while a single tool in a workflow might be handy (for
instance if there are many parameters to be set), let's add another tool that
works on the output of **tac reverse a file (reverse cat)** {% icon tool %} for
an authentic workflow experience. From now on we'll contract steps 1 to 4 and
just mention the tool and parameters to insert, since the procedure is always
the same.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Add **Select first lines from a dataset** {% icon tool %} to your workflow

> 3. Save {% icon galaxy-save %} your workflow using the save button on the top right
{: .hands_on}

We now have a very simple workflow that will reverse the contents of a file and
then output the first line of the resulting dataset. Now we're ready to upload
a test dataset and run our workflow.

{: .hands_on}

The outputs of the workflow will now appear in your history.
In addition to our input file we will see 2 new datasets: `2: tac on data 1`
which contains the reversed dataset and `3: Select first on data 2` which just
contains the line `F`.

This is fine, but if we want to process many datasets at once the naming of
input datasets in the history will be difficult to follow.  Luckily we can use
dataset collections as inputs, which will maintain element identifiers across
all steps of an analysis. We can also add colorful tags that can help us identify
groups of datasets and we can label and rename outputs.

## Editing our simple workflow

We will now add tags to step outputs and label one of the 2 output datasets.

{: .hands_on}

You will now see only 1 new dataset collection, `Renamed datasets`, in your
history.  This is because we have labeled only the last step in the workflow.
This collection has 2 name tags, `reverse` and `first`. The other output collection
is hidden in the history but can be seen by clicking on `hidden` in your history.

We will now use this workflow and embed it in a new workflow.

## Embedding a workflow within a workflow

Another step type is the `subworkflow`. We can use this to include a section of
a workflow that is repeated within a workflow or a workflow that contains steps
that are useful in more than one workflow, so that we don't have to maintain
and update closely related workflows.

Here we will include our workflow twice within a new workflow and then paste the contents
of each workflow together.

> 2. Insert a dataset collection input

> 5. Label the new workflow step:
>     - *Label*: `First workflow`
> 6. Repeat steps 4 and 5, but change the Label
>    - *Label*: `Second workflow`
> 7. Insert **Paste two files side by side** {% icon tool %}
> 8. Connect the 2 workflow outputs to the **Paste two files side by side** {% icon tool %} input
> 9. Save {% icon galaxy-save %} your workflow using the save button on the top right
>    {% include snippets/run_workflow.md %}
>
{: .hands_on}

This is a very contrived example, but this technique can be used to separate
re-useable steps in real world scenarios.
