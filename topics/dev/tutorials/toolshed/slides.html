---

## 3. Tool Shed repository types

---

### 3.1 Tool with dependencies

---

###  Tool with dependencies

![tool folder with python script, xml, and test-data is put in an archive and uploaded to the TS.](../../images/toolshedPackage.png)

---

### 3.2 Tool suite

#### Group of related repositories

---

###  Tool suite

![multiple wrappers in a single tool archive](../../images/toolSuite.png)

- Works but no way to install a single tool

---

###  Tool suite

![phylogeny pipeline containing 4 tools](../../images/toolsuite2.png)

- One repository per individual tool
- A special &apos;Tool suite&apos; repository listing the individual repositories

---

###  Tool suite

- relationship between a dependent repository and one or more required repository (tools, datatypes, workflows,...)
- -&gt; One XML file
```xml
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;repositories description=&quot;Pipeline phylogeny&quot;&gt;
   &lt;repository toolshed=&quot;https://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu&quot;
     name=&quot;fasta_to_phylip&quot; owner=&quot;gandres&quot; changeset_revision=&quot;a895633568&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;repository name=&quot;mafft&quot; owner=&quot;gandres&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;repository name=&quot;phyml&quot; owner=&quot;gandres&quot; /&gt;
[…]
&lt;/repositories&gt;
```
No need to write it yourself, Planemo does it for you

---

###  Tool suite

![phylogeny suite gets uploaded to the TS](../../images/toolsuite3.png)

---

### 3.3 Workflow

---


###  Workflow
![the four tools from the phylogeny pipeline are connected as a workflow](../../images/workflow.png)
- A succession of tools to perform a complete analysis

---

###  Workflow

- In galaxy

![same workflow with galaxy ui](../../images/galaxyWorkflowEx.png)

---

###  Workflow

![extract workflow menu from galaxy](../../images/shareWorkflow.png)

- You get a file: Galaxy-Workflow-NAME.ga

---

###  Workflow

- You have your file Galaxy-Workflow-NAME.ga
- How to automatically install the tools used in the workflow?
  - -&gt; `repository_dependencies.xml`
```xml
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;repositories description=&quot;Phylogeny workflow&quot;&gt;
   &lt;repository name=&quot;suite_phylogeny&quot; owner=&quot;galaxy&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/repositories&gt;
```

---

###  Workflow

![phylogeny workflow is uploaded to the TS](../../images/workflowRepDep.png)

---

###  Workflow

![the workflow points at the tool suite which points at tools](../../images/workflowRepDep2.png)

- **Everything must be on the same toolshed**

---

## Tips

### What about tools working with *.loc files or new datatypes

---

### Tools with `*.loc` files or new datatypes

- add them to the Tool Shed repository.
- `*.loc` files and `datatypes` files should be provided as `*.sample` file in a `tool-data` directory.
- `tool-data/*.loc.sample` files come along with `tool_data_table_conf.xml.sample`.

Their content or the file themselves are put to the right location on tool set up.

---

### Tools with *.loc files or new datatypes

![toolshed interface showing some files](../../images/repWithLoc_ss.png)

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:60%&quot;&gt;`tool_data_table_conf.xml.sample`&lt;/span&gt;
```xml
&lt;tables&gt;
	&lt;!-- Locations of indexes in the Bowtie2 mapper format --&gt;
	&lt;table name=&quot;bowtie2_indexes&quot; comment_char=&quot;#&quot;&gt;
		&lt;columns&gt;value, dbkey, name, path&lt;/columns&gt;
		&lt;file path=&quot;tool-data/bowtie2_indices.loc&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/tables&gt;
```
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:60%&quot;&gt;On install, the content of the file and the right
path to the *.loc file is added to `shed_tool_data_table_conf.xml`&lt;/span&gt;

---

## 4. Publishing with Planemo

---

&lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-exclamation-triangle&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;warning&lt;/span&gt; *There are automated ways to publish to a ToolShed using GitHub and Continuous Integration*

[Check out these slides, &quot;Publishing tools&quot; section](/training-material/topics/dev/tutorials/tool-integration/slides.html)

---

### Configure the target Tool Shed

```bash
planemo config_init
```
- Creates `.planemo.yml` file in your home directory:

```yml
## Planemo Global Configuration File.
## Everything in this file is completely optional - these values can all be
## configured via command line options for the corresponding commands.
## [...]
sheds:
     toolshed:
           #key: &quot;&lt;TODO&gt;&quot;
           #email: &quot;&lt;TODO&gt;&quot;
           #password: &quot;&lt;TODO&gt;&quot;
     testtoolshed:
           #key: &quot;&lt;TODO&gt;&quot;
           #email: &quot;&lt;TODO&gt;&quot;
           #password: &quot;&lt;TODO&gt;&quot;
     local:
           #key: &quot;&lt;TODO&gt;&quot;
           #email: &quot;&lt;TODO&gt;&quot;
           #password: &quot;&lt;TODO&gt;&quot;
```

---

### Configure the target Tool Shed

- Add your Tool Shed API key in `.planemo.yml`

```yml
## Planemo Global Configuration File.
## Everything in this file is completely optional - these values can all be
## configured via command line options for the corresponding commands.
## [...]
sheds:
     toolshed:
           key: &quot;xxxxxxxxxmytoolshedAPIkeyxxxxxxx&quot;
           #email: &quot;&lt;TODO&gt;&quot;
           #password: &quot;&lt;TODO&gt;&quot;
     testtoolshed:
           #key: &quot;&lt;TODO&gt;&quot;
           #email: &quot;&lt;TODO&gt;&quot;
           #password: &quot;&lt;TODO&gt;&quot;
     local:
           #key: &quot;&lt;TODO&gt;&quot;
           #email: &quot;&lt;TODO&gt;&quot;
           #password: &quot;&lt;TODO&gt;&quot;
```

---

### Configure repository

```bash
planemo shed_init --name=&quot;tandem_repeats_finder_2&quot;
                     --owner=&quot;gandres&quot;
                     --description=&quot;Tandem Repeats Finder description&quot;
                     --long_description=&quot;A long long description.&quot;
                     --category=&quot;Sequence Analysis&quot;
                     [--remote_repository_url=&lt;URL to .shed.yml on github&gt;]
                     [--homepage_url=&lt;Homepage for tool.&gt;]
```
- Creates `.shed.yml` file in the current repository (tool repository):

```yml
categories: [Sequence Analysis]
description: Tandem Repeats Finder description
long_description: A long long description.
name: tandem_repeats_finder_2
owner: gandres
```

---

### Configure repository

#### Naming conventions
&lt;small&gt;

| Repository Type | Recommended Name         | Examples                 |
| --------------- |--------------------------| -------------------------|
| Data Managers   | `data_manager_$name`     | `data_manager_bowtie2`   |
| Packages        | `package_$name_$version` | `package_aragorn_1_2_36` |
| Tool Suites     | `suite_$name`            | `suite_samtools`         |
| Tools           | `$name`                  | `stringle`, `bowtie2`    |

&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Planemo will determine the repository type based on these conventions&lt;/span&gt;

---

### Configure repository

- Tools and tool suite `.shed.yml`: implicitly define repositories for each individual tool in the directory and build a suite for those tools.

- Example: `trinity/.shed.yml`

```yml
[...]
auto_tool_repositories:
    name_template: &quot;&quot;
    description_template: &quot; (from the Trinity tool suite)&quot;
suite:
    name: &quot;suite_trinity&quot;
    description: Trinity tools to assemble transcript sequences from Illumina RNA-Seq data.
```

---
