class: left, enlarge120

### Example Tool (1 / 2)

From Planemo docs - the following example builds a tool for the `seqtk seq` command.

```sh
$ planemo tool_init --force \
                    --id 'seqtk_seq' \
                    --name 'Convert to FASTA (seqtk)' \
                    --requirement seqtk@1.2 \
                    --example_command 'seqtk seq -a 2.fastq > 2.fasta' \
                    --example_input 2.fastq \
                    --example_output 2.fasta \
                    --test_case \
                    --cite_url 'https://github.com/lh3/seqtk' \
                    --help_from_command 'seqtk seq'
```

Notice the `--requirement seqtk@1.2`.

---

class: left, enlarge120

### Example Tool (2 / 2)

The `--requirement seqtk@1.2` gets translated into the following Galaxy tool XML:

```xml
<requirements>
    <requirement type="package" version="1.2">seqtk</requirement>
</requirements>
```

---

## Dependency Resolution

![](../../images/galaxy_instance.png)

???

- Notice that multiple tools may be mapped to the same requirements and
  any tools may use multiple Conda recipes.
- There are few different ways to populate Applications and Libraries
  on the right - we will talk about Conda which is what we consider the
  "community best practice".

Package, dependency and environment management

---

class: enlarge120

###.image-25[![](../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Conda Terminology

Conda **recipes** build **packages** that are published to **channels**.

---

class: enlarge120

### .image-25[![](../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br /> Conda Key Features for Galaxy

- No compilation at install time - *binaries* with their dependencies, libraries...

- Support for all operating systems Galaxy targets

- Easy to manage *multiple versions* of the same recipe

- HPC-ready: no root privileges needed

- Easy-to-write YAML recipes

- Vibrant Communities

???

- Recipes: independent of the programming language in which software is written
- Support for multiple versions at the same time is needed for reproducibility

Compared with the Tool Shed dependency management (`tool_dependencies.xml`), BioConda is:

- More popular!
- Easier to develop.
- Easier to install and test.

###.image-25[![](../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Conda Distributions

```


```
![](../../images/miniconda_vs_anaconda.png)

---

class: enlarge120

###.image-25[![](../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Best Practice Channels

- Packages through channels within Continuum.

- Conda channels searched by Galaxy for packages
    - iuc
    - bioconda
    - conda-forge
    - defaults

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

.footnote[If you are interested in Natural Language Processing or Cheminformatics you may be asking if these channels can still work for your tools. Despite the name [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) - it is really more about community and a set of best practices than about bioinformatics purity - many diverse packages have been integrated.]

---

class: left, enlarge120

###.image-25[![](../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Install and Configure

```bash
$ planemo conda_init
$ export PATH=$PATH:~/miniconda3/bin
$ which conda
/Users/john/miniconda3/bin/conda
```

Planemo installs Conda using miniconda and configured defaults designed to easy development.

This has already been done on [Planemo machine](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo-machine).

---

class: enlarge120

###.image-25[![](../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Quickstart
#### Using Conda outside Planemo

- Install a package

```bash
$ conda install pyyaml
```

- Install some packages within an isolated environment

```bash
$ conda create -n yaml pyyaml
$ conda env list
yaml        *  ~/miniconda3/envs/yaml
root             ~/miniconda3
$ source activate yaml
(yaml) $
```

---

class: enlarge150

## Conda and Galaxy

Galaxy now automatically installs Conda when first launched and will use [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) and other channels
for package resolution.

---

### Installing Tools with Conda

![](../../images/tool_install.png)

---

### Managing Tool Dependencies

![](../../images/dependency_manage.png)

---

class: enlarge150

## Conda and Planemo

Using Conda directly is generally package-centric, Planemo provides abstractions that are tool-centric.

---

class: left, enlarge120

The next few slides will use the seqtk example from Planemo's documentation - this can be downloaded to
follow along using the following command:

```bash
$ planemo project_init --template=seqtk_complete seqtk_example
$ cd seqtk_example
```

---

class: left

### Linting Conda Dependencies

.enlarge120[Planemo can check if the requirements of a tool are available in best practice Conda channels using the `--conda_requirements` flag of `planemo lint`.]

<br>

```bash
$ planemo lint --conda_requirements seqtk_seq.xml
Linting tool /Users/john/workspace/planemo/docs/writing/seqtk_seq_v6.xml
  ...
Applying linter requirements_in_conda... CHECK
.. INFO: Requirement [seqtk@1.2] matches target in best practice Conda channel [bioconda].
```

<br>

.enlarge120[*Notice Planemo indicates this tool is available and shows the channel it is available in.*]

---

class: left

### The Planemo `conda_install` command


.reduce70[```sh
$ planemo conda_install seqtk_seq.xml
Install conda target CondaTarget[seqtk,version=1.2]
/home/john/miniconda3/bin/conda create -y --name __seqtk@1.2 seqtk=1.2

Fetching packages ...
....
#
# To deactivate this environment, use:
# > source deactivate __seqtk@1.2
#
$ which seqtk
seqtk not found
```]

Notice seqtk hasn't been placed on the `PATH`, an environment has been setup that Galaxy (when
used through Planemo) can leverage.

---

class: enlarge120

### The Planemo `conda_env` command

.reduce70[```sh
$ . <(planemo conda_env seqtk_seq.xml)
Deactivate environment with conda_env_deactivate
(seqtk_seq) $ which seqtk
/home/planemo/miniconda2/envs/jobdepsiJClEUfecc6d406196737781ff4456ec60975c137e04884e4f4b05dc68192f7cec4656/bin/seqtk

         -X INT    mask bases with quality higher than INT [255]
         -n CHAR   masked bases converted to CHAR; 0 for lowercase [0]
         -l INT    number of residues per line; 0 for 2^32-1 [0]

         -V        shift quality by '(-Q) - 33'
         -U        convert all bases to uppercases
         -S        strip of white spaces in sequences
(seqtk_seq) $ conda_env_deactivate
$
```]

---

## Using the Tool Environment

Now that we have verified the Conda environment setup with `conda_install` works properly on the
command-line, we can use our tool!

`planemo test` and `planemo serve` will use this environment by default now for this tool.

---

## Finding the Correct Requirements & Packages

The previous example worked because a published Bioconda recipe named `seqtk` at version `1.2`
was previously published, but how can these be found?

Two easy approaches are using `planemo conda_search` and using the Anaconda web search.

---

class: left

### Using the Planemo `conda_search` Command

The Planemo `conda_search` command is a shortcut around `conda search` that searches best
practice channels that Galaxy is configured to work with:

```sh
$ planemo conda_search seqt
Fetching package metadata ...............
seqtk                        r75                           0  bioconda
                             r82                           0  bioconda
                             r93                           0  bioconda
                             1.2                           0  bioconda
```

Alternatively, `conda` can be used directly:

```sh
$ $HOME/miniconda3/bin/conda search -c iuc -c bioconda -c conda-forge seqtk
```

---

### Using Anaconda Search - https://anaconda.org

![](../../images/anaconda_result.png)

???

Notice that only one of these results is a best practice channel and so that is the
only one that will be used by Galaxy by default.

### <i class="fa fa-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></i> Hands-on

![](../../images/exercise.png)

---

### <i class="fa fa-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></i> Hands-on

#### The Goal
- Find the correct package and version for a tool in a best practice channel.
- Add a requirement to a tool to allow Galaxy to find, install, and use a Conda package.

---

### <i class="fa fa-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></i> Hands-on

#### Steps

1. Run the following commands to download an example tool to modify.
```sh
$ planemo project_init --template conda_exercises conda_exercises
$ cd conda_exercises/exercise1
$ ls
pear.xml              test-data
```
2. Run `planemo test pear.xml` to verify the tool does not function without dependencies defined.
3. Use `--conda_requirements` flag with `planemo lint` to verify it does indeed lack requirements.
4. Use `planemo conda_search` or the [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) website to search for the correct package and version in a best practice channel.
5. Update pear.xml with the correct requirement tags.
6. Re-run the `lint` command from above to verify the tool now has the correct dependency definition.
7. Re-run the `test` command from above to verify the tool test now works properly.

###.image-25[![](../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Writing a Conda Recipe

If searching best practice channels fails, you may need to build a Conda recipe.

###.image-25[![](../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Writing a Conda Recipe - The Files

A Conda recipe is defined by a directory, the two most important files in this directory are:

- `meta.yaml`: contains all the metadata of the recipe
- `build.sh`: the Unix script that installs the files

---

class: left

###.image-25[![](../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Writing a Conda Recipe - `meta.yaml`

`meta.yaml` contains basic metadata about the recipe.

```yaml

  license: MIT
  summary: The BWA read mapper.

class: left

###.image-25[![](../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Writing a Conda Recipe - Tests

<br/>
<br/>

`meta.yaml` should contain simple tests. These are commands executed at the end of `conda build` and expected to return `0` on success.


```yaml
test:
  commands:
    - bowtie2 --version
```

```yaml
test:
  commands:
    - bwa 2>&1 | grep 'index sequences in the'
```

```yaml
test:
  commands:
    - '$R -e "library(''xcms'')"'
```

Please note that the Conda tests run inside the runtime environment and not in the build environment.

.footnote[.center[https://conda.io/docs/building/meta-yaml.html#test-section ]]

---

From Bioconda Guidelines:

> An adequate test must be included in the recipe. An "adequate" test depends on the recipe, but must be able to detect a successful installation. While many packages may ship their own test suite (unit tests or otherwise), including these in the recipe is not recommended since it may timeout the build system on CircleCI. We especially want to avoid including any kind of test data in the repository.

<small>
- `$PREFIX` is a variable defined by conda when building the package.
- `$PREFIX` usually contains `bin/`, `lib/`, and `include/` that are filled with the package files.
- `$PREFIX` will be loaded in the user environment at runtime: `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `PYTHONPATH`, ...

###.image-25[![](../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Writing a Conda Recipe - Building

Once the recipe is ready to go, the `conda build` command can be used to build it.

```bash
$ $HOME/miniconda3/bin/conda build .
```

1. BUILD START: Builds/Compiles the package
2. BUILD START: Provides a .tar.bz2
3. TEST START: Installs the .tar.bz2 previously generated
4. TEST START: Launches the functional tests
5. (Provides the .tar.bz2 path)

### Planemo and `--conda_use_local`

By default, Galaxy and Planemo will ignore locally built packages.

Simply pass `--conda_use_local` to various Planemo commands (e.g. `test`, `conda_install`, or `serve`) to use the local package
cache.

*Enables developing Galaxy tools and Conda recipes in parallel.*

---

### <i class="fa fa-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></i> Hands-on

#### The Goal
- Implement and test a local Conda recipe.
- Use Planemo and Galaxy with a locally built package.

---

class: left

### <i class="fa fa-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></i> Hands-on

#### Before

If you have completed `exercise1`, open `exercise2`.

```sh
$ cd ../exercise2
$ ls
fleeqtk_seq.xml              test-data
```

This directory contains the outline of a tool for [fleeqtk](https://github.com/jmchilton/fleeqtk). fleeqtk is a fork of the project seqtk that many Planemo tutorials are built around and the example tool `fleeqtk_seq.xml` should be fairly familiar.

---

class: left

### <i class="fa fa-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></i> Hands-on

#### Steps

1. Clone and branch Bioconda (https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes)
2. Build a recipe for fleeqtk version 1.3. You may wish to use conda skeleton, start from scratch, or copy the recipe of seqtk and work from there - any of these strategies should work
  * fleeqtk 1.3 can be downloaded using the URL https://github.com/jmchilton/fleeqtk/archive/v1.3.tar.gz
  * fleeqtk can be built using `make` and installed with `make install`
3. Use `conda build` to build the recipe
4. Add a `requirement` for this new package in the example tool.
5. Run `planemo conda_install --conda_use_local fleeqtk_seq.xml` to install the package for Galaxy
6. Run `planemo test fleeqtk_seq.xml` to verify the tool and package work together

## Pinning Libraries - Use jinja

> If your package links dynamically against a particular library, it is **often necessary to pin the version against which it was compiled, in order to avoid ABI incompatibilities**. Instead of hardcoding a particular version in the recipe, we use jinja templates to achieve this. This **helps ensure that all bioconda packages are binary-compatible with each other**. For example, bioconda provides an environment variable `CONDA_ZLIB` that contains the current major version of Zlib.


```yaml
{% raw %}
requirements:
  build:
    - zlib {{ CONDA_ZLIB }}*
  run:
    - zlib {{ CONDA_ZLIB }}*
{% endraw %}
```

## Stable URLs

```yaml
source:

  url: https://github.com/lh3/bwa/archive/v0.7.15.tar.gz
  md5: 54fdee953c5c256d36885a1c5c6b118c
```

> While supported by Conda, `git_url` and `git_rev` are not as stable as a git tarball. Ideally a github repo should have tagged releases that are accessible as tarballs from the “releases” section of the github repo. In addition tarballs can be easily mirrored and Bioconda is saving a copy of every tarball so the recipe can be rebuild at any time.

---

class: left

## Python

For PyPI packages

```sh
conda skeleton pypi <package_name>
```

- Builds likely correct `build.sh` and `meta.yaml`.
- The test automatically added is probably sufficient for library, may need to write extra tests for command-line tools.
- Recipes requiring `python` should build on Python 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6 by default, preprocessing selectors can be used with `build: skip` to skip targets.

## R

For CRAN packages

```sh
conda skeleton cran <packagename>
```

- Builds likely correct `build.sh` and `meta.yaml`.
- The recipe name will have an `r-` prefix and will be converted to lowercase.
- Typically can be used without modification, though dependencies may also need recipes.

## Java

- New recipes should use the `openjdk` package from [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/openjdk-feedstock).
- Add a wrapper script if the software is typically called via `java -jar`.
- JAR files should go in `$PREFIX/share/$PKG_NAME-$PKG_VERSION-$PKG_BUILDNUM`
- A wrapper script should be placed here as well, and symlinked to $PREFIX/bin.

## Metapackages

> Metapackages tie together other packages. All they do is define dependencies. For example, the hubward-all metapackage specifies the various other conda packages needed to get full hubward installation running just by installing one package.

> Other metapackages might tie together conda packages with a theme. For example, all UCSC utilities related to bigBed files, or a set of packages useful for variant calling.
