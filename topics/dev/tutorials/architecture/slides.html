---

### Branches

![Branches](../../images/core_branches.plantuml.svg)

---

class: enlarge150

### Committers &amp; Open Goverance

All repository goverance is done in the open on GitHub via Pull Requests and voting. Galaxy goes beyond open source to open goverance.

&gt; &quot;The committers group is the group of trusted developers and advocates who manage the core Galaxy code base.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Galaxy Project committers are the only individuals who may commit to the core Galaxy code base.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Committers may participate in all formal votes, including votes to modify team membership, merge pull requests, and modify [policies].&quot;

---

class: enlarge150

### Working Groups

https://galaxyproject.org/community/wg/

&gt; &quot;Galaxy has grown a lot over the years, going from a project at one university in 2005 to the global community it is today. Several parts of the Galaxy ecosystem have become avowedly and obviously community driven during that time, including tools, code, training, and several other international efforts. Galaxy Working Groups push this global model to other areas of Galaxy as well.&quot;

---

class: enlarge200

### Code of Conduct (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

Describes expectations, encourages diversity, and describes how to report issues such as unacceptable behavior.

Check out the full policy in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

---

class: enlarge150

### Release Process

New large releases are issued roughly every 4 months. The process is guided by an auto-created
self documenting release issue.

Check out the [20.05 release issue](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/issues/9636) as an example.

---

class: enlarge150

### Organizing Issues and Pull Requests

Extensive use of Github tags are used to try to organize the numerous issues and
pull requests of the Galaxy repository.

The tags are described in detail in [issues.rst](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/doc/source/project/issues.rst).

---

### Continuous Integration (CI)

![Galaxy CI](../../images/core_ci.png)

If you get Red Xs - take a second to ponder whether they make sense and don't be afraid to ask, it is a complex system with a lot of noise!

---

### Linting and Code Formatting

Part of the Galaxy CI process includes linting both the backend Python and frontend ES 6 code.
This linting process captures many common problems as well as enforcing a common code style.

The output reports from the CI process are relatively straightforward, but it is a good process
to lint changes before opening pull requests for them. The Python linter can be run using `tox`
as follows.

```
$ tox -e lint
```

The client code formatting guidelines are much more strict but as a result can be applied
automatically for very consistent code. Execute the `client-format` make command to format
the code and then the `client-lint` command to check the result.

```
$ make client-format
$ make client-lint
```

---

### mypy and Python Types

Starting with release 21.01, we are experimenting with adding type annotations to our Python
code. We are not enforcing typing for imported library code and [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) does a fair job inferring
types in most situations, so this process should be relatively transparent to contributors.

If there are problems with typing, the CI should produce fairly explicit output about how to
correct problems. These problems generally just require a single type annotation - feel free
to request help on a pull request for what that should look like.

To run a subset of the python type checking locally, `tox` again can be used:

```
$ tox -e mypy
```

A quick overview about why one might want to add type annotation to Python code and how to use
them can be found on this [blog post](https://dev.to/dstarner/using-pythons-type-annotations-4cfe).
Additional useful resources include [this cheat sheet from mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html)
and the Python docs for the [typing module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).

### Development Environments

Galaxy developers use a wide range of IDEs and we don't offer any formal recommendation of one over another.

However, Marius has assembled some documentation on debugging the [Galaxy server](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/dev/debugging_galaxy.html) and [tests](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/dev/debugging_tests.html) using VS Code.

All these documents as well as versions code and deployment documentation and release notes
can be found at docs.galaxyproject.org.

## Principles

*The guiding principles of the core code architecture.*

---

### Aspirational Principles of Galaxy Architecture

Whereas the architecture of the frontend (Web UI) aims for consistency and is
highly opinionated, the backend (Python server) is guided by flexibility and is meant to be driven by plugins whenever possible.

???

Though an imperfect abstraction... maybe it is beneficial to think of the organizational
principles that guide frontend and backend development of Galaxy as
diametrically opposite.

The frontend architecture is guided by the principle that the end user experience
should be as simple and consistent as possible. The backend has been deployed at
so many different sites and targeting so many different technologies - that
flexibility is paramount.

---

### An Opinionated Frontend

- The target audience is a *bench scientist* - no knowledge of programming, paths, or command lines should be assumed.
- Consistent colors, fonts, themes, etc...
- Reusable components for presenting common widgets - from the generic (forms and grids) to the specific (tools and histories).
- Tied to specific technologies:
  - Implemented in JavaScript (ES6)
  - Built with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
  - [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for component definitions

---

### A Plugin Driven Backend

Galaxy's backend is in many ways driven by *pluggable interfaces* and
can be adapted to many different technologies.

- SQLAlchemy allows using SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL (sort of) for your database.
- Many different cluster backends or job managers are supported.
- Different frontend proxies (e.g. nginx) are supported as well as web
  application containers (e.g. uWSGI).
- Different storage strategies and technologies are supported (e.g. S3, iRODS).
- Tool definitions, job metrics, stat middleware, tool dependency resolution, workflow modules,
  datatype definitions are all plugin driven.

???

If the chief architectural principle guiding the frontend is a fast and accessible
experience for the bench scientist, perhaps for the backend it is allowing
deployment on many different platforms and a different scales.

---

### A Plugin Driven Backend but...

Galaxy has long been guided by the principle that cloning it and calling
the `run.sh` should &quot;just work&quot; and should work quickly.

So by default Galaxy does not require:

 - Compilation - it fetches *binary wheels* for your platform.
 - A job manager - Galaxy can act as one.
 - An external database server - Galaxy can use an sqlite database.
 - A web proxy or external Python web server.

---

### In other words...

The Galaxy frontend is architected with the bench scientist in mind first and foremost,
the Galaxy backend is architected with Galaxy administrators in mind first and foremost.

![Two Views of Galaxy Python Project](../../images/core_files_code_python_2_views.plantuml.svg)

`lib` contains a single monolithic view of the `galaxy` namespace.

Each sub-directory of `packages` contains a logical subset of this `galaxy` namespace. Directory symbolic links are used to ensure the same files are used.

???

TODO: a slide before this one describing Python modules and how they map to files
using galaxy.util, galaxy.model.mapping, and galaxy.web.framework.

![Client-Server Communications](../../images/server_client_vuejs.plantuml.svg)

Bits and pieces of older client technologies appear throughout - ranging from Python
mako templates to generate HTML, lower-level jQuery, and lots of Backbone legacy MVC.

---

![Processing requests on the server](../../images/wsgi_app.plantuml.svg)

Expanding the right side of that diagram. We will move through the component left to right.

---

### WSGI

- Python interface for web servers defined by PEP 333 - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/.
- Galaxy tends to favor uWSGI, but other options such as Gunicorn and Paste can be used to host the application.
  - https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/ (a million bells and whistles, highly performant, a bit brittle)
  - https://gunicorn.org/ (simpler, more standard Python 3 WSGI server)
  - https://bitbucket.org/ianb/paste (more of legacy interest, but still heavily used in testing for instance)

---

![Processing requests on the server](../../images/wsgi_app.plantuml.svg)

---

template: left-aligned

### WSGI Middleware

A WSGI function:

`def app(environ, start_response):`

- Middleware act as filters, modify the `environ` and then pass through to the next webapp
- Galaxy uses several middleware components defined in the `wrap_in_middleware`
  function of `galaxy.webapps.galaxy.buildapp`.

---

template: left-aligned

### Galaxy's WSGI Middleware

Middleware configured in `galaxy.webapps.galaxy.buildapp#wrap_in_middleware`.

- `paste.httpexceptions#make_middleware`
- `galaxy.web.framework.middleware.remoteuser#RemoteUser` (if configured)
- `paste.recursive#RecursiveMiddleware`
- `galaxy.web.framework.middleware.sentry#Sentry` (if configured)
- Various debugging middleware (linting, interactive exceptions, etc...)
- `galaxy.web.framework.middleware.statsd#StatsdMiddleware` (if configured)
- `galaxy.web.framework.middleware.xforwardedhost#XForwardedHostMiddleware`
- `galaxy.web.framework.middleware.request_id#RequestIDMiddleware`

### Instances

![webapp](../../images/webapp.plantuml.svg)

---

template: left-aligned

### Routes

Setup on `webapp` in `galaxy.webapps.galaxy.buildapp.py`.

```python
webapp.add_route(
    '/datasets/:dataset_id/display/{filename:.+?}',
    controller='dataset', action='display',
    dataset_id=None, filename=None
)
```

URL `/datasets/278043/display` matches this route, so `handle_request` will

- lookup the controller named “dataset”
- look for a method named “display” that is exposed
- call it, passing dataset_id and filename as keyword arg

Uses popular Routes library (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Routes).

---

template: left-aligned

Simplified `handle_request` from `lib/galaxy/web/framework/base.py`.

```python
def handle_request(self, environ, start_response):
    path_info = environ.get( 'PATH_INFO', '' )
    map = self.mapper.match( path_info, environ )
    if path_info.startswith('/api'):
        controllers = self.api_controllers
    else:
        controllers = self.controllers

### Why not just Django?

We do build on many of the same standards, concepts, and libraries - the entire stack isn't custom code but there is a non-trivial web framework defined in &quot;Galaxy&quot;.

The Galaxy community likes Django and uses it to build newer webapps, Galaxy simply predates it and has evolved its own framework.

---

class: enlarge150

### API Controllers

- `lib/galaxy/webapps/galaxy/controllers/api/`
- Exposed method take `trans` and request parameters and return a JSON response.
- Ideally these are *thin*
  - Focused on &quot;web things&quot; - adapting parameters and responses and move
    &quot;business logic&quot; to components not bound to web functionality.

---

class: enlarge150

### Legacy Controllers

- `lib/galaxy/webapps/galaxy/controllers/`
- Return arbitrary content - JSON, HTML, etc...
- Render HTML components using [mako](http://www.makotemplates.org/) templates (see `templates/`)
- The usage of these should continue to decrease over time.

## Application Components - Models and Managers

*The architecture surrounding Galaxy components.*

---

![This section will talk about that manager layer and what lies below](../../images/wsgi_app.plantuml.svg)

---

The are many of ways to describe and visualize the Galaxy server architecture,
one is to imagine the Galaxy database as the ultimate source for Galaxy &quot;stuff&quot;
and the API controllers as the ultimate sink.

In this architecture imagining of Galaxy, managers are the layer meant to
mediate all controller interactions (and isolate the backend from the web
framework) while the model layer is meant to mediate all database interactions
(and isolate the backend from database internals).

---

![Models and Managers](../../images/core_models_managers.plantuml.svg)

---

### Managers

High-level business logic that ties all of these components together.

Controllers should ideally be thin wrappers around actions defined in managers.

Whenever a model requires more than just the database, the operation should be defined
in a manager instead of in the model.

---

### Managers - Some Key Files

![Key Managers](../../images/core_files_managers.plantuml.svg)

---

### Managers - Some Helpers

![Manager Helpers](../../images/core_files_managers_helpers.plantuml.svg)

---

### Galaxy Models

- Database interactions powered by SQLAlchemy - https://www.sqlalchemy.org/.
- Galaxy doesn't think in terms &quot;rows&quot; but &quot;objects&quot;.
- Classes for Galaxy model objects in `lib/galaxy/model/__init__.py`.
- Classes mapped to tables in `lib/galaxy/model/mapping.py`
  - Describes table definitions and relationships.

---

![SQLAlchemy Architecture](../../images/sqla_arch_small.png)

---

### Galaxy Model Migrations

- A migration describes a linear list of database &quot;diff&quot;s to
  end up with the current Galaxy model.
- Allow the schema to be migrated forward automatically.
- Powered by sqlalchemy-migrate - https://sqlalchemy-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
- Each file in `lib/galaxy/model/migrate/versions/`
  - `0124_job_state_history.py`
  - `0125_workflow_step_tracking.py`
  - `0126_password_reset.py`

### A Little About Jobs

- Job is placed into the database and picked up by the job handler.
- Job handler (`JobHandler`) watches the job and transitions job's state - common startup and finishing.
- Job mapper (`JobRunnerMapper`) decides the &quot;destination&quot; for a job.
- Job runner (e.g. `DrammaJobRunner`) actual runs the job and provides an interface for checking status.

### Visualization Plugins

Adding new visualizations to a Galaxy instance

- Configuration file (XML)
- Base template (Mako or JavaScript)
- Additional static data if needed (CSS, JS, …)

### Visualization Examples

All in `config/plugins/visualizations`:

- `chiraviz` - Latest addition mid-2020, demonstrates current state of the art building and packing. [#9562](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/9562)
- `csg` - Chemical structure viewer
- `graphviz` - Visualize graph data using [cytoscape.js](http://www.cytoscape.org/)
- `charts` - Classic charts as well as some integrated BioJS visualizations
- `trackster` - Genome browser, deeply tied to Galaxy internals.

---

### Data Providers

Provide efficient access to data for viz &amp; API

Framework provides direct link to read the raw dataset
or use data providers to adapt it

In config, assert that visualization requires a given type of data providers

Data providers process data before sending to browser - slice, filter, reformat, ...

---

### Interactive Environments

Similar to visualizations: config and template

Within the base template, launch a Docker container running a web accessible
process

Build a UI that accesses that process through a proxy

## Client Architecture

*The architecture of Galaxy's web user interface.*

---

template: left-aligned

### Client Directories

- Source stylesheets and JavaScript (ES6) in `client/galaxy/{style|scripts}`
- &quot;Packed&quot; bundles served by Galaxy stored in `static/dist`
  - `run.sh` uses `git diff` to try to determine if client needs to be built before starting Galaxy
  - webpack builds these &quot;compiled&quot; artifacts

Upshot - to develop against the client, modify files in `client/` and rebuild with `make client` before
deployment.

---

class: normal

### Building the Client - Makefile Targets

```Makefile
client: node-deps ## Rebuild all client-side artifacts (for local dev)
  cd client &amp;&amp; yarn run build

client-production-maps: node-deps ## Build optimized artifacts with sourcemaps.
  cd client &amp;&amp; yarn run build-production-maps

client-watch: node-deps ## Rebuild client on each change.
  cd client &amp;&amp; yarn run watch

client-format: node-deps ## Reformat client code
  cd client &amp;&amp; yarn run prettier

client-eslint: node-deps # Run client linting
  cd client &amp;&amp; yarn run eslint

client-test: node-deps  ## Run JS unit tests via Karma
  cd client &amp;&amp; yarn run test

node-deps: ## Install NodeJS and dependencies.
```

![What is Webpack](../../images/what-is-webpack.svg)

---

class: enlarge150

### webpack in Galaxy

Packs and &quot;transpiles&quot; Galaxy ES6 code (.js), Galaxy Vue modules (.vue), libraries from npm, scss stylesheets (.scss) into browser native bundles.

Hundreds of high-level well organized files into optimized single files that can be quickly downloaded.

Lots of active development and complexity around Viz plugins and dependencies for instance, but the webpack configuration file in `config/webpack.config.js` is fairly straightforward.

---

class: white
![Webpack in Action](../../images/jsload.png)

---

### Stylesheets

- Galaxy stylesheets are generally defined using the SCSS syntax
- SCSS is a high-level superset of CSS - https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax
- `sass` is leveraged by webpack to convert these styles to native CSS at client build time
- Rebuild style with `make style`
- Galaxy's SCSS files can be found in `client/galaxy/style/scss/`

## Dependencies

---

template: left-aligned

### Dependencies - Python

`script/common_startup.sh` sets up a `virtualenv` with required dependencies in `$GALAXY_ROOT/.venv` (or `$GALAXY_VIRTUAL_ENV` if set).

- Check for existing virtual environment, if it doesn't exist check for `virtualenv`.
- If `virtualenv` exists, use it. Otherwise download it as a script and setup a virtual environment using it.
- `. &quot;$GALAXY_VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate&quot;`
- Upgrade to latest `pip` to allow use of binary wheels.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt --index-url https://wheels.galaxyproject.org/simple`
- Install dozens of dependencies.

---

template: left-aligned

### Dependencies - JavaScript

- Dependencies are defined in `client/package.json`.
- These are fetched from npm and compiled into bundles as part of `make client` and related `Makefile` targets.

### postgres

- Database server can scale way beyond default sqlite
- https://www.postgresql.org/
- github.com/galaxyproject/usegalaxy-playbook -&gt; `roles/galaxyprojectdotorg.postgresql`

---

### nginx (or Apache)

- Optimized servers for static content
- https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/
- github.com/galaxyproject/usegalaxy-playbook -&gt; `templates/nginx/usegalaxy.j2`

---

### Multi-processes

Threads in Python are limited by the [GIL](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock).

Running multiple processes of Galaxy and seperate processes for web handling
and job processing works around this.

This used to be an important detail - but uWSGI makes things a lot easier.

---

### Legacy Client Architecture

???

Still some backbone and templates here and there, might be better to drop though?

---

![Client-Server Communications](../../images/server_client.plantuml.svg)

???

Workflow, Data Libraries, Visualization, History, Tool Menu,
Many Grids, User and preference management.

### &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-key&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;keypoints&lt;/span&gt; Key points


- Galaxy runs out of the box and fetches all needed dependencies.

- Running Galaxy in production requires configuration.

- The architecture is designed to be pluggable and extensible.

- Learn more about different Galaxy aspects in our [development section](/topics/dev/).
