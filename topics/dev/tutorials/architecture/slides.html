### Contributing Quick Start

Contribution guidelines: https://bit.ly/gx-CONTRIBUTING-md

---

class: enlarge200

### Pull Requests

Nearly all changes should come in through GitHub Pull Requests.

The exceptions include security patches, packaging and release process artifacts, and backporting fixes to older releases.

---

class: enlarge150

### Security (SECURITY_POLICY.md)

In brief, to responsibly report security issues e-mail

[`galaxy-committers@lists.galaxyproject.org`](mailto:galaxy-committers@lists.galaxyproject.org)

Check out the full policy in [SECURITY_POLICY.md](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/SECURITY_POLICY.md).

---

### Branches

![Branches](../../images/core_branches.plantuml.svg)

---

class: enlarge150

### Committers &amp; Open Goverance

All repository goverance is done in the open on GitHub via Pull Requests and voting. Galaxy goes beyond open source to open goverance.

&gt; &quot;The committers group is the group of trusted developers and advocates who manage the core Galaxy code base.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Galaxy Project committers are the only individuals who may commit to the core Galaxy code base.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Committers may participate in all formal votes, including votes to modify team membership, merge pull requests, and modify [policies].&quot;

---

class: enlarge150

### Working Groups

https://galaxyproject.org/community/wg/

&gt; &quot;Galaxy has grown a lot over the years, going from a project at one university in 2005 to the global community it is today. Several parts of the Galaxy ecosystem have become avowedly and obviously community driven during that time, including tools, code, training, and several other international efforts. Galaxy Working Groups push this global model to other areas of Galaxy as well.&quot;

---

class: enlarge200

### Code of Conduct (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

Describes expectations, encourages diversity, and describes how to report issues such as unacceptable behavior.

Check out the full policy in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

---

class: enlarge150

### Release Process

New large releases are issued roughly every 4 months. The process is guided by an auto-created
self documenting release issue.

Check out the [21.05 release issue](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/issues/11770) as an example.

Working groups create roadmaps aligned with each release and coordinated with project leadership.

---

class: enlarge150

### Organizing Issues and Pull Requests

Extensive use of Github tags are used to try to organize the numerous issues and
pull requests of the Galaxy repository.

The tags are described in detail in [issues.rst](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/doc/source/project/issues.rst).

---

### Continuous Integration (CI)

![Galaxy CI](../../images/core_ci.png)

If you get Red Xs - take a second to ponder whether they make sense and don't be afraid to ask, it is a complex system with a lot of noise!

---

### Linting and Code Formatting

Part of the Galaxy CI process includes linting both the backend Python and frontend ES 6 code.
This linting process captures many common problems as well as enforcing a common code style.

The output reports from the CI process are relatively straightforward, but it is a good process
to lint changes before opening pull requests for them. The Python linter can be run using `tox`
as follows.

```
$ tox -e lint
```

The client code formatting guidelines are much more strict but as a result can be applied
automatically for very consistent code. Execute the `client-format` make command to format
the code and then the `client-lint` command to check the result.

```
$ make client-format
$ make client-lint
```

---

### mypy and Python Types

Starting with release 21.01, portions of the Galaxy backend have
Python 3 type annotations and static checking is performed as part of
CI. Imported library types are not enforcing and
[mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) does a fair job
inferring types in most situations, so this process should be
relatively transparent to contributors.

If there are problems with typing, the CI produces explicit output
about how to correct problems. These problems generally just require a
single type annotation. Feel free to request help on a pull request
for what that should look like.

To run a subset of the python type checking locally, `tox` again can
be used:

```
$ tox -e mypy
```

A quick overview about why to add type annotations to Python code and how to use
them can be found on this [blog post](https://dev.to/dstarner/using-pythons-type-annotations-4cfe).
Additional useful resources include [this cheat sheet from mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html)
and the Python docs for the [typing module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).

### Development Environments

Galaxy developers use a wide range of IDEs and we don't offer any formal recommendation of one over another.

However, Marius has assembled some documentation on debugging the [Galaxy server](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/dev/debugging_galaxy.html) and [tests](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/dev/debugging_tests.html) using VS Code.

---

### Development Environment - Gitpod

Galaxy does have a Gitpod configuration that is enabled to allow editing and testing PRs https://www.gitpod.io/.

Video from Marius presenting Gitpod at the Galaxy Developer Roundtable (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e71DFg3gsw#t=39m0s)

### docs.galaxyproject.org

![docs.galaxyproject.org](../../images/core_docs.png)

All these documents as well as versions code and deployment documentation and release notes
can be found at [docs.galaxyproject.org](https://docs.galaxyproject.org).

---

## Principles

*The guiding principles of the core code architecture.*

---

### Aspirational Principles of Galaxy Architecture

Whereas the architecture of the frontend (Web UI) aims for consistency and is
highly opinionated, the backend (Python server) is guided by flexibility and is meant to be driven by plugins whenever possible.

???

Though an imperfect abstraction... maybe it is beneficial to think of the organizational
principles that guide frontend and backend development of Galaxy as
diametrically opposite.

The frontend architecture is guided by the principle that the end user experience
should be as simple and consistent as possible. The backend has been deployed at
so many different sites and targeting so many different technologies - that
flexibility is paramount.

---

### An Opinionated Frontend

- The target audience is a *bench scientist* - no knowledge of programming, paths, or command lines should be assumed.
- Consistent colors, fonts, themes, etc...
- Reusable components for presenting common widgets - from the generic (forms and grids) to the specific (tools and histories).
- Tied to specific technologies:
  - Implemented in JavaScript (ES6)
  - Built with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
  - [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for component definitions

---

### A Plugin Driven Backend

Galaxy's backend is in many ways driven by *pluggable interfaces* and
can be adapted to many different technologies.

- SQLAlchemy allows using SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL (sort of) for your database.
- Many different cluster backends or job managers are supported.
- Different frontend proxies (e.g. nginx) are supported as well as web
  application containers (e.g. uWSGI, gunicorn).
- Different storage strategies and technologies are supported (e.g. S3, iRODS).
- Tool definitions, job metrics, stat middleware, tool dependency resolution, workflow modules,
  datatype definitions are all plugin driven.

???

If the chief architectural principle guiding the frontend is a fast and accessible
experience for the bench scientist, perhaps for the backend it is allowing
deployment on many different platforms and a different scales.

---

### A Plugin Driven Backend but...

Galaxy has long been guided by the principle that cloning it and calling
the `run.sh` should &quot;just work&quot; and should work quickly.

So by default Galaxy does not require:

 - Compilation - it fetches *binary wheels* for your platform.
 - A job manager - Galaxy can act as one.
 - An external database server - Galaxy can use an sqlite database.
 - A web proxy or external Python web server.

---

class: enlarge200

### In other words...

The Galaxy frontend is architected with the bench scientist in mind first and foremost,
the Galaxy backend is architected with Galaxy administrators in mind first and foremost.

Bits and pieces of older client technologies appear throughout - ranging from Python
mako templates to generate HTML, lower-level jQuery, and lots of Backbone legacy MVC.

### ASGI - Application

Spiritual successor to
[WSGI](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/). An ASGI application
is an async callable that takes in a `scope` (`dict` describing the
connection), `send` (an async callable to respond to events via),
and `receive` (an async callable to receive messages).

```python
async def application(scope, receive, send):
    event = await receive()
    ...
    await send({&quot;type&quot;: &quot;http.response.body&quot;, ...})
```

Checkout [ASGI documentation](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/) for more details.

### ASGI &amp; Starlette Low-level Example

We will talk a lot about Galaxy and FastAPI - but much of its
plumbing is just aliases for starlette ASGI handling.

```python
from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse

async def app(scope, receive, send):
    assert scope['type'] == &quot;http&quot;
    response = PlainTextResponse('Hello, world!')
    await response(scope, receive, send)
```

If this is placed in a file called `example.py` with Starlette on
the Python path, the application server uvicorn can then host this
application with the following shell command:

```
$ uvicorn example:app
INFO: Started server process [11509]
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Example from [starlette.io](https://www.starlette.io/).

### ASGI - Starlette High-level Example

Building a higher-level `example.py` with Starlette.


```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.responses import JSONResponse
from starlette.routing import Route


async def homepage(request):
    return JSONResponse({'hello': 'world'})


app = Starlette(debug=True, routes=[
    Route('/', homepage),
])
```

A small framework for building web applications.

### ASGI - FastAPI

From https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/master/fastapi/applications.py

```python
...
from starlette.applications import Starlette
...

class FastAPI(Starlette):
    ...
```

FastAPI (the library and the application base) extends starlette framework with features for building APIs. These include data
validation, serialization, documentation generation.

### FastAPI `__call__`

https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/master/fastapi/applications.py

```python
async def __call__(self, scope: Scope, receive: Receive, send: Send) -&gt; None:
    if self.root_path:
        scope[&quot;root_path&quot;] = self.root_path
    if AsyncExitStack:
        async with AsyncExitStack() as stack:
             scope[&quot;fastapi_astack&quot;] = stack
             await super().__call__(scope, receive, send)
    else:
        await super().__call__(scope, receive, send)  # pragma: no cover
```

A light wrapper around Starlette's call entry point.

---

template: left-aligned

### Starlette `__call__`

https://github.com/encode/starlette/blob/master/starlette/applications.py

```python
async def __call__(self, scope: Scope, receive: Receive, send: Send) -&gt; None:
   scope[&quot;app&quot;] = self
   await self.middleware_stack(scope, receive, send)
```

Walks through Starlette middleware.

---

template: left-aligned

### Starlette `build_middleware_stack`

https://github.com/encode/starlette/blob/master/starlette/applications.py

```python
def build_middleware_stack(self) -&gt; ASGIApp:
    ...

    app = self.router
    for cls, options in reversed(middleware):
        app = cls(app=app, **options)
    return app
```

Start with the router and surround it with each layer of configured middleware.

---

template: left-aligned
class: enlarge150

### ASGI Middleware

&gt; It is possible to have ASGI “middleware” - code that plays the role of both server and application, taking in a scope and the send/receive awaitable callables, potentially modifying them, and then calling an inner application.

https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specs/main.html#middleware

---

template: left-aligned
class: enlarge150

### Starlette Middleware

&gt; Starlette includes several middleware classes for adding behavior that is applied across your entire application. These are all implemented as standard ASGI middleware classes, and can be applied either to Starlette or to any other ASGI application.

https://www.starlette.io/middleware/

### Starlette `build_middleware_stack`

https://github.com/encode/starlette/blob/master/starlette/applications.py

```python
def build_middleware_stack(self) -&gt; ASGIApp:
    ...

    app = self.router
    for cls, options in reversed(middleware):
        app = cls(app=app, **options)
    return app
```

Notice the inner most layer is the router.

### FastAPI Router Initialization

https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/master/fastapi/applications.py

```python
class FastAPI(Starlette):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        self.router: routing.APIRouter = routing.APIRouter(
            routes=routes,
        )
```

---

### FastAPI Router

```python
from starlette import routing

class APIRouter(routing.Router):
   ...
```

---

### Starlette Router

https://github.com/encode/starlette/blob/master/starlette/routing.py

```python
async def __call__(self, scope: Scope, receive: Receive, send: Send) -&gt; None:
   ...
   for route in self.routes:
       # Determine if any route matches the incoming scope,
       # and hand over to the matching route if found.
       match, child_scope = route.matches(scope)
       if match == Match.FULL:
           scope.update(child_scope)
           await route.handle(scope, receive, send)
           return
       ...

class: enlarge200

In order to understand how the routing classes are setup within Galaxy,
lets step back and look really quickly at how Galaxy's FastAPI
application (ASGI endpoint) is constructed.

---

### FastAPI Factory

`lib/galaxy/webapps/galaxy/fast_factory.py`

```python
def factory():
    props = WebappSetupProps(
        app_name='galaxy',
        default_section_name=DEFAULT_CONFIG_SECTION,
        env_config_file='GALAXY_CONFIG_FILE',
        env_config_section='GALAXY_CONFIG_SECTION',
        check_galaxy_root=True
    )
    config_provider = WebappConfigResolver(props)
    config = config_provider.resolve_config()
    gx_webapp, gx_app = app_pair(
        global_conf=config.global_conf,
        load_app_kwds=config.load_app_kwds,
        wsgi_preflight=config.wsgi_preflight
    )
    return initialize_fast_app(gx_webapp, gx_app)
```

---

### FastAPI Application

`lib/galaxy/webapps/galaxy/fast_app.py`

```python
def initialize_fast_app(gx_webapp, gx_app):
    app = FastAPI(
        title=&quot;Galaxy API&quot;,
        docs_url=&quot;/api/docs&quot;,
        openapi_tags=api_tags_metadata,
    )
    add_exception_handler(app)
    add_galaxy_middleware(app, gx_app)
    add_request_id_middleware(app)
    include_all_package_routers(app, 'galaxy.webapps.galaxy.api')
    wsgi_handler = WSGIMiddleware(gx_webapp)
    app.mount('/', wsgi_handler)
    return app
```

---

### Finding API Routers

Following this line:

`include_all_package_routers(app, 'galaxy.webapps.galaxy.api')`

to the file

`lib/galaxy/webapps/base/api.py`

```python
def include_all_package_routers(app: FastAPI, package_name: str):
    for _, module in walk_controller_modules(package_name):
        router = getattr(module, &quot;router&quot;, None)
        if router:
            app.include_router(router)
```

---

class: reduce70

### Routing inside the Application

```python
router = Router(tags=['tags'])


@router.cbv
class FastAPITags:
    manager: TagsManager = depends(TagsManager)

    @router.put(
        '/api/tags',
        summary=&quot;Apply a new set of tags to an item.&quot;,
        status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT,
    )
    def update(
        self,
        trans: ProvidesUserContext = DependsOnTrans,
        payload: ItemTagsPayload = Body(
            ...,  # Required
            title=&quot;Payload&quot;,
            description=&quot;Request body containing the item and the tags to be assigned.&quot;,
        ),
    ):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Replaces the tags associated with an item with the new ones specified in the payload.

        - The previous tags will be __deleted__.
        - If no tags are provided in the request body, the currently associated tags will also be __deleted__.
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        self.manager.update(trans, payload)
```

### WSGI Fallback

Back to `initialize_fast_app`, two of the final lines were as follows:

```python
wsgi_handler = WSGIMiddleware(gx_webapp)
app.mount('/', wsgi_handler)
```

This effectively provides a fallback to our legacy WSGI application.

---

### WSGI

- Python interface for web servers defined by PEP 333 - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/.
- Galaxy tends to favor uWSGI, but other options such as Gunicorn and Paste can be used to host the application.
  - https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/ (a million bells and whistles, highly performant, a bit brittle)
  - https://gunicorn.org/ (simpler, more standard Python 3 WSGI server)
  - https://bitbucket.org/ianb/paste (more of legacy interest, but still heavily used in testing for instance)

---

### WSGI Middleware

A WSGI function:

`def app(environ, start_response):`

- Middleware act as filters, modify the `environ` and then pass through to the next webapp
- Galaxy uses several middleware components defined in the `wrap_in_middleware`
  function of `galaxy.webapps.galaxy.buildapp`.

---

template: left-aligned

### Galaxy's WSGI Middleware

Middleware configured in `galaxy.webapps.galaxy.buildapp#wrap_in_middleware`.

- `paste.httpexceptions#make_middleware`
- `galaxy.web.framework.middleware.remoteuser#RemoteUser` (if configured)
- `paste.recursive#RecursiveMiddleware`
- `galaxy.web.framework.middleware.sentry#Sentry` (if configured)
- Various debugging middleware (linting, interactive exceptions, etc...)
- `galaxy.web.framework.middleware.statsd#StatsdMiddleware` (if configured)
- `galaxy.web.framework.middleware.xforwardedhost#XForwardedHostMiddleware`
- `galaxy.web.framework.middleware.request_id#RequestIDMiddleware`

### Routes

Setup on `webapp` in `galaxy.webapps.galaxy.buildapp.py`.

```python
webapp.add_route(
    '/datasets/:dataset_id/display/{filename:.+?}',
    controller='dataset', action='display',
    dataset_id=None, filename=None
)
```

URL `/datasets/278043/display` matches this route, so `handle_request` will

- lookup the controller named “dataset”
- look for a method named “display” that is exposed
- call it, passing dataset_id and filename as keyword arg

Uses popular Routes library (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Routes).

---

template: left-aligned

Simplified `handle_request` from `lib/galaxy/web/framework/base.py`.

```python
def handle_request(self, environ, start_response):
    path_info = environ.get( 'PATH_INFO', '' )
    map = self.mapper.match( path_info, environ )
    if path_info.startswith('/api'):
        controllers = self.api_controllers
    else:
        controllers = self.controllers

    trans = self.transaction_factory( environ )

    controller_name = map.pop( 'controller', None )
    controller = controllers.get( controller_name, None )

    # Resolve action method on controller
    action = map.pop( 'action', 'index' )
    method = getattr( controller, action, None )

    kwargs = trans.request.params.mixed()
    # Read controller arguments from mapper match
    kwargs.update( map )

    body = method( trans, **kwargs )
    # Body may be a file, string, etc... respond with it.
```

### Controllers

Three varieties

1. FastAPI ASGI API controllers
2. WSGI API controllers
3. Legacy WSGI web controllers.

Ideally each of these are *thin*. Focused on &quot;web things&quot; - adapting parameters and responses and move
&quot;business logic&quot; to components not bound to web functionality.

---

class: enlarge150

### FastAPI Controllers

- Found in `lib/galaxy/webapps/galaxy/controllers/api/`.
- Consume and produce typed data using Python 3 type annotations, FastAPI helpers, and Pydantic models.
- Router specifies HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, etc..) and how to parse path.

---

class: reduce70

### FastAPI Controller Example

`lib/galaxy/webapps/galaxy/controllers/api/roles.py`

```python
@router.cbv
class FastAPIRoles:
    role_manager: RoleManager = depends(RoleManager)

    @router.get('/api/roles')
    def index(self, trans: ProvidesUserContext = DependsOnTrans) -&gt; RoleListModel:
        roles = self.role_manager.list_displayable_roles(trans)
        return RoleListModel(__root__=[role_to_model(trans, r) for r in roles])

    @router.get('/api/roles/{id}')
    def show(self, id: EncodedDatabaseIdField, trans: ProvidesUserContext = DependsOnTrans) -&gt; RoleModel:
        role_id = trans.app.security.decode_id(id)
        role = self.role_manager.get(trans, role_id)
        return role_to_model(trans, role)

    @router.post(&quot;/api/roles&quot;, require_admin=True)
    def create(self, trans: ProvidesUserContext = DependsOnTrans, role_definition_model: RoleDefinitionModel = Body(...)) -&gt; RoleModel:
        role = self.role_manager.create_role(trans, role_definition_model)
        return role_to_model(trans, role)
```

---

class: reduce70

### FastAPI and Pydantic

```python
RoleIdField = Field(title=&quot;ID&quot;, description=&quot;Encoded ID of the role&quot;)
RoleNameField = Field(title=&quot;Name&quot;, description=&quot;Name of the role&quot;)
RoleDescriptionField = Field(title=&quot;Description&quot;, description=&quot;Description of the role&quot;)


class BasicRoleModel(BaseModel):
    id: EncodedDatabaseIdField = RoleIdField
    name: str = RoleNameField
    type: str = Field(title=&quot;Type&quot;, description=&quot;Type or category of the role&quot;)


class RoleModel(BasicRoleModel):
    description: str = RoleDescriptionField
    url: str = Field(title=&quot;URL&quot;, description=&quot;URL for the role&quot;)
    model_class: str = Field(title=&quot;Model class&quot;, description=&quot;Database model class (Role)&quot;)


class RoleDefinitionModel(BaseModel):
    name: str = RoleNameField
    description: str = RoleDescriptionField
    user_ids: Optional[List[EncodedDatabaseIdField]] = Field(title=&quot;User IDs&quot;, default=[])
    group_ids: Optional[List[EncodedDatabaseIdField]] = Field(title=&quot;Group IDs&quot;, default=[])
```

### WSGI API Controllers

- Also in `lib/galaxy/webapps/galaxy/controllers/api/`
- Mirroring FastAPI controllers until FastAPI required (likely 21.09)
- Exposed method take `trans` and request parameters and return a JSON response (possibly including Pydantic objects)

---

class: reduce70

### WSGI API Controller Example

`lib/galaxy/webapps/galaxy/controllers/api/roles.py`

```python
class RoleAPIController(BaseGalaxyAPIController):
    role_manager: RoleManager = depends(RoleManager)

    @web.expose_api
    def index(self, trans: ProvidesUserContext, **kwd):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        GET /api/roles
        Displays a collection (list) of roles.
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        roles = self.role_manager.list_displayable_roles(trans)
        return RoleListModel(__root__=[role_to_model(trans, r) for r in roles])

    @web.expose_api
    def show(self, trans: ProvidesUserContext, id: str, **kwd):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        GET /api/roles/{encoded_role_id}
        Displays information about a role.
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        role_id = decode_id(self.app, id)
        role = self.role_manager.get(trans, role_id)
        return role_to_model(trans, role)

    @web.expose_api
    @web.require_admin
    def create(self, trans: ProvidesUserContext, payload, **kwd):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        POST /api/roles
        Creates a new role.
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        expand_json_keys(payload, [&quot;user_ids&quot;, &quot;group_ids&quot;])
        role_definition_model = RoleDefinitionModel(**payload)
        role = self.role_manager.create_role(trans, role_definition_model)
        return role_to_model(trans, role)
```

---

class: enlarge150

### Legacy WSGI Controllers

- `lib/galaxy/webapps/galaxy/controllers/`
- Return arbitrary content - JSON, HTML, etc...
- Render HTML components using [mako](http://www.makotemplates.org/) templates (see `templates/`)
- The usage of these should continue to decrease over time.

---

## `app` and Dependency Injection

*The architecture of connecting Galaxy components.*

---

![Big Interconnected App Python 2](../../images/app_py2.plantuml.svg)

---

### A God object

&gt; &quot;a God object is an object that knows too much or does too much. The God object is an example of an anti-pattern and a code smell.&quot;

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object

Not only does `app` know and do too much, it is also used way too many places. Every interesting component, every controller, the web transaction, etc.. has a reference to `app`.

---

### A Typical Usage

```python
class DatasetCollectionManager:

     def __init__(self, app):
        self.type_registry = DATASET_COLLECTION_TYPES_REGISTRY
        self.collection_type_descriptions = COLLECTION_TYPE_DESCRIPTION_FACTORY
        self.model = app.model
        self.security = app.security

        self.hda_manager = hdas.HDAManager(app)
        self.history_manager = histories.HistoryManager(app)
        self.tag_handler = tags.GalaxyTagHandler(app.model.context)
        self.ldda_manager = lddas.LDDAManager(app)
```

---

![Big Interconnected App Python 3 - no right](../../images/app_types_no_interface.plantuml.svg)

---

## Problematic Dependency Graph

```python
class DatasetCollectionManager:

     def __init__(self, app: UniverseApplication):
        self.type_registry = DATASET_COLLECTION_TYPES_REGISTRY
        self.collection_type_descriptions = COLLECTION_TYPE_DESCRIPTION_FACTORY
        self.model = app.model
        self.security = app.security

        self.hda_manager = hdas.HDAManager(app)
        self.history_manager = histories.HistoryManager(app)
        self.tag_handler = tags.GalaxyTagHandler(app.model.context)
        self.ldda_manager = lddas.LDDAManager(app)
```

`UniverseApplication` creates a `DatasetCollectionManager` for the application and `DatasetCollectionManager` imports and annotates
the `UniverseApplication` as a requirement. This creates an unfortunate dependency loop.

**Dependencies should form a DAG (directed acyclic graph)**.

---

![Big Interconnected App with Python 3 Types](../../images/app_types.plantuml.svg)

---

## Why an Interface?

Dependencies now closer to a DAG - `DatasetCollectionManager` no longer annotated with the type `UniverseApplication`! Imports are cleaner.

---

## Benefits of Typing

```python
class DatasetCollectionManager:

     def __init__(self, app: StructuredApp):
        self.type_registry = DATASET_COLLECTION_TYPES_REGISTRY
        self.collection_type_descriptions = COLLECTION_TYPE_DESCRIPTION_FACTORY
        self.model = app.model
        self.security = app.security

        self.hda_manager = hdas.HDAManager(app)
        self.history_manager = histories.HistoryManager(app)
        self.tag_handler = tags.GalaxyTagHandler(app.model.context)
        self.ldda_manager = lddas.LDDAManager(app)
```

- mypy provides robust type checking.
- IDE can provide hints to make developing this class and usage of this class easier.

### Design Problems with Handling Dependencies Directly

Using app to construct a manager for dealing with dataset collections.

```python
class DatasetCollectionManager:

     def __init__(self, app: StructuredApp):
        self.type_registry = DATASET_COLLECTION_TYPES_REGISTRY
        self.collection_type_descriptions = COLLECTION_TYPE_DESCRIPTION_FACTORY
        self.model = app.model
        self.security = app.security

        self.hda_manager = hdas.HDAManager(app)
        self.history_manager = histories.HistoryManager(app)
        self.tag_handler = tags.GalaxyTagHandler(app.model.context)
        self.ldda_manager = lddas.LDDAManager(app)
```

- DatasetCollectionManager needs to know how to construct all the other managers it is using, not just their interface.
- `app` has a instance of this class and `app` is used to construct and instance of this class - this circular dependency
  chain results in brittleness and complexity in how to construct `app`.
- `app` is very big and we're depending on a lot of it but not a large percent it. This makes typing less than ideal.

### Testing Problems with Handling Dependencies Directly

```python
class DatasetCollectionManager:

     def __init__(self, app: StructuredApp):
        self.type_registry = DATASET_COLLECTION_TYPES_REGISTRY
        self.collection_type_descriptions = COLLECTION_TYPE_DESCRIPTION_FACTORY
        self.model = app.model
        self.security = app.security

        self.hda_manager = hdas.HDAManager(app)
        self.history_manager = histories.HistoryManager(app)
        self.tag_handler = tags.GalaxyTagHandler(app.model.context)
        self.ldda_manager = lddas.LDDAManager(app)
```

- Difficult to unit test properly
  - What parts of app are being used?
  - How do we construct a smaller app with just those pieces?
  - How do we stub out classes cleanly when we're creating the dependent objects internally.

        self.security = security

        self.hda_manager = hda_manager
        self.history_manager = history_manager
        self.tag_handler = tag_handler
        self.ldda_manager = ldda_manager
```]

- We're no longer depending on `app`.
- The type signature very clearly delineates what dependencies are required.
- Unit testing can inject precise dependencies supplying only the behavior needed.

---

### Constructing the Object Is Still Brittle

```python
DatasetCollectionManager(
    self.model,
    self.security,
    HDAManager(self),
    HistoryManager(self),
    GalaxyTagHandler(self.model.context),
    LDDAManager(self)
)
```

- The complexity in ordering of construction of `app` is still challenging.
- The constructing code of this object still needs to know how to construct each dependency of the object.
- The constructing code of this object needs to explicitly import all the types.

### What is Type-based Dependency Injection?

A dependency injection **container** keeps tracks of singletons or recipes for how to construct each type. By
default when it goes to construct an object, it can just ask the container for each dependency based on the
type signature of the class being constructed.

If an object declares it consumes a dependency of type `X` (e.g. `HDAManager`), just query the container
recursively for an object of type `X`.

---

### What happens to object construction?

Once all the dependencies have been type annotated properly and the needed singletons have been configured.

```python
dcm = DatasetCollectionManager(
    self.model,
    self.security,
    HDAManager(self),
    HistoryManager(self),
    GalaxyTagHandler(self.model.context),
    LDDAManager(self)
)
```

becomes

```python
dcm = container[DatasetCollectionManager]
```

### Picking a Library

Many of the existing DI libraries for Python predate widespread Python 3 and don't readily infer things based on types.
The benefits of typing and DI are both enhanced by the other - so it was important to pick one that could do type-based
injection.

We went with Lagom, but we've built abstractions that would make it very easy to switch.

---

### Lagom

![Lagom Website](../../images/lagom_ss.png)

https://lagom-di.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

---

### DI and Controllers - FastAPI

FastAPI controllers allowed some basic dependency injection.

```python
def get_tags_manager() -&gt; TagsManager:
    return TagsManager()


@cbv(router)
class FastAPITags:
    manager: TagsManager = Depends(get_tags_manager)
    ...
```

Dependency injection allows for type checking but doesn't use type inference (requires factory functions, etc..)

https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/

---

### DI and Controllers - FastAPI Limitations

Also we have two different controller styles and only the new FastAPI allowed dependency injection.

```python
def get_tags_manager() -&gt; TagsManager:
    return TagsManager()


@cbv(router)
class FastAPITags:
    manager: TagsManager = Depends(get_tags_manager)
    ...

class TagsController(BaseAPIController):

    def __init__(self, app):
        super().__init__(app)
        self.manager = TagsManager()
```

---

class: reduce90

### DI and Controllers - Unified Approach

```diff
-def get_tags_manager() -&gt; TagsManager:
-    return TagsManager()

-

 class FastAPITags:
-    manager: TagsManager = Depends(get_tags_manager)

-        super().__init__(app)
-        self.manager = TagsManager()
+class TagsController(BaseGalaxyAPIController):
+    manager: TagsManager = depends(TagsManager)
```

Building dependency injection into our application and not relying on FastAPI allows for dependency injection that is *less verbose*, available uniformly across the application,
*works for the legacy controllers identically*.

### DI and Tasks - Framework

From `lib/galaxy/celery/tasks.py`

```python
from lagom import magic_bind_to_container
...

def galaxy_task(func):
    CELERY_TASKS.append(func.__name__)
    app = get_galaxy_app()
    if app:
        return magic_bind_to_container(app)(func)
    return func
```

`magic_bind_to_container` to binds function parameters to a specified Lagom DI container automatically.

---

### DI and Tasks - Examples

From `lib/galaxy/celery/tasks.py`

```python
@celery_app.task(ignore_result=True)
@galaxy_task
def purge_hda(hda_manager: HDAManager, hda_id):
    hda = hda_manager.by_id(hda_id)
    hda_manager._purge(hda)


@celery_app.task
@galaxy_task
def set_metadata(hda_manager: HDAManager, ldda_manager: LDDAManager, dataset_id, model_class='HistoryDatasetAssociation'):
    if model_class == 'HistoryDatasetAssociation':
        dataset = hda_manager.by_id(dataset_id)
    elif model_class == 'LibraryDatasetDatasetAssociation':
        dataset = ldda_manager.by_id(dataset_id)
    dataset.datatype.set_meta(dataset)
```

### Tips for Designing New Galaxy Backend Components

- Consume only the related components you need to avoid `app` when possible.
- Annotate inputs to the component with Python types.
- Use interface types to shield consumers from implementation details.
- Rely on Galaxy's dependency injection to construct the component and provide it to consumers.

## Application Components - Models and Managers

*The architecture surrounding Galaxy components.*

---

![This section will talk about that manager layer and what lies below](../../images/wsgi_app.plantuml.svg)

---

There are many ways to describe and visualize the Galaxy server architecture,
one is to imagine the Galaxy database as the ultimate source for Galaxy &quot;stuff&quot;
and the API controllers as the ultimate sink.

In this architecture imagining of Galaxy, managers are the layer meant to
mediate all controller interactions (and isolate the backend from the web
framework) while the model layer is meant to mediate all database interactions
(and isolate the backend from database internals).

---

![Models and Managers](../../images/core_models_managers.plantuml.svg)

---

### Managers

High-level business logic that ties all of these components together.

Controllers should ideally be thin wrappers around actions defined in managers.

Whenever a model requires more than just the database, the operation should be defined
in a manager instead of in the model.

---

### Managers - Some Key Files

![Key Managers](../../images/core_files_managers.plantuml.svg)

---

### Managers - Some Helpers

![Manager Helpers](../../images/core_files_managers_helpers.plantuml.svg)

---

### Galaxy Models

- Database interactions powered by SQLAlchemy - https://www.sqlalchemy.org/.
- Galaxy doesn't think in terms of &quot;rows&quot; but &quot;objects&quot;.
- Classes for Galaxy model objects in `lib/galaxy/model/__init__.py`.
- Classes mapped to tables in `lib/galaxy/model/mapping.py`
  - Describes table definitions and relationships.

---

![SQLAlchemy Architecture](../../images/sqla_arch_small.png)

---

### Galaxy Model Migrations

- A migration describes a linear list of database &quot;diff&quot;s to
  end up with the current Galaxy model.
- Allow the schema to be migrated forward automatically.
- Powered by sqlalchemy-migrate - https://sqlalchemy-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
- Each file in `lib/galaxy/model/migrate/versions/`
  - `0124_job_state_history.py`
  - `0125_workflow_step_tracking.py`
  - `0126_password_reset.py`

### A Little About Jobs

- Job is placed into the database and picked up by the job handler.
- Job handler (`JobHandler`) watches the job and transitions job's state - common startup and finishing.
- Job mapper (`JobRunnerMapper`) decides the &quot;destination&quot; for a job.
- Job runner (e.g. `DrammaJobRunner`) actual runs the job and provides an interface for checking status.

### Visualization Plugins

Adding new visualizations to a Galaxy instance

- Configuration file (XML)
- Base template (Mako or JavaScript)
- Additional static data if needed (CSS, JS, …)

### Visualization Examples

All in `config/plugins/visualizations`:

- `chiraviz` - Latest addition mid-2020, demonstrates current state of the art building and packing. [#9562](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/9562)
- `csg` - Chemical structure viewer
- `graphviz` - Visualize graph data using [cytoscape.js](http://www.cytoscape.org/)
- `charts` - Classic charts as well as some integrated BioJS visualizations
- `trackster` - Genome browser, deeply tied to Galaxy internals.

---

### Data Providers

Provide efficient access to data for viz &amp; API

Framework provides direct link to read the raw dataset
or use data providers to adapt it

In config, assert that visualization requires a given type of data providers

Data providers process data before sending to browser - slice, filter, reformat, ...

---

### Interactive Environments

Similar to visualizations: config and template

Within the base template, launch a Docker container running a web accessible
process

Build a UI that accesses that process through a proxy

---

![File Source Plugins](../../images/core_file_sources.plantuml.svg)

---

# FileSources vs ObjectStores

ObjectStores provide datasets not files, the files are organized logically in a very flat way around a dataset.

FilesSources instead provide files and directories, not datasets. A FilesSource is meant to be browsed in hierarchical fashion - and also has no concept of extra files, etc..
The former is assumed to be persistent, the latter makes no such assumption.

## Client Architecture

*The architecture of Galaxy's web user interface.*

---

template: left-aligned

### Client Directories

- Source JavaScript for the client is in `client/src`.
- Source stylesheets are in `client/src/style`.
- &quot;Packed&quot; bundles served by Galaxy stored in `static/dist`
  - `run.sh` uses `git diff` to try to determine if client needs to be built before starting Galaxy
  - webpack builds these &quot;compiled&quot; artifacts

Upshot - to develop against the client, modify files in `client/` and rebuild with `make client` before
deployment.

---

class: normal

### Building the Client - Makefile Targets

```Makefile
client: node-deps ## Rebuild all client-side artifacts (for local dev)
  cd client &amp;&amp; yarn run build

client-production-maps: node-deps ## Build optimized artifacts with sourcemaps.
  cd client &amp;&amp; yarn run build-production-maps

client-watch: node-deps ## Rebuild client on each change.
  cd client &amp;&amp; yarn run watch

client-format: node-deps ## Reformat client code
  cd client &amp;&amp; yarn run prettier

client-lint: client-eslint client-format-check ## ES lint and check format of client

client-test: node-deps  ## Run JS unit tests
  cd client &amp;&amp; yarn run test

client-test-watch: client ## Watch and run all client unit tests on changes
  cd client &amp;&amp; yarn run jest-watch

node-deps: ## Install NodeJS and dependencies.
```

---

### Automatically Reloading During Development

The following command rebuilds the application on each change.

```
make client-watch
```

This is still a relatively slow process, an extra client development server can be started that proxies non-client requests
to your Galaxy server and selectively reloads only what is needed during active development (hot module replacement or HMR).

```
make client-dev-server
```

Make sure to open Galaxy at http://localhost:8081 instead to point at the client proxy.

![What is Webpack](../../images/what-is-webpack.svg)

---

class: enlarge150

### webpack in Galaxy

Packs and &quot;transpiles&quot; Galaxy ES6 code (.js), Galaxy Vue modules (.vue), libraries from npm, scss stylesheets (.scss) into browser native bundles.

Hundreds of high-level well organized files into optimized single files that can be quickly downloaded.

Lots of active development and complexity around Viz plugins and dependencies for instance, but the webpack configuration file in `config/webpack.config.js` is fairly straightforward.

---

class: white
![Webpack in Action](../../images/jsload.png)

---

### Stylesheets

- Galaxy shared stylesheets are generally defined using the SCSS syntax
- SCSS is a high-level superset of CSS - https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax
- `sass` is leveraged by webpack to convert these styles to native CSS at client build time
- Rebuild style with `make style`
- Galaxy's SCSS files can be found in `client/src/style/scss/`

---

### Package and Build Files

![Client Build Files](../../images/core_files_client_build.plantuml.svg)

---

### Source Files

![Client Build Files](../../images/core_files_client_sources.plantuml.svg)

---

### ES6

The client is built from JavaScript source files. We use ES6 JavaScript.

A tutorial to help learn JavaScript generally might be https://www.w3schools.com/js/.

For someone familiar with JavaScript but that wants a primer on the new language features in ES6,
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp may be more appropriate.

---

### Vue

Vue.js is a reactive framework for building web client applications.

We chose Vue.js over React initially because of its focus on allowing developers to incrementally or progressively replace pieces of complex existing applications.

The idea behind Vue.js is fairly simple to pick up and there is a lot of great tutorials and videos available. https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/ is a really good jumping off point.

---

### Vuex

&gt; Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion.

https://vuex.vuejs.org/

---

### Client Unit Tests

https://jestjs.io/

Configured in `client/src/jest/jest.config.js`.

Vue tests are placed beside components in `client/src`, more tests in `client/test/qunit/tests` and `client/test/jest/standalone/`.

---

### Vue Test Utils

&gt; Vue Test Utils is the official unit testing utility library for Vue.js.

https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/

Really nice reference library documentation. A lot of helpers and concepts to unit test Vue components.

---

### Client Unit Test Design Tips

https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/tree/dev/client/docs/src/component-design/unit-testing

- Clearly document the intent of your test
- Implement logic in pure functions when possible
- Wrap native browser resources in a function so they can be easily mocked

---

### Webhooks in Galaxy

Webhooks is a system in Galaxy which can be used to write small JS and/or Python functions to change predefined locations in the Galaxy client.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In short: A plugin infrastructure for the Galaxy UI

## Dependencies

---

template: left-aligned

### Dependencies - Python

`script/common_startup.sh` sets up a `virtualenv` with required dependencies in `$GALAXY_ROOT/.venv` (or `$GALAXY_VIRTUAL_ENV` if set).

- Check for existing virtual environment, if it doesn't exist check for `virtualenv`.
- If `virtualenv` exists, use it. Otherwise download it as a script and setup a virtual environment using it.
- `. &quot;$GALAXY_VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate&quot;`
- Upgrade to latest `pip` to allow use of binary wheels.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt --index-url https://wheels.galaxyproject.org/simple`
- Install dozens of dependencies.

---

template: left-aligned

### Dependencies - JavaScript

- Dependencies are defined in `client/package.json`.
- These are fetched from npm and compiled into bundles as part of `make client` and related `Makefile` targets.

### postgres

- Database server can scale way beyond default sqlite
- https://www.postgresql.org/
- github.com/galaxyproject/usegalaxy-playbook -&gt; `roles/galaxyprojectdotorg.postgresql`

---

### nginx (or Apache)

- Optimized servers for static content
- https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/
- github.com/galaxyproject/usegalaxy-playbook -&gt; `templates/nginx/usegalaxy.j2`

---

### Multi-processes

Threads in Python are limited by the [GIL](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock).

Running multiple processes of Galaxy and seperate processes for web handling
and job processing works around this.

This used to be an important detail - but uWSGI makes things a lot easier.

### Legacy Client Architecture

???

Still some backbone and templates here and there, might be better to drop though?

---

![Client-Server Communications](../../images/server_client.plantuml.svg)

???

Workflow, Data Libraries, Visualization, History, Tool Menu,
Many Grids, User and preference management.

### Why not just Django?

We do build on many of the same standards, concepts, and libraries - the entire stack isn't custom code but there is a non-trivial web framework defined in &quot;Galaxy&quot;.

The Galaxy community likes Django and uses it to build newer webapps, Galaxy simply predates it and has evolved its own framework.

### &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-key&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;keypoints&lt;/span&gt; Key points


- Galaxy runs out of the box and fetches all needed dependencies.

- Running Galaxy in production requires configuration.

- The architecture is designed to be pluggable and extensible.

- Learn more about different Galaxy aspects in our [development section](/topics/dev/).
