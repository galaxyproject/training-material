## Galaxy API

- **Application Programming Interface (API)**: the protocol defined by a software for how it can be controlled by an external program
- Galaxy provides a rich API:
  - Over the HTTP protocol
  - The Galaxy UI is being migrated on top of the Galaxy API

???

The server providing the API becomes the program, and the URLs become the commands - all through the medium of the HTTP protocol.

---

## Interacting with Galaxy: UI vs. API

- The Galaxy UI is good for:
  - exploring and visualizing data
  - experimenting
  - graphically designing workflows
  - people not comfortable with command line

- The Galaxy API is good for:
  - interact programmatically with the server
    - complex control: **branching** and **looping** (not possible in workflows)
  - automate repetitive tasks
  - integration with external resources

???

The API allows you to use Galaxy's capabilities programmatically:
- run a workflow over each file in a directory
- run a second workflow only if the first passes some QA threshold
- upload a FASTQ file when the sequencer finishes writing it.

Additionally, the features that make Galaxy great are still applied when using the API:
- histories still capture the exact steps of your experiments and reproducibility is maintained
- jobs and compute resources are still managed for you
- datasets and metadata persist and are centralized
- your work is still sharable.

It's also worth noting that all the work you did via the API is still accessible and modifiable when you return to the UI.

---

## Galaxy API functionalities

- Users can:
  - manage histories and datasets
  - upload and download data
  - run tools and workflows, ...

- Admins can also manage:
  - data libraries
  - Tool Shed repositories
  - users, quotas, roles...

- Source code lives at https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/tree/dev/lib/galaxy/webapps/galaxy/api/

???

Admin examples:
- upload files and start a workflow when new files are added to a directory on the server
- automatically create libraries for new users
- replicate the set of tools installed on another server
- automatically assign users to the right group according to email domain

---

## RESTful API

.left[REpresentational State Transfer (REST) is the architectural style of the World Wide Web:]
- client–server
- stateless: no client context stored on the server between requests
- cacheable by client
- Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)
- JSON media type
- standard HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) and status codes

???

A common way to construct an API command is to view it as a simple (imperative) sentence: `<verb> <a resource>`
- Examples of resources for the Galaxy API are: datasets, tools, jobs, histories, libraries, users... - essentially anything in Galaxy that is recorded in the database.
- The HTTP verbs are GET (i.e. retrieve), POST (create), PUT (replace), DELETE, PATCH (partially modify). There are others but they don't apply (yet). These are [HTTP request methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods).
  - GET calls should produce no side effects.
  - PUT and DELETE should be idempotent, i.e. should produce the same result no matter how many times they are repeated.
- Often additional options and parameters must be passed to specify how the command should take place.

---

## Resources, URIs, and parameters

- API call: **HTTP method + URI [+ payload]**

  - `GET https://usegalaxy.org/api/histories?order=name` -> ordered list of histories
  - `POST /api/histories {"name": "New"}` -> create a history named "New"
  - `PUT /api/histories/<id> {"published": true}` -> publish a history
  - `DELETE /api/histories/<history_id>/contents/<id>` -> delete a history dataset

- URI parameters: ids in path, others in the *query* (`?name=value&...`)
- POST/PUT payload as JSON

---

## JSON format

.left[JavaScript Object Notation https://www.json.org/] <img style="float: right;" height="80" width="80" alt="JSON logo" src="../../images/json160.gif" />
  - Lightweight data-interchange text format
  - Easy to read/write for both humans and machines
  - ECMA-404 open standard (2013), [RFC 8259](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259) (2017)

```json
{"history_id": "b5731bb49a17bf50",
 "id": "df06cc665d85b6ea",
 "inputs": {"0": {"id": "bbd44e69cb8906b51528b5d606d1fdd0",
                  "src": "hda"}},
 "model_class": "WorkflowInvocation",
 "outputs": ["bbd44e69cb8906b528819eaaff340ecd",
             "0ff30b4e2a4bed9e"],
 "state": "scheduled",
 "update_time": "2015-07-03T19:28:39.544574",
 "workflow_id": "56482e194d798eb6"}
```

???

Data returned from (and in some cases passed to) the Galaxy API is often described or formatted in JSON.

---

## Status codes and errors

- HTTP status codes:
  - 200 OK, 400 your error, 500 server error, ...<br>
    https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml
- Galaxy error codes and messages: [`lib/galaxy/exceptions/`](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/tree/dev/lib/galaxy/exceptions)
  - Still a work in progress

---

## How to access a REST API

.left[With anything that can communicate over HTTP:]
- Command line:
  - `wget`: only GET
  - `curl`: all methods
- GUI:
  - Browsers: only GET
  - [RESTClient](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/restclient/) add-on for Firefox
  - [Advanced REST Client](https://advancedrestclient.com/)
- Software libraries:
  - General HTTP libraries (e.g. *requests* for Python)
  - Service-specific libraries (e.g. *BioBlend* to access Galaxy using Python)

---

## Security

- Most API calls require authentication
  - When the UI accesses the API, session auth is used
  - Other callers needs an **API key**: alphanumeric string (32 chars) identifying a registered user<br>
    Keep it secure, it’s the same as a username+password!
- Always use HTTPS:
  - **https**://localhost?key=foo is safer due to the encryption of the transmitted data

---

## Advanced Galaxy API config

.left[Options in `config/galaxy.yml`:]
- User impersonation by adding `run_as` in the payload
  ```yaml
  # Optional list of email addresses of API users who can make calls on
  # behalf of other users.
  api_allow_run_as: foo@foo.com
  ```

- Bootstrapping Galaxy

  ```yaml
  # Master key that allows many API admin actions to be used without
  # actually having a defined admin user in the database/config.  Only
  # set this if you need to bootstrap Galaxy, you probably do not want
  # to set this on public servers.
  master_api_key: MASTERLOCK
  ```

---

## Galaxy API pros and cons

- Pros:
  - Distributed with Galaxy
  - Well tested
  - Language agnostic
- Cons:
  - Very low-level

---

## Tutorials - part 1

Now it's a good time to try BioBlend! We have prepared
[some tutorials](https://github.com/nsoranzo/bioblend-tutorial/) as Jupyter
notebooks, which can be executed online with Binder at
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nsoranzo/bioblend-tutorial/master

Walk-throughs:
- `galaxy_api_histories.ipynb`: interact with histories using the **Galaxy API**
- `bioblend_histories.ipynb`: interact with histories using **BioBlend**

Exercises:
- `ex1_galaxy_api.ipynb`: launch a workflow using the **Galaxy API**
- `ex1_bioblend.ipynb`: launch a workflow using **BioBlend**

---

## BioBlend limitations

- Python-only (but separate *blend4j* and *blend4php* exist)
- Its methods just deserialize the JSON response
  - No isolation from changes in the Galaxy API
  - Need to extract the entity id for further processing
- No explicit modeling of Galaxy entities and their relationships
- Complex operations still need many function calls
  - Need for higher-level functionality

---

## BioBlend.objects

- BioBlend.objects is an extra layer which adds an **object-oriented interface** for the Galaxy API
- Started by Simone Leo, Luca Pireddu and Nicola Soranzo at CRS4 in 2013
- Distributed with BioBlend
- Presently limited to datasets, histories, jobs, libraries, tools and workflows

---

## Tutorials - part 2

Walk-throughs:
- `bioblend.objects_histories.ipynb`: interact with histories using **BioBlend.objects**

Exercises:
- `ex1_bioblend.objects.ipynb`: launch a workflow using **BioBlend.objects**

## Before we start
1. Get your Galaxy API key:
   1. In your browser, open your Galaxy homepage (e.g. https://usegalaxy.org/ )
   2. Log in, or create an account if you don't have one yet
   3. Go to `User -> Preferences` in the top menu bar, then click on `Manage API key`
   4. If there is no current API key available, click on `Create a new key` to generate it
   5. Copy your API key to somewhere convenient, you will need it throughout this tutorial

2. Install the tools and workflow on your Galaxy:
	1. The tools:  Click on the Admin tab
		* In the Tools and Tool Shed category, click on the line **Search Tool Shed**
		* Select the **"Galaxy Main Tool Shed"**, and the **"Browse valid repositories"** line
		* Search and install *bam_to_sam* from devteam and *samtools_sort* from IUC owner
	2. Launch IPython on a terminal

---

## Connect with Galaxy using IPython:

* Import the GalaxyInstance object from BioBlend module:

  ```python
  from bioblend.galaxy import GalaxyInstance
  ```

* Create your GalaxyInstance instance object using your Galaxy URL and API key

  ```python
  gi = GalaxyInstance(url="http://localhost:8080", key="your key")
  ```

#### Why IPython:
* Automatic completion, e.g. type *gi.* and then press the `Tab` key

* To better understand BioBlend methods and classes, you can use `help(command), object?, object??`

---

## Access BioBlend documentation

* Let's look at the help for the **run_tool** method:
  ```python
  help(gi.tools.run_tool)
  ```
* The help should tell you that `run_tool` needs 3 inputs:
  1. A *history_id*, where the input data is and where the output data will be
  2. A *tool_id*, which will tell Galaxy which tool to execute
  3. *tool_inputs*, a dictionary storing the data used to run the tool

---

class: top

## Tools Object (1/4)

* Get the samtools sort tool id

  ```python
  list_tool = gi.tools.get_tools(name='sort')
  ```

---

## Tools Object (2/4)

* The dictionary `tool_inputs` is needed to run a tool

* It is a Python dictionary defined by specific methods from the `bioblend.galaxy.tools.inputs` class

  ```python
  from bioblend.galaxy.tools.inputs import inputs
  ```

* The `inputs` method instantiates a class called `InputsBuilder`:

  ```python
  help(inputs)
  ```

* Each input from the tool XML needs to be defined using the methods `set_param` or `set_dataset_param` from the `InputsBuilder` class
==> If the input format is "data", the method to use is `set_dataset_param`

* Here is an example:

  ```python
  myinputs = inputs().set_param("param1", 'value')
        .set_dataset_param("data1", 'dataset_id', src="hda")
  ```

**To run the tool samtools sort, we need more information on the tool itself**

---

class: top
## Tools Object (3/4)

* Get the details on the "samtool sort" tool

  ```python
  detail_tool = gi.tools.show_tool(list_tool[0]['id'], io_details=True)
  ```

--

```python
detail_tool['inputs']
[{u'argument': None,
  u'edam_formats': [u'format_2572'],
  u'extensions': [u'bam'],
  ...
  u'multiple': False,
  u'name': u'input1', <---------------------------------------|
  u'optional': False,                                         |
  u'options': {u'hda': [], u'hdca': []},                      |
  u'type': u'data'},                                          | Critical
  {...                                                         | information
  u'name': u'sort_mode', <------------------------------------|
  u'optional': False,                                         |
  u'options': [[u'Chromosomal coordinates', u'', True], <-----|
    [u'Read names', u'-n', False]],
  u'type': u'select',
  u'value': u''}]
```

---

class: top
## Tools Object (4/4)

* Inputs information can be displayed with `detail_tool['inputs']`, use this to instantiate the inputs object

  ```python
  myinputs = inputs().set_dataset_param("input1", data_history['id'], src='hda') \
      .set_param("sort_mode", "")
  ```

--

* Now you can launch `samtool sort`

  ```python
  gi.tools.run_tool(new_history['id'], detail_tool['id'], myinputs)
  ```
