### What are Galaxy Interactive Tours?

![](../../images/galaxy_tour_demo.gif)

An awesome way to learn how to use Galaxy or a specific tool, isn't it?

---

### How does it work?

![](../../images/galaxy_tour_yml.png)

A single YAML file: [core.galaxy_ui.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/097300ea6219e14b66b23a0e05f2808b16f10015/config/plugins/tours/core.galaxy_ui.yaml)

---

### At the top of the YAML:<br>Metadata related to the Tour

```
id: galaxy_ui
name: Galaxy UI
description: A gentle introduction to the Galaxy User Interface
title_default: "Welcome to Galaxy"
```

---

### Content of the YAML:<br>Steps of the Tour

```
# A tour is made of several steps, each of them beginning with a dash '-'
steps:
    - title: "Welcome to Galaxy"
      content: "This short tour will guide you through Galaxy's user interface.<br>
                You can navigate with your arrow keys and leave the tour at any
                time point with 'Escape' or the 'End tour' button."
      backdrop: true

    - title: "Upload your data"
      element: ".upload-button"
      content: "Galaxy supports many ways to get in your data.<br>
               Use this button to upload your data."
      placement: "right"
      postclick:
        - ".upload-button"
```
