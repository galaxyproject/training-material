questions:
 - How can I write a tool that can import data into Galaxy from an external database?
 - What are "data sources" and how do they function?
 - Is there any ready-to-use example?

key_points:
 - It is possible to couple an external data resource with a Galaxy server
 - The external data resource is accessed through his native interface
 - Data flows from the external data resource to the Galaxy server without the need of "downloading" the data

# Data Source Integration

An important goal of Galaxy is scalability. A major bottleneck when it comes to analysis of big data sets is the time and space it takes of copying these data sets.

Galaxy provides an interface such that it can communicate with other servers to get data directly into the Galaxy environment of a user without the need
of "downloading" the data. In this hands on, we will use the resource from [DoRiNA Server](http://dorina.mdc-berlin.de/) ({% cite Blin2014 %}).
but the main point about this short section is:
if you have a data source which you think is very important for your research with Galaxy let us know!

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands on!
>
> 1. Create a new history called "doRiNA"
> 2. Go to Get Data::doRiNA search
> 3. Choose hg19 from the drop-down list -> Search Database
> 4. Leave everything as is and choose from the Regulators (set A) drop-down list "hsa-let-7astar-CLASH" -> Search doRiNA
> 5. Use the "Send to Galaxy" button
> 6. Notice the new History Item

You can see the [tutorial section ](http://dorina.mdc-berlin.de/tutorials) of the DoRiNA website for more detailed examples. That was very easy for all of you! If you want your database of choice to be accessible as easy as this **let us know**!
