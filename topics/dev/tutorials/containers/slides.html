## Galaxy in Containers?

.image-75[![](../../images/docker-galaxy-stable-github.png)]

???

When people think Galaxy and containers I think this project comes to mind.
Three years ago Björn created this docker-galaxy-stable project and it has
been wildly successful. It has proven to be a useful toolkit for advanced
deployment options, an extremely portable way to bring Galaxy to new domains,
and a brilliant tool for training users.

https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable/commit/27ef7966508958dfec9ce35ff1c5f076ffccf80f

Also mention Galaxy KickStart as a way to run Galaxy itself in a container.

---

## Containerizing Galaxy vs Tools

We are going to discuss containerizing tool execution instead - executing just jobs in containers.

Containers for the particular job's tool.

However you deploy Galaxy, including in a container, tool execution can still be containerized.

???

### Containerizing Tools is Still Important

* Isolated tool execution.
* Isolate file system access.
* Added layer of security.
* Increased re-computability.
* New deployment options - Kubernetes, Mesos Chronos, AWS Batch, etc.

### Containerizing Tool Execution

Decomposes to basic problems:

* <i class="fa fa-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Instruct Galaxy where to find a container for the tool.
* <i class="fa fa-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Instruct Galaxy to run the tool in a container.

### Configuring Galaxy to Use Containers

Just configure the destination. For instance, transform the cluster destination:

```
<destination id="short_fast" runner="slurm">
    <param id="nativeSpecification">--time=00:05:00 --nodes=1</param>
</destination>
```

as follows:


```
<destination id="short_fast" runner="slurm">
    <param id="nativeSpecification">--time=00:05:00 --nodes=1</param>
    <param id="docker_enabled">true</parma>
    <param id="docker_sudo">false</param>
</destination>
```

That is it!

For development, the Planemo flag `--docker` does this for `test`, `serve`, and related commands.

## Explicit Container Dependencies

Returning to the seqtk example, lets change the `requirements` from:

```
<requirements>
    <requirement type="package" version="1.2">seqtk</requirement>
</requirements>
```

into

```
<requirements>
    <container type="docker">dukegcb/seqtk</container>
    <requirement type="package" version="1.2">seqtk</requirement>
</requirements>
```

Now run Planemo `test` and `serve` with the `--docker` flag and as a tool developer you are done!

* <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Instruct Galaxy to run the tool in a container.

We're done... right?

???

class: left

## The Problems with Making Docker Explicit

* Setting up a `Dockerfile` and publishing a Docker image more process for the tool even though the dependencies have already been completely defined.
* An arbitrary Docker image is a blackbox and there is no guarantee Galaxy will execute the same binaries as the Conda requirements.

---

class: left

## To Put it Another Way

This:

```
<requirements>
    <requirement type="package" version="1.2">seqtk</requirement>
</requirements>
```

should have been sufficient!

And the good news is that now it is (mostly)!

### .image-10[![](../../images/biocontainers.png)] BioContainers - The Magic

Galaxy can now automatically find or build containers for best practice tools.

Planemo will check if such a container has been published with the `--biocontainers` flag to `planemo lint`.

```
$ planemo lint --biocontainers seqtk_seq.xml
...
Applying linter biocontainer_registered... CHECK
.. INFO: BioContainer best-practice container found [quay.io/biocontainers/seqtk:1.2--0].
```

???

But we didn't do anything - where did this magic seqtk container come from.

---

## The Mystery quay.io/biocontainers/seqtk Container

![](../../images/quayioseqtk.png)

???

I swear Planemo did not just create that with `tool_init` or `lint`, maybe we should try using it...

---

class: left

### .image-05[![](../../images/biocontainers.png)] BioContainers - Using the Container

Run Planemo `test` or `serve` with `--biocontainers` to try mystery container.

.reduce70[```

The important line here is - `Checking with container resolver [MulledDockerContainerResolver[namespace=biocontainers]] found description [ContainerDescription[identifier=quay.io/biocontainers/seqtk:1.2--0,type=docker]]`.

### .image-05[![](../../images/biocontainers.png)] BioContainers - The Community

![](../../images/biocontainers_org.png)

???

BioContainers is a big community of informatics minded individuals trying to work
together on building container and Docker based solutions for problems like ours.
Previously the project was called BioDocker.

We are exploiting and contributing to one aspect of BioContainers, in particular
BioConda for Containers.

---

### .image-10[![](../../images/biocontainers.png)] BioContainers - Bioconda for Containers

All Bioconda packages are built into minimal containers.

This setup allows the same binaries to be used within the container or on traditional/HPC resources.
Without any extra work by tool authors, Galaxy can automatically find or build “the correct” container for a best-practice tool.

Over 2,300 containers already published.

---

### .image-05[![](../../images/biocontainers.png)] BioContainers - Lots of Containers

![](../../images/quay_list.png)

???

TODO: Zoom in on the image a bit more ideally.

---

### .image-05[![](../../images/biocontainers.png)] BioContainers - On Demand Creation

Galaxy can be configured to attempt to build containers on demand for containers that haven't
been published to the BioContainers namespace on quay.io.

These containers will have same names as would be published to quay.io (e.g. `quay.io/biocontainers/seqtk:1.2--0`).

---

### Containerizing Tool Execution

#### Decomposes to basic problems

* <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i><i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Instruct Galaxy where to find a container for the tool.
* <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Instruct Galaxy to run the tool in a container.

We're done this time now right?

## Revisiting Galaxy Requirements

![](../../images/galaxy_instance.png)

Many tools have multiple requirements, these need containers also!

???

---

## An Example

The BWA tool is an example of one such tool that has multiple requirements - because samtools is used to sort BAMs after mapping. The Planemo `conda_testing` project is distributed with a simple tool to simulate this containing both `bwa` and `samtools` requirements.

.reduce90[```
$ planemo project_init --template=conda_testing conda_testing
$ cd conda_testing/
$ grep -r require bwa_and_samtools.xml
bwa_and_samtools.xml:    <requirements>
bwa_and_samtools.xml:        <requirement type="package" version="0.7.15">bwa</requirement>
bwa_and_samtools.xml:        <requirement type="package" version="1.3.1">samtools</requirement>
bwa_and_samtools.xml:    </requirements>
```]

---

## Container Hashing

Galaxy finds containers based on the names and versions of requirements, so far we have seen
the hash for single requirements is just the name and the version.

If multiple requirements are present, the hash looks more like a hash. For bwa @ 0.7.15 and samtools @ 1.3.1,
Galaxy will look for a container called:

.reduce50[`quay.io/biocontainers/mulled-v2-fe8faa35dbf6dc65a0f7f5d4ea12e31a79f73e40:03dc1d2818d9de56938078b8b78b82d967c1f820-0`]


---

## Galaxy Terminology - Mulled

To *mull* is to create an environment (either in the Conda sense or globally
inside a container) for one or more Conda packages. The result of this is a
*mulled* environment.

Fixed naming schemes for the resulting environments ensure that different tools
with the same set of requirements can reuse a previously created environment or
container.

If more than one package is included in the resulting environment, a complicated
hash is used as this name.

---

## Mulled Hashing

Back to the example of bwa at version 0.7.15 and samtools at version 1.3.1,
we said the resulting container will be

.reduce50[`quay.io/biocontainers/mulled-v2-fe8faa35dbf6dc65a0f7f5d4ea12e31a79f73e40:03dc1d2818d9de56938078b8b78b82d967c1f820-0`]

This can be broken into these parts:

```
quay.io/ <namespace> /mulled-v2-<package_hash>:<version_hash>-<build>
```

???

Explain the different parts.

## Exploring Mulled Hashes - by Evgeny Anatskiy

![](../../images/multi-package-containers.png)

???

---

## Warning - New Stuff

Only Galaxy's development branch uses this newer mulled v2 hashing, 17.01 and 17.05 used
an older v1 hash.

When using Planemo commands that setup Galaxy, please be sure to add
`--galaxy_branch dev` to the Planemo argument list.

## The Planemo `mull` command (1 / 2)

While Galaxy can be configured to auto-build BioContainers as they are needed, the Planemo `mull` command
can be used to manually build them for your local Docker host.
