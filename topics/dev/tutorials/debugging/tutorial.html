                <p>In this tutorial we will demonstrate how to find and fix common types of bugs you may encounter as a contributor to Galaxy. We will step you through the process of finding and fixing a bug - from locating specific errors in the logs of Galaxy’s GitHub Actions, to identifying their cause, developing a solution and committing your edits</p>

<p>With the skills from this tutorial, it is our hope that you will feel more prepared to develop solutions for Galaxy and more confidently navigate any obstacles along the way.</p>

<h1 id="local-development-environment-setup">Local development environment setup</h1>

<p>For almost every type of error you encounter, there will be a relatively similar process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Locate failing test or error on GitHub Actions</li>
  <li>Run failing test locally</li>
  <li>Identify issue causing failure</li>
  <li>Develop a solution</li>
  <li>Ensure test passes locally</li>
  <li>Commit and push fixed branch to local fork</li>
</ol>

<p>The process for dealing with runtime errors will be somewhat different, since there will be no failed test to review initially. However, in either case, the first step is to setup your local development environment.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, instead of cloning Galaxy’s default branch, we will clone a branch that has been created for this tutorial and contains several bugs that you’ll need to identify and fix. Also, we won’t be opening a pull request in the upstream Galaxy repository.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-pulling-the-buggy-branch">Getting started: Pulling the buggy branch</h2>

<p>Good news! All of the failing tests are on the same Galaxy branch! That means you only need to download and work off of one branch. The downside is that this is one buggy branch with issues all over the place. We have no doubts that you can solve them though!</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Use GitHub UI to fork Galaxy’s repository at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">galaxyproject/galaxy</code>.</li>
    <li>
      <p>Clone your forked repository to a local path, further referred to as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GALAXY_ROOT</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GALAXY_ROOT</code>. Note that we specify the tutorial branch with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-b</code> option:</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Note: In the future, when you contribute to Galaxy, you’ll need to clone the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dev</code> branch, which is the default, so you don’t need to specify the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-b</code> option in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone</code> command).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Before we can use Galaxy, we need to create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies. This is generally done with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">common_startup.sh</code> script:</p>

      <blockquote class="code-in">
        <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-bash-1"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Bash</div>

</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Make sure your Python version is at least 3.6 (you can check your Python version with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python --version</code>). If your system uses an older version, you may specify an alternative Python interpreter using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GALAXY_PYTHON</code> environment variable (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GALAXY_PYTHON=/path/to/alt/python bash scripts/common_startup.sh --dev-wheels</code>).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Activate your new virtual environment:</p>

      <blockquote class="code-in">
        <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-bash-2"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Bash</div>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Once activated, you’ll see the name of the virtual environment prepended to your shell prompt: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(.venv)$</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Finally, let’s create a new branch for your edits:</p>

      <blockquote class="code-in">
        <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-bash-3"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Bash</div>

<h1 id="unit-test-failure">Unit test failure</h1>

<p>Most of Galaxy unit tests are designed to test a separate component or function, are very fast, and do not require a running Galaxy instance. Finding the issue causing a unit test to fail is relatively straightforward.</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <div class="box-title hands-on-title" id="hands-on-fixing-a-failing-unit-test"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Hands-on: Fixing a failing unit test</div>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Finding the failing test on GitHub</strong></p>

      <p>Head over to the <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy">Galaxy repository on GitHub</a> and in the branch drop-down select the “training” branch. Click the red “x” next to the last commit, you’ll get a drop-down listing of workflow results; find “Unit tests / Test (3…” and click “Details”. This will display a detailed report that includes information about the failed tests. Try to find the failed tests.</p>

      <blockquote class="solution">
        <div class="box-title solution-title" id="solution"><button class="gtn-boxify-button solution" type="button" aria-controls="solution" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Solution</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>
        <p>The log lists 2 failed tests:</p>
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- FAILED lib/galaxy/model/tags.py::galaxy.model.tags.TagHandler.parse_tags
- FAILED test/unit/util/test_utils.py::test_strip_control_characters
</code></pre></div>        </div>
        <p>The first is a doctest. While it will provide us with hints on what may have caused the error, the unit test is generally more helpful.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Running the test locally</strong></p>

      <p>An essential requirement for productive development is a fast feedback loop: we want to make a change, run a test, and get immediate feedback. If we push our edits to the remote fork (or submit a pull request to the upstream repository) and wait for the the tests to run remotely, it could take hours before we get any feedback, which is very inefficient (and detrimental to sustaining the joy of programming).</p>

      <p>Instead, we will run the tests locally. Furthermore, we will run a specific test that we know is failing: this will give us the instant feedback we need.</p>

      <blockquote class="code-in">
        <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-bash-5"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Bash</div>
        <p>Make sure you are in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GALAXY_ROOT</code> and your virtual environment is activated. If not, activate it:</p>
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">.</span> .venv/bin/activate
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The simplest way to run the failing test locally is using pytest directly:</p>

      <blockquote class="code-in">
        <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-bash-6"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Bash</div>
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pytest <span class="nb">test</span>/unit/util/test_utils.py
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Do you see the error message?</p>

      <blockquote class="solution">
        <div class="box-title solution-title" id="solution-1"><button class="gtn-boxify-button solution" type="button" aria-controls="solution-1" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Solution</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>
        <p>The test gives us a very specific error message:</p>
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>AssertionError: assert 'b l a' == 'bla'
- bla
+ b l a
?  + +
</code></pre></div>        </div>
        <p>This means that instead of the expected <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bla</code> we got <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">b l a</code> (with spaces).</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Finding and fixing the issue</strong></p>

      <p>Our next step is to open the test file and see what part of the codebase (i.e., what module, class + method or function) is failing to provide the expected result.</p>

      <p>The failing test is calling the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strip_control_characters</code> function in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">util</code> module. That function, apparently, is not producing the expected output. Let’s head over to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib/galaxy/util/__init__.py</code>, where we’ll find the function definition:</p>

      <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">strip_control_characters</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sh">"""</span><span class="s">Strip unicode control characters from a string.</span><span class="sh">"""</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="sh">"</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nf">unicodify</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">unicodedata</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">category</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">Cc</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>The function takes a string as input, and, in theory, returns a copy of that string with certain characters stripped away (it doesn’t really matter what characters are stripped away). However, from the test we see that the string is modified in a different way: spaces have been added between the characters.</p>

      <p>Can you see what’s causing this behavior?</p>

      <blockquote class="solution">
        <div class="box-title solution-title" id="solution-2"><button class="gtn-boxify-button solution" type="button" aria-controls="solution-2" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Solution</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>
        <p>The genexp is evaluated and subsequently joined using a space as a delimiter. The space is, obviously, a typo: we don’t want to <em>add</em> anything to the string, so the delimiter should be the empty string instead:</p>
        <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">return</span> <span class="sh">""</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nf">unicodify</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">unicodedata</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">category</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">Cc</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Make the change, save the file, run the same test. Now it should pass.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Finishing up</strong></p>

      <p>Now you are ready to commit your edits and push the branch to your fork. So, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add [your modified files]</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit -m "[insert your commit message here]"</code>.

<h1 id="api-test-failure">API test failure</h1>

<p>API tests test various aspects of the Galaxy API, as well as general backend aspects of Galaxy using the API. These tests require a Galaxy instance.</p>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Finding the failing test on GitHub</strong></p>

      <p>We’ll follow the same process we used in the unit test section. On GitHub, click the same red “x” and select the “API tests / Test (3…” workflow and click “Details”. Try to find the failed tests.</p>

        <p>The log lists multiple failed tests. Some of them were caused by bugs you’ll be fixing in later sections of this tutorial. For this exercise, we care about these two failed tests:</p>

        <p>Note: occasionally, there could be more failing tests; however, for the purposes of this exercise we are concerned with the licenses tests.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Running the test locally</strong></p>

      <p>Again, we will run the individual test locally. While it is possible to run the test directly with pytest, in this case we will use Galaxy’s script <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run_tests.sh</code>. The script optimizes test runs by sharing the same instance of Galaxy across multiple tests; without the script a new Galaxy will be started for each TestCase class. There are other reasons to run the script; for more information check the documentation block at the top of the script.</p>

      <p>Make sure you are in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GALAXY_ROOT</code> (if your virtual environment is not activated, the script will do it for you).</p>

      <p>Let’s run the failed test:</p>

      <blockquote class="code-in">

      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Finding and fixing the issue</strong></p>

      <p>We can use either one of the failing tests to start debugging. Let’s use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test_get_license</code>. As with the unit test, first let’s take a look at the test function definition (located in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib/galaxy_test/api/test_licenses.py</code>):</p>

      <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_get_license</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">self</span><span class="p">):</span>

</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>The important line here is line 3: it tells us what API endpoint is called: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">licenses/{licenseId}</code>.</p>

      <p>Our next step is to examine the controller for this endpoint. For that, we head over to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib/galaxy/webapps/galaxy/api/licenses.py</code>.</p>

      <p>If you look at the FastAPI controller, you’ll see the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get</code> method that is responsible for fetching the data in response to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code> HTTP request received at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">licenses/{licenseId}</code> endpoint:</p>

      <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    <span class="nd">@router.get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">/api/licenses/{id}</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">,</span>

</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>The only thing in this method that matters to us is the last line:</p>

      <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">licenses_manager</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">get_license_by_id</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>Why? Because despite all this syntax, the method simply redirects the request to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self.licenses_manager</code>. If we read the code, we’ll quickly see that this variable holds an instance of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LicencesManager</code>, which (look at the import statements at the top of the file) is located in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib/galaxy/managers/licenses.py</code>. Which is where we should look next.</p>

      <p>If we carefully trace the code in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LicensesManager</code>, we’ll find the error. Do you see it?</p>

<h1 id="client-linting-error">Client linting error</h1>

<p>Client Linting is important to reduce errors, improve quality of the codebase, and enforce common rules. These rules are defined by the eslinter defined with Vue best practices, primarily. On Github, the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eslint</code> is run to start the process for linting code on the client side.</p>

  <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-python-linting"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment: Python Linting</div>
  <p>For backend consistency, we also have a Python linter. While we won’t be running you through that exercise today, you may encounter a Python linting issue in the future. The way to diagnose and treat these is very similar to the way to do it for the front end.</p>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Finding the failing test on GitHub</strong></p>

      <p>With this error, one of the failing test workflows on GitHub would normally be “get_code_and_test”. However, since we are working on a branch that contains multiple bugs by design, some of the test failures overlap, as a result of which the “get_code_and_test” workflow has been skipped in the last commit.</p>

      <p>Therefore, in this section, for the remote results, we’ll have to describe what would have been displayed.</p>

      <p>One of the failing tests on GitHub says “get_code_and_test”. Clicking on the word “Details” assocated with this failure will open a brief view of the CircleCI Checks, with a list of tests that are run as part of that command. You’ll see that the one that is failing is js_lint. And if you click that, you’ll be navigated to the CicleCI app, where you can see much more information about the failures.</p>

      <p>Here you can see the exact command that ran to lint our codebase:</p>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd client &amp;&amp; yarn run eslint
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>We can also see that it has found 1 error, where that error is located, and a description of the problem.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Running the linter locally</strong></p>

      <p>Alright, so we’ve seen the failure, but we want to verify it locally now. For this, you’ll need to open up a terminal.</p>

      <blockquote class="code-in">
        <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-bash-8"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Bash</div>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Then you’ve got two options. You can run the same exact command that CircleCI uses, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd client &amp;&amp; yarn run eslint</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make client-lint</code>, which does <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd client &amp;&amp; yarn run eslint &amp;&amp; yarn run prettier-check</code>. This will also make sure your code conforms to formatting standards.</p>

      <p>After running that, you should see the same linting error from CircleCI; you should know where it is and how to fix it too!</p>

      <p>If you think you’ve got it, try running the test locally again to be sure.</p>

<h1 id="client-unit-test-failure">Client unit test failure</h1>

<p>Client tests are tests written by developers to test front-end code. In the case of the test we’re going to walk through right now, we’re looking at a Vue test failure, which means the component that it’s testing is definitely a Vue component.</p>

      <p>To run the client tests locally, you must be in the client directory; if you’re just in the galaxy directory, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd client</code> should take you to the right place.</p>

      <p>Next, type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yarn run test</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yarn jest</code> to run all the client tests.</p>

      <p>The output should match what you found on Github.</p>

      <p><strong>Finding and fixing the issue</strong></p>

      <p>Next up, finding the error. Here are some tips:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Take a look at the failing test and the imports to find out which Vue component the test correlates to.</li>
        <li>Look at the test to see what it does. Is there an error in the test?</li>
        <li>Look at the Vue component where the failure seems to be taking place. Is the error located there?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The solution is hidden below, but try your hand at fixing it first:</p>

      <blockquote class="solution">
        <div class="box-title solution-title" id="solution-8"><button class="gtn-boxify-button solution" type="button" aria-controls="solution-8" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Solution</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>
        <p>The failure is only happening on the disabled test case, so take a look in the template of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SavedRulesSelector</code> where the conditions for adding disabled are defined.</p>

        <p>The way it’s worded in the test (and the way one could think about it logically), is that if there is no history, the button should be disabled, but the code says</p>

        <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">:</span><span class="kd">class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">{ disabled: numOfSavedRules == 1 }</span><span class="dl">"</span>
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>– whoops! A very silly off by one error. On that very same line, change the 1 to a 0, and run the test again.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>If you think you’ve got it, try running the test locally again to be sure.</p>

      <blockquote class="comment">
        <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-running-fewer-client-tests"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment: Running fewer client tests</div>
        <p>If you don’t want to run the whole suite of client tests, you can add keywords that match the test path/name. For example both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yarn run jest rule</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yarn jest selector</code> will work, but the former will run other tests with rule in the path/module name.</p>

<h1 id="selenium-test-failure">Selenium test failure</h1>

<p>Selenium is the end-to-end or integration testing framework that we use; so these tests often are designed to test both frontend and backend code. This makes fixing them a little difficult, but we are sure you can do it!</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <div class="box-title hands-on-title" id="hands-on-fixing-a-failing-selenium-test"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Hands-on: Fixing a failing Selenium test</div>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Finding the failing test on GitHub</strong></p>

      <p>There may be actually a few failing Selenium tests, but the good news is, they are the result of only one little error. The failing tests on GitHub are in the “Selenium Test 3.7,0” and “Selenium Test 3.7,1” workflows. When you click on the details of this one, it’s not always very clear which test is causing the failure, but if you download the artifacts, it’s very clear which tests have failed.</p>

      <p>Try to identify which tests are failing based on artifacts you downloaded.</p>

      <blockquote class="solution">
        <div class="box-title solution-title" id="solution-9"><button class="gtn-boxify-button solution" type="button" aria-controls="solution-9" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Solution</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

        <p>The failing tests are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test_build_list_and_show_items</code></li>
          <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test_upload_pair_specify_extension</code></li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Running the tests locally</strong></p>

      <p>Make sure you are in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GALAXY_ROOT</code> (if your virtual environment is not activated, the script will do it for you).</p>

      <p>We do not want to run the full suite of Selenium tests here - that would take a lot of time and we already know that most of them passed.</p>

      <p>Instead, we can build our commands to only run a subset of the tests. Here’s an example: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./run_tests.sh -selenium lib/galaxy_test/selenium/test_sign_out.py</code></p>

      <p>A command like that will still run all of the tests defined in that python file, so we need to find out where the tests that failed are defined. Try seaching the baseline for our three failing Selenium tests; what files are they in?</p>

      <blockquote class="solution">
        <div class="box-title solution-title" id="solution-10"><button class="gtn-boxify-button solution" type="button" aria-controls="solution-10" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Solution</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

        <p>The failing tests are defined in these files:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib/galaxy_test/selenium/test_collection_builders.py</code></li>
          <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib/galaxy_test/selenium/test_uploads.py</code></li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Now that we have the files, we can run the selenium tests. The command to do this should be very similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./run_tests.sh -selenium lib/galaxy_test/selenium/test_sign_out.py</code>. The only difference should be the python file where the tests are defined. Try it yourself, before checking out the solution.</p>

      <blockquote class="solution">
        <div class="box-title solution-title" id="solution-11"><button class="gtn-boxify-button solution" type="button" aria-controls="solution-11" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Solution</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

        <p>Either of these two commands will work:</p>

        <blockquote class="code-in">
          <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-bash-10"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Bash</div>
          <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./run_tests.sh <span class="nt">-selenium</span> lib/galaxy_test/selenium/test_collection_builders.py
</code></pre></div>          </div>
          <p>or</p>
          <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./run_tests.sh <span class="nt">-selenium</span> lib/galaxy_test/selenium/test_uploads.py
</code></pre></div>          </div>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Running any of these tests will show us that the tests are still failing on our local machine. So, you should see a failing test that matches one of the three we identified from the downloaded artifacts. Onward to fixing them!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Finding and fixing the issue</strong></p>

      <p>Good news - there’s an easy way to figure out what’s going wrong with a selenium test!</p>

      <p>In your terminal type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">export GALAXY_TEST_SELENIUM_HEADLESS=false</code>. This will allow you to see the test running in real time.</p>

      <p>Re-run the selenium test to watch the headless browser step through the test.</p>

      <p>Looking at the test run in the headless browser, alongside the definition for the test should help you understand what might be going wrong. Try and figure out where the problem is on your own, before looking at the solution.</p>

      <blockquote class="solution">

        <p>The problem is that the tests are expecting a different HID (history identifier) than what is being made available to them. Since all the failing tests have to do with Lists, you might want to check out the ListCollectionCreator.</p>

        <p>For comparisons sake, open one of the other CollectionCreators, as well and see if you can spot anything that is amiss.</p>

        <p>Pay careful attention in the template to the <collection-creator> props.</collection-creator></p>

        <p>Here you should notice that in the PairCollectionCreator or in the PairedListCollectionCreator, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:hide-source-items="hideSourceItems"</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:hide-source-items="!hideSourceItems"</code>. It’s a little change, just flipping the boolean, but it makes a big difference!</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Awesome! If you’re here, you’ve found and fixed the problem, at least, in theory.</p>

      <p>If you think you’ve got it, try running the tests locally again to be sure. In this simulated case, you can get by with just running one of the tests, but in reality, you should probably run all three Selenium tests to be sure that it’s totally fixed.</p>

      <p>Being able to reproduce a bug is good: this means you’re on your way to fixing it, and you know what to look for! In a real scenario, it is not uncommon that a bug is not easily reproduceable, which makes fixing it a much more complicated task.</p>

      <p>To figure out what’s happening, our best bet is to look at the Galaxy log (look at the terminal window from which you launched Galaxy). Can you see the error message?</p>

      <p><strong>Identify the problem</strong></p>

      <p>We will investigate using pdb - our trusted Python debugger!</p>

      <p>pdb offers a wide range of functionality and is exceptionally useful for debugging at runtime. We encourage you to read its <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html">documentation</a>; however for this exercise we will only use the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#breakpoint">breakpoint()</a> function, that drops us into pdb.</p>

      <p>Add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">breakpoint()</code> statement to your code, right above the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if/else</code> block.</p>

      <p>Now we need to restart Galaxy. However, to use pdb, we need to enable Galaxy’s debug configuration option. In general, it may be a good idea to enable this in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">galaxy.yml</code> configuration file (just copy or rename <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/galaxy.yml.sample</code> and uncomment the option you want to set). However, for the purposes of this exercise, it’s enough to set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GALAXY_CONFIG_DEBUG</code> environment variable when running Galaxy:</p>

      <blockquote class="code-in">
        <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-bash-12"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Bash</div>

        <div class="box-title comment-title" id="comment-why-we-set-the-debug-option"><i class="far fa-comment-dots" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Comment: Why we set the debug option</div>

        <p>The reason for setting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">debug</code> option for releases prior to 22.05 was quite esoteric: among other things, it prevents uWSGI (no longer used as of 22.05) from remapping <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stdin</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dev/null</code> which would prevent tools like pdb from running.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Now your Galaxy is running in debug mode. Repeat your steps that reproduced the error. When you click “Datasets”, head over to your terminal. At the bottom of the log you’ll see something like this:</p>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; /home/sergey/2sandbox/galaxy/dev_training/lib/galaxy/webapps/galaxy/api/datasets.py(97)index()

(Pdb)
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>You’re at the pdb prompt. From here you can execute Python code interactively. The logs printed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stdout</code> can be distracting, so try to ignore them. Let’s explore what’s happening in the next line:</p>

      <blockquote class="code-in">
        <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-pdb"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Pdb</div>
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(Pdb) trans

      </blockquote>

      <p>We could have just typed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trans.app.config.get</code>, of course; the steps above give us some additional context.</p>

      <p>Now let’s take a look at the definition of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get</code> method. We need to find <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CommonConfigurationMixin</code> which is used by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">galaxy.config.GalaxyAppConfiguration</code>.</p>

      <p>Head over to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib/galaxy/config/__init__.py</code> and look for the class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CommonConfigurationMixin</code>. Once you find it, look for the definition of its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get</code> method. When you find it, look at the method signature. What is the meaning of the argument <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'True'</code> that is passed to this method in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">datasets.py</code> on line 97?</p>

        <p>The argument <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code> corresponds to the parameter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">default</code>. In the method’s body, we see that this value will be passed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self.config_dict.get()</code>; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self.config_dict</code> is a Python dictionary, so the second argument to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get()</code> is the default value that will be retuned if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">key</code> is not in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self.config_dict</code>.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Back to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">datasets.py</code>, line 97. Now we know that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code> is the default value that will be returned if the key <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show_datasets</code> does not exist in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config_dict</code> dictionary. Moving on:</p>

      <blockquote class="code-in">
        <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-pdb-1"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Pdb</div>

      </blockquote>

      <p>So, we see that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show_datasets</code> does not exist and we get the default value, which is the string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'True'</code>.</p>

      <p>Next step: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str_to_bool</code>. First, let’s pass it the value <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'True'</code>:</p>

      <blockquote class="code-in">

      </blockquote>

      <p>That doesn’t look right! Exit the debugger (type in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">q</code>, then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Enter</code>, then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CTRL-C </code> to exit Galaxy.
Head over to the function’s definition (you can tell from the import statement at the top of the file that it’s in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib/galaxy/util/__init__.py</code>) and try to figure out if there is an error.</p>

      <blockquote class="solution">

        <p>At first glance, everything seems right. But think of what value we are passing: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'True'</code> - it is <em>not</em> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">('true', 'yes', 'on', '1')</code> tuple! Aparently, the developer did not account for upper vs. lower case!</p>

        <p>Do NOT fix the error just yet.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Write a test exposing the bug</strong></p>

      <p>Before you fix code that was not covered by a test, write the test to expose the bug! In this case we have a simple, completely isolated function - a simple unit test should do. Your test should go into this module: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test/unit/util/test_utils.py</code>.</p>

      <p>Start with a blank test function. Then call the funtion under test (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str_as_bool</code>) and assert that when you pass it the value <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'True'</code>, it returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code>. Can you think of more cases to test?</p>

      <blockquote class="solution">
        <div class="box-title solution-title" id="solution-17"><button class="gtn-boxify-button solution" type="button" aria-controls="solution-17" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Solution</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

        <p>Your first step could be something like this:</p>

        <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_str_as_bool</span><span class="p">():</span>

</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>However, keep in mind that there may be other cases of mixed or uppercase values. You should also test for lowercase values - to make sure that while fixing the bug you don’t break the current functionality. And remember to test for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">False</code> cases as well.</p>

        <p>There are many ways to implement this, feel free to write your own. Here’s one option:</p>

        <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_str_as_bool</span><span class="p">():</span>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Fix the error</strong></p>

      <p>Can you think of a simple way to fix the function so that our test passes?</p>

      <blockquote class="solution">

        <p>In fact, that’s exactly what the real function does!

      </blockquote>

      <p>Run the test - now it should pass!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Ensure the error no longer occurs</strong></p>

      <p>Now that we have the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str_as_bool</code> function covered by test, as a bonus, we can safely do some minor refactoring: the test will prevent us from breaking things. Can you simplify the function’s code?</p>

      <p>Finally, head back to your local Galaxy and verify that the runtime error no longer occurs:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Remove the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">breakpoint()</code> statement you added to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib/galaxy/webapps/galaxy/api/datasets.py</code>.</li>
        <li>Start Galaxy and repeat the steps from the bug report (select “User” &gt; “Datasets”). You should see the Datasets page now - no more error message!</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Congratulations - you’ve completed the last and, possibly, most challenging section of this tutorial!</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Finally, we’re back in the Green - all tests pass!</p>

<p>First of all, thank you for completing this tutorial. We hope you feel more confident debugging Galaxy code and understanding how to navigate the testing frameworks we utilize. Of course, we are always available to help answer questions and support you!</p>

					<b>Liked</b>: Good tutorial, but it is outdated. There is no training branch to be found on the galaxy Github (no old training, no new training2022 or the like).  I managed to find the branch here: https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/14339 and cloned https://github.com/jdavcs/galaxy/tree/training2022  which made me able to do the training. But I believe that is the reason there were minor differences furtherdown the tutorial as it is a year old so I think this is the problem that would fix the rest.
