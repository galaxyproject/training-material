Plese see [the installation section](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/tutorials/tool-from-scratch/tutorial.html#installing-planemo). Essentially you can `pip install planemo`. If you don’t have pip, you need to install this first.

On windows you’ll need `WSL2` and then you can `apt-get install python3-pip`, same for ubuntu. For OSX users it is probably present.
