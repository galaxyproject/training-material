# Javascript Plugin Development in Galaxy

---

## Tutorial Overview

- Why visualization?

- What are the available visualization types and which one should I use?

- Introduction to Charts

- Step-by-step guide to adding new visualizations

## Why visualizations?


![Animated gif cycling through Anscombe's quartet and various variations that all have the same mean, SD, and correlation but look vastly different to someone's eyes.](../../images/anscombe-quartet-animated.gif)

```python
X mean: 54.26, X SD: 16.76
Y mean: 47.83, Y SD: 26.93
Corr: -0.06
```

???
Anscombe's quartet, all these datasets have same mean, standard deviation and correlation,
yet when visualizing them it is revealed they have vastly different structures.

## Types of visualizations in Galaxy

- **Trackster** - built-in genome browser
- **Display applications**
  - UCSC Genome Browser
  - IGV
- **Galaxy tools**
  - JBrowse
  - Krona
- **Visualization plugins**
  - Charts
  - Generic
- **Interactive Environments**
  - Jupyter/Rstudio
  - IOBIO (bam/vcf visualizations)
  - Phinch (metagenomics visualizations)

---

## Which should I use?

![Flowchart. Only available on an external website? If yes use a display application. Does it need to be served (e.g. python), if yes use an interactive tool. Is it computationally intensive, then it needs to be a regular tool. Is it written in javascript? Then it shold be a generic plugin. If it passes all these tests it can be a charts plugin.](../../images/which_viz_flowchart.png)

## Charts Visualization Framework

---

## Charts
A shared interface for a wide range of pure JavaScript visualization types i.e.
bar diagrams, pie charts, scatter plots, heat maps and others.

## Chart Configuration - Bar chart example

---

If a plugin is unavailable, custom visualization types like this heat map here can be added.

![A large zoomed out heatmap is shown with an inset highlighting a small portion.](../../images/charts_heatmap.png)

Charts is able to pre-process large-scale data behind the scenes.

## Charts - PDB viewer example

## Community-driven plugins

![Montage of several logos include D3, jqPlot, BioJS, Cytoscape, and NVD3.](../../images/charts_community.png)
