summary: "Resources part of the field guide. Work in progress. Please help make it better?"
questions:
  - "What are the main identifiable project resources?"
  - "How do they all fit together?"
  - "Who pays for the 'free' analysis computational resources?"
objectives:
  - "Understand what resources are used in the project"
  - "Understand how those resources are provided"
 
time_estimation: 10m
subtopic: resources
key_points:
  - "Galaxy is a complicated, participatory self-governing collaborative community project"
  - "Participants engage with the project on their own individual terms"
  - "Multiple perspectives and opinions are needed to see the whole interacting structure"
  - "Vision: Build hard features like reproducibility into an analysis framework with pluggable tools"
  - "Running code as a free service provides effective stress testing for software defects and useability"
  - "Project depends on and collaborates as part of the open science ecosystem"
  - "Started in genomics but now adapted to suit many data rich disciplines"
  - "New contributors and investigators are highly valued and warmly welcomed"

> - Work in progress!! First draft to try to get a structure to make sense.
> - Needs many contributors to make it useful. What would you like to have known, when you first tried getting things done in Galaxy?
> Please add what's missing and fix what's broken. Headings are mostly stubs waiting to be edited and extended 
> - Trying to describe the big picture will necessarily be big. Will probably need to break this already very wordy module into separate parts.
> - Add your story or stories to the stories tutorial too please!
> - Ross has strong opinions. 
> - Many of them are probably wrong but he doesn't know which ones yet. 
> - Please feel free to contribute your own, to make this more useful to future readers.

> <comment-title>Note to readers</comment-title>
> - This module introduces the most important parts of the Galaxy project. They are grouped arbitrarily and there are many overlaps, because Galaxy grows organically through collaborations, rather than by design.
> - The project continues to expand rapidly, so this module will need updating regularly
> - The Hub provides much more detail about many of the same structures and their activities, but this material is designed to provide simplified views of the project, so the Hub becomes easier to navigate.
> - This is an attempt at a kind of field guide to the ecosystem generating those Hub activities, for the use of participants trying to navigate it.

# 2. Resources used in Galaxy

- Many different kinds of resources are needed to support all the "free" services
- Large scale computational infrastructure and professionals 
- Individual skilled contributors
- Engaged communities
- Other interacting open communities

## Source code
- Open source communities provide
    - Galaxy source code dependencies
    - Command line analysis package code for tools
- Without these, Galaxy could not exist.
- Github committers and community
- The core framework code, markup for the Hub and GTN, and other resources are also maintained on GitHub, allowing pull requests with independent review before changes are accepted.

## Computational infrastructure, support and analysis services

"Free" user allocations for storage and computing depend on the available resources and the intensity of user demand. They are sufficient for many common data intensive projects, but are not suitable for very large data or extremely demanding computing because availability is limited to the resources provided by collaborators and it is far from infinite. 

Each of the main usegalaxy.* services shares the main source code, and system administrators share their skills, but they each involve a different set of hardware and storage, so there are important differences in the fine detail of deployment.

## Collaborating grants
- Would PI's want to advertise their deliverables here?
- One way of letting potential collaborators know what you're doing?
- Does not need budgets :)
- AnVIL
- Cancer....
- Your ideas here please?

## Community contributors
- Very important resource
- Bug fixes, ideas...
