title: "2. How people organise themselves in the Galaxy project"
summary: "People part of the guide. Work in progress. Please help make it better?"
questions:
  - "What are the main communities?"
  - "What are the main management bodies?"
  - "How do they all fit together?"
  - "Who pays for the 'free' analysis computational resources?"

time_estimation:
subtopic: people
key_points:
  - "Galaxy is a complicated, participatory self-governing collaborative community project"

> <comment-title>Note to contributors</comment-title>
> - Work in progress!! First draft to try to get a structure to make sense.
> - Needs many contributors to make it useful. What would you like to have known, when you first tried getting things done in Galaxy?
> Please add what's missing and fix what's broken. Headings are mostly stubs waiting to be edited and extended 
> - Trying to describe the big picture will necessarily be big. Will probably need to break this already very wordy module into separate parts.
> - Add your story or stories to the stories tutorial too please!
> - Ross has strong opinions. 
> - Many of them are probably wrong but he doesn't know which ones yet. 
> - Please feel free to contribute your own, to make this more useful to future readers.

> <comment-title>Note to readers</comment-title>
> - This module introduces the most important parts of the Galaxy project. They are grouped arbitrarily and there are many overlaps, because Galaxy grows organically through collaborations, rather than by design.
> - The project continues to expand rapidly, so this module will need updating regularly
> - The Hub provides much more detail about many of the same structures and their activities, but this material is designed to provide simplified views of the project, so the Hub becomes easier to navigate.
> - This is an attempt at a kind of field guide to the ecosystem generating those Hub activities, for the use of participants trying to navigate it.

# 1. People: Individuals, collaborations, communities and governance


This field guide begins with people and their interactions in communities and structures

- Seeing how they have organised themselves provides one useful perspective on the project. Many individuals are part of more than one of the organisations and communities below. Galaxy participants govern themselves, and coercion is never an option for getting things done.
- People provide the project inputs. Investigators bring resources and skills. Contributors volunteer their skills to make things even better. The sum of this combined effort produces the project outputs.
- Focus here is on *how* they organise themselves to get things done, rather than exactly *what* they do. Those details are on the [Hub](https://galaxyproject.org/)
- If any activity of the project looks interesting, please get in touch!


## Communities of Practice

- Participants sharing an interest in a specific field form field-focussed communities
- Galaxy began with a focus on tools for analysing commodity sequencing data.
- Many new fields have adopted it for their own data and analyses
- Some of these are described in the companion stories tutorial.
- Best practice tool kits are maintained by contributors working in many fields:
    - [Proteomics](../../../proteomics)
    - [Climate science](../../../climate)
    - [Microbiome](../../../metagenomics)
    - public health 
    - small server administrators
    - add your own here...

## Regions

- Participants also tend to create geographically local communities and activities
- North America
- Europe
- Australia
- India
- add your own here...

## Developers

- Communities of developers are recognisable in the various source code repositories
- Interact through github issues, pull requests, and matrix chat channels

## Collaborating investigators

- Independent principal investigators
- Multiple independent grants that support interacting project deliverables
- Support source code, hub, usegalaxy.* analysis services, Galaxy Training Network, communities...
- Provide resources at scale for "free" Galaxy analysis services


> <details-title>Collaborative resources in more details</details-title>
> - Free analysis consumes substantial research infrastructure and computational resources 
> - Project activities are supported by highly skilled professionals
> - Independent grants operate efficiently for their own goals and can pool resources
> - Efficient collaboration magnifies their individual impact.
> - No single grant could encompass the complexity of institutions and resources involved
> - Some are code focussed, others provide resources such as the GTN and usegalaxy.* services
> - Community engagement and contribution adds import additional value
> - These must work together efficiently for the project to succeed.

## Contributors
 
- Galaxy is an open project
    - contributors are welcomed and supported
    - Project success and sustainability depends on contributions from community members.
- Project complexity offers many opportunities for contribution
- Suggestions are always welcomed to make it easier to navigate.
- In the past, community members turn into highly valued contributors
- Finding their own particular way to join in according to their situation.
- More recently, effort is being devoted to documenting and clarifying the process, to make it far easier to navigate, for all kinds of contributors. 
- This training module is part of that effort
- See the contributor stories material to learn how useful contributions have been made.

> <details-title>Examples for different kinds of skills and interests</details-title>
> - Issues can be raised and pull request submitted for review at the github repository. 
> - The GTN provides integrated tutorials on using Galaxy, and technical capacity building training material, such as on server administration, and on making GTN tutorials. Infrastructure for slides narrated in multiple languages, and hands-on tutorials applying real Galaxy tools to real data are supported.
> - The IUC provides best practice guidance and GTN training modules to help developers build new tool wrappers for Galaxy, and automated infrastructure to help maintain them efficiently.
> - GGSC offers opportunities for motivated community members to initiate and lead community development collaborations that can help the project to expand into activities that help support and expand subcommunities of users.
> - Working groups provide opportunities for the contribution of technical and other skills in focussed project areas ranging from GUI development through to training and outreach.
