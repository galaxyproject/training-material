title: "Stories of success: How important project activities got themselves started"
questions:
  - "Who controls new activities being added to the project?"
  - "Are there examples of new project initiatives being developed by participants?"
  - "What structures support community development initiatives"
  - "How are technical decisions made about the source code?"
  - "How are big decisions really made?"
  - "Who's really in charge of the project?"
  - "Why is contribution from the community so important?"
  - "How can people participate in the project as contributors?"
objectives:
  - "Understand some Galaxy community development stories as examples of how things are done"
  - "Understand how different project communities work together to make things happen"
  - "Understand the importance of community development and contributor engagement to project sustainability"
 
time_estimation:
subtopic: anatomy
key_points:
  - "Galaxy is a global collaboration"
  - "It provides great value to scientists as a platform for transparent analysis"
  - "That value is created by coordinating the work of hundreds of individuals"
  - "The collaboration welcomes new ideas to expand and improve the project"
  - "Stories about how people found their way in starting new ideas help explain how the project functions"

# Many paths to making new things happen in Galaxy

- Galaxy is a big, complicated project with many moving parts.
- Starting something new is hard enough but even harder when it's not clear how to begin
- Seeing how existing activities started may offer insight
- Useful for new project activity planning
- The stories below have been contributed by the people who did the work
- Individual leadership in response to genuine need, and collaboration underly them all


## Proteomics communities: a case-study

The unique features of tool flexibility and availability, provenance tracking, workflow development, scalability and a user-interface offered unique aspects to mainly Windows-centric, standalone software options in the field.  As an example, the Galaxy for proteomics project started at the University of Minnesota around 2010 was borne of need for a scalable, enterprise workflow solution to support analyses of datasets being produced on campus.  The Minnesota Supercomputing Institute (MSI) supported these computational needs and sought out solutions.  Because of connections to the genomics community, MSI personnel were aware of Galaxy.  The forward-looking design of Galaxy offered potential for applications beyond genomics, and exploratory work was initiated to investigate suitability for proteomics needs.

These explorations resulted in revelations about new possibilities for using Galaxy beyond domain-centric analyses (proteomics), and further developing multi-omic applications such as proteogenomics which integrates genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data for novel molecular characterization of systems.  The innovation offered by multi-omics, coupled with the numerous unique advantages of Galaxy (access and training in use of complex workflows by novice users in particular), proved a competitive advantage in seeking funding to support development work.  These qualities have carried on since early days of development to gained continued support of Galaxy-P, as plausible arguments can be made to reviewers that this is not just another software tool but rather an ecosystem with unique, beneficial features.  A number of other groups across the world (Europe, Australia) have also recognized these benefits, and via coordination through the Galaxy-P team, a community of developers and users has been built and sustained.

## IUC

*Ross just wanted to try this out. Not a good example because it was a team initiative rather than from the community?*

- The IUC was created initially in 2012 by Greg Von Kuster, and involved the most active toolshed contributors at the time.
- Unlike many of the other stories here, it was started by the team
- Initially as a way to mark reliable Toolshed tools
- The Toolshed was always meant to be an open resource resource
- In practice, this results in contributions of variable reliability.
- User demand for identifiably curated and reliable tools was increasing. 
- Like everything else, it has adapted to changing needs with growth over time.
- Now provides 
    - "Best practice" tool wrapper implementation guidelines.
    - Tool code repository automation
    - Tool development utilities and support.
    - Maintains wrappers for many popular and important new packages
    - Training topic content contributions.
- Open to community participants who are interested in helping out.
- Gitter channel supports contributors developing new tool wrappers.

> Hello everyone,
> 
> Thanks to each of you for agreeing to be a charter member of the new Intergalactic Utilities Commission (IUC).  In agreeing to membership, you are now deemed to be an Intergalactic Utilities Commissioner!
> 
> The goals of the IUC include enabling the pervasive use of the main Galaxy tool shed by:
> 
> a. Ensuring the repositories available in the tool shed include contents that are functionally correct and optimized for installation into local Galaxies.  New features will soon be introduced to the tool shed enabling repositories to be flagged as "IUC Approved".  When appropriate, guidance should be provided to repository owners so that they can understand what changes are necessary for their repository to be approved.
> 
> b. Providing prioritization guidance to the Galaxy Tool Shed developers for the implementation of upcoming new features. 
> 
> A detailed understanding of the tool shed and it's current and upcoming features and behaviors is necessary in order for the IUC to be successful with these goals.  We would like to schedule a teleconference towards the end of September using Google Hangout to start guiding you through this process.  We'll work with you to schedule the conference so it is as convenient as possible for the various time zones, and we'll send out an agenda a few days prior to the scheduled discussion.
> 
> In preparation for this first teleconference, if you have not already done so, please make sure to read the tool shed wiki at http://wiki.g2.bx.psu.edu/Tool%20Shed.  I know that the wiki is a bit monolithic, and I am planning to break it up as soon as I get a chance, but it contains valuable details that are essential to understand as we start this process.
> 
> In addition, I am willing to answer some questions from you via email to help prepare for this if needed.  Let us know if you feel that yet another email list is appropriate for this (e.g., iuc@galaxyproject.org or something similar).
> 
> Thanks very much,
