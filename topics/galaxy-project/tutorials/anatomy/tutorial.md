# Alternative ways of seeing Galaxy

- Galaxy is a big, complicated project with many moving parts making it hard to comprehend completely
- What you see depends on how you look at it, so people see different things such as:
    - Convenient and reliable way to get complex analyses done for users
    - Interdependent open source code repositories for developers.
    - Global collaboration for investigators
- This module outlines the major components, and how they fit together
- Drafted by a human, it represents only one of many possible explanations

> <tip-title>Classifying components in a global open science project is a hard problem</tip-title>
> - Categories and divisions are necessarily arbitrary. 
> - The project has grown of its own accord, not neatly from a blueprint.
> - Driven by shared vision and values, adapting to rapid external developments
> - Many participants, structures and processes that fit into more than one category. 
>    - Most users identify with multiple different communities for example.
> - No obvious “best” way to describe an open science collaborative ecosystem.
> - No known terminology for the components or interactions.
> - Need to invent a descriptive approach.

## Simple functional model: People + Grant resource inputs = Project outputs


- People working together make the project possible
    - Self governed collaboration
        - Many independent institutions and investigators 
        - No single institution has control
    -  Individuals engage with the project on their own terms
       - Leading and participating in community activities
       - Communities of practice
       - Collaborating investigators with grant resources
       - Contributing training material, documentation, source code 
       - Participation and leadership in governance
- Grant resource inputs help sustain the communities, team, collaborations and services
    - Supports core "corporate" project services
    - Source code maintenance, support and enhancenments,...,GTN
    - Computational resource allocations for free services
        - adding substantial value to the source
        - Free analysis and training services
    - Professional staff
        - outreach, communication, project management.
        - user support, system administration and software engineers.
- Project outputs - things the project delivers for open science and scientists
    - Source code
    - Online analysis services
    - GTN open access to training material any time and to periodic training intensives.
        - Provides capacity building resources:
            - Introductory Galaxy useage training
            - Specialised training 
                - for users doing common analyses in a range of specialties 
                - for tool wrapper and software developers
                - for trainers
                - for server system administrators  
    - Best practice standards and automation for writing tool wrappers and workflows - IUC
    - Communities of practice specialty toolkits such as in proteomics or ecology.
- Galaxy exists as part of the global open science ecosystem.

# People and organisation

- How people engage and work together is central to understanding how Galaxy works
- The inputs and outputs are left to the end.

## Communities

- Participants form relationships and communities
- Usually self identified as a shared interest that drives some collaboration or organisation
- Open source shared values regulate interactions, so they are inclusive, participatory, professional.
    - Project strives to engage contributors and users
    - Supporting and listening helps focus on real scientific need
    - Engaged and skilled community members provide valuable contributions to improve the project
- Formal and informal communities, sharing a distinguishing common interest or feature
    - Developers and contributors collaborate in an ecology of open source communities
    - Communities contribute important tool kits and training material.
- Important part of project growth and sustainability.
- Core resource that adds enormous value to the project

### Communities of Practice

- Communities developing and supporting specialised fields - proteomics, climate science
- small scale admins - people responsible for keeping Galaxy services running

### Regions

### Developers



## Collaborating investigators

- Independent principal investigators
- Multiple independent grants that support interacting project deliverables
- Support source code, hub, usegalaxy.* analysis services, Galaxy Training Network.
- "Free" Galaxy analysis services are sustained by large research grants


> <tip-title>Collaborative resources in more details</tip-title>
> - Free analysis consumes substantial research infrastructure and computational resources 
> - Project activities are supported by highly skilled professionals
> - Independent grants operate efficiently for their own goals and can pool resources
> - Efficient collaboration magnifies their individual impact.
> - No single grant could encompass the complexity of institutions and resources involved
> - Some are code focussed, others provide resources such as the GTN and usegalaxy.* services
> - Community engagement and contribution adds import additional value
> - These must work together efficiently for the project to succeed.

## Contributors

- Galaxy is an open project, where contributors are welcomed and supported
- Project success and sustainability depends on contributions from community members.
- Project complexity offers many opportunities for contribution
- Effort is needed to make it easier to navigate.
- Some examples for different kinds of skills
    - Issues can be raised and pull request submitted for review at the github repository. 
    - The GTN provides integrated tutorials on using Galaxy, and technical capacity building training material, such as on server administration, and on making GTN tutorials. Infrastructure for slides narrated in multiple languages, and hands-on tutorials applying real Galaxy tools to real data are supported.
    - The IUC provides best practice guidance and GTN training modules to help developers build new tool wrappers for Galaxy, and automated infrastructure to help maintain them efficiently.
    - GGSC offers opportunities for motivated community members to initiate and lead community development collaborations that can help the project to expand into activities that help support and expand subcommunities of users.
    - Working groups provide opportunities for the contribution of technical and other skills in focussed project areas ranging from GUI development through to training and outreach.

- In the past, many community members have become highly valued contributors by finding their own particular way to join in.

- More recently, effort is being devoted to documenting and clarifying the process, to make it far easier to navigate, for all kinds of contributors. 

- This training module is part of that effort and there is a separate module on contributor pathways and stories to help show how many useful contributions have been made.
