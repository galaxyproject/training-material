> Most of the material in this exercise is covered in the quick 5' introductory video, so this exercise is not going to work as well if you start it after watching it. Best to start here, then work through the material, where the video will serve as an introduction to the entire Topic.

We are not (yet) aware of evidence of benefit (or harm) arising from completing this exercise, but we hope you enjoy and gain something from it anyway. Feedback really is helpful for training modules.

# An exercise to consolidate the material and reinforce your learning.

Please take a few minutes to complete the first step of the following exercise *before* continuing with the lessons in this training topic. This exercise may be more helpful for those relatively new to the project, because much detail about Galaxy's scope, opportunities and impact on open science, are not yet widely understood, even among researchers who routinely use Galaxy. 


> <details-title>Exercise explanation</details-title>
>
> This exercise is designed to help consolidate the contents in your memory, through a structured, immediate post-learning review, comparing your understanding before, and then shortly after you have completed it on a few of the core learning objectives. It may also help you to clarify how well this material succeeded in meeting your particular learning style and needs.
>
> Below are some not uncommon assertions about the Galaxy project, containing a mix of truthiness and misunderstanding. Summarising your response to each assertion briefly *before* reading the training material can be used as a post-reading review. For each assertion, indicate, in a sentence or two, which aspects are mostly true and why other aspects are mostly false. 
>
> *After* reading all the parts of this material you are interested in, review each of the responses you prepared, to clarify how your views have changed. There are no "correct" answers, but the review may help you to consolidate and clarify the material. 
>
> The last step is to reflect on the process of learning, and how well the material supported your needs. If you have suggestions to make the material more useful for future readers, please contribute them as feedback. That helps improve the training material, so is a useful contribution.

## Step 1

Take a few minutes (at most), to write a short response to each of the following propositions, based on what you already know about the Galaxy project. 

1. Galaxy is an open source project, so most project activities involve the source code repository.
2. Domain-specific scientific or other kinds of knowledge and skills are not useful for contributing to the project, unless you also have software engineering skills.
3. Galaxy is only suitable for analysing commodity sequencing data in biology.
4. Galaxy is free, open source, so it must be unstable, buggy, poorly supported and not usable at scale.
5. Galaxy "usegalaxy.*" analysis services are free, so they must be unreliable, buggy, poorly supported and of no use for any real research.
6. The project is too big for any new collaborators or contributors.
7. It is hard to learn to use Galaxy, because it is open source, so it must be poorly documented.
8. Galaxy is supported by a research grant, so all project activities are controlled by the institution managing the grant.

When you have finished, store your responses, so you can use them to complete the exercise when you have read as much of the training material as you need.

## Step 2

Read the [intoductory material](../introduction/tutorial.html), and then work through the remaining material in this training topic at your own pace.

## Step 3

When you have finished reading, take a few moments to review your responses from Step 1. Take note of where your views on each assertion were changed as a result of reading this material. This should help clarify and consolidate the new material you have encountered.

## Step 4

After completing a quick learning review, take a minute to reflect on how the material served *your* particular learning needs. There are likely to be changes that would have helped you to understand and use the material more easily, because this training material is surprisingly hard to create and we need all the help we can get from the community. Gaining insight into your own preferred learning style, can help focus your approach to lifelong learning, so this is a win-win proposition, Give us your suggestions as feedback, through the built in mechanisms at the end of each lesson. In that way you can make your contribution to the project - perhaps the first of many.

So, to summarise: When you have completed step 1, please continue by reading the introduction and then the remaining modules, then review your responses and if possible, provide feedback on your learning experience.
