title: "4: Galaxy project outputs"
summary: "Deliverables part of the field guide. Work in progress. Please help make it better?"
questions:
  - "What are the main identifiable project components?"
  - "How do they all fit together?"
  - "Who pays for the 'free' analysis computational resources?"
  - "How are decisions really made?"
  - "Who's in charge?"
  - "Why is contribution from the community so important?"
  - "How can I join in?"
objectives:
  - "Understand Galaxy community development stories as examples of how things get done"
  - "Understand how different communities work together to make things happen"
  - "Understand opportunities for engagement and contributing your skills"
 
time_estimation:
subtopic: anatomy
key_points:
  - "Galaxy is a complicated, participatory self-governing collaborative community project"
  - "Participants engage with the project on their own individual terms"
  - "Multiple perspectives and opinions are needed to see the whole interacting structure"
  - "Vision: Build hard features like reproducibility into an analysis framework with pluggable tools"
  - "Running code as a free service provides effective stress testing for software defects and useability"
  - "Project depends on and collaborates as part of the open science ecosystem"
  - "Started in genomics but now adapted to suit many data rich disciplines"
  - "New contributors and investigators are highly valued and warmly welcomed"

> - Work in progress!! First draft to try to get a structure to make sense.
> - Needs many contributors to make it useful. What would you like to have known, when you first tried getting things done in Galaxy?
> Please add what's missing and fix what's broken. Headings are mostly stubs waiting to be edited and extended 
> - Trying to describe the big picture will necessarily be big. Will probably need to break this already very wordy module into separate parts.
> - Add your story or stories to the stories tutorial too please!
> - Ross has strong opinions. 
> - Many of them are probably wrong but he doesn't know which ones yet. 
> - Please feel free to contribute your own, to make this more useful to future readers.

> <comment-title>Note to readers</comment-title>
> - This module introduces the most important parts of the Galaxy project. They are grouped arbitrarily and there are many overlaps, because Galaxy grows organically through collaborations, rather than by design.
> - The project continues to expand rapidly, so this module will need updating regularly
> - The Hub provides much more detail about many of the same structures and their activities, but this material is designed to provide simplified views of the project, so the Hub becomes easier to navigate.
> - This is an attempt at a kind of field guide to the ecosystem generating those Hub activities, for the use of participants trying to navigate it.

# 3. Project Deliverables

- Most visible parts of the project to researchers using Galaxy for analyses
- Made possible by all the people and the resources
- Downstream products of Galaxy are important but hard to quantify
    - Increased productivity in open science analysis
    - Improved trustworthiness of sharable, replicable computation for analyses.
    - Scientific discovery

## Source code

- Generic analysis framework
- Utilities - planemo etc
- Your ideas here please?

## Tool wrappers to "flavour" framework instances

- +8k tools in public toolshed
- Your ideas here please?

## Free analysis services

- usegalaxy.*
- Large Australian, European and US research infrastructure allocations
- Tens of thousands of users
- Professional user support
- Stress testing framework code and tools
- Your ideas here please?

## Capacity building: training resources and services

Providing training to build community capacity is an essential activity for the project, to ensure long term sustainability. 

 - User training integrated directly into the Galaxy user interface makes it easier for new users to become productive quickly. 
 - Training system administrators helps support the public usegalaxy.* and the many private servers that operate in academic and commercial laboratories. 
 - Training for external developers makes it easier for them to contribute efficiently, improving Galaxy code and creating new tools.
- The Galaxy Trainng Network (GTN) is central to building community capability.
- Offers free training to enhance global open science research capacity.
    - Generic aspects of using Galaxy for new users
    - Specific kinds of analyses with common types of open data.
    - System administrators are key to running reliable framework services
    - Software developers can contribute more efficiently with appropriate training
    - Trainers can learn how to prepare material for new GTN topics
- Your ideas here please?

## Downstream: repeatable open science analyses

- Most important and probably largest deliverable
- 10k+ publications
- Tens of thousands of scientists trained
- Your ideas here please?
