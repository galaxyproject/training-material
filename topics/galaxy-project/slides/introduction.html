### Work in Progress! This is far from complete - please add what's missing and help fix what's broken

## Introduction: Purpose of this training material

- Galaxy is a complex open science project and community.
- Growth from new collaborations increases project complexity.
- Hub web site provides much more detail about the project and activities.
- Can be overwhelming at first.
- This material summarises major components of the project 
- In the form of a field guide.
    - Maps of the major components and their interactions
    - Leadership stories of how project activities were started
- Many perspectives help understand the project.
- Seeing the whole project makes it easier to find ways to participate


???

- Galaxy is a big and complicated project.
- Many different kinds of engagement are possible.
- Finding your way in this large project can be hard at first.
- This module is a participant's field guide to the ecosystem.
- There are descriptive maps and stories of Leadership.
- To Guide those wanting to join in and support project activities.

## Origins: The context in which Galaxy was created

- In 2006, a flood of commodity sequencing data began to appear
- Disrupting much biology and many budgets
- Capable bioinformaticians were in short supply
- Fragile, unreliable analyses were built under intense pressure to publish expensive data
- Independent computational replication of a result was usually infeasible
- Data generation had overwhelmed available capacity to analyse it reliably
- Other data rich disciplines faced the same critical shortages of reliable analytic capacity 

???

- The context in which Galaxy originated, in 2006, helps explain a lot.
- Molecular biology was growing rapidly and delivering valuable insights
- Sequencing was expensive and new to biologists
- Investigators were impatient for results to publish from their expensive data.
- Reliable analysis requires solving many technical problems correctly. 
- Hasty solutions are likely to produce unreliable outputs.
- If the analysis cannot be scrutinised, the results cannot gain scientific trust.
- Galaxy was our response to this growing scientific crisis

---

## Solution: Accessible analysis using shareable and repeatable computation.

- Integrate sharing and computational reproducibility into a generic analysis framework.
- XML wrapper turns any Linux command line package into an interoperable tool
- Wrapped packages gain framework benefits, such as workflow inter-operability
- ToolShed repository automates tool wrapper installation for server administrators.
- "Flavour" each framework instance with specific tools to suit the needs of local users.
- Adaptable to any kind of open science 

???

- Galaxy was created as a solution to these growing problems.
- To make open science analyses accessible, reproducible and transparent.
- By building those core functionions into every analysis and output.
- Solve those hard challenges once by building a generic analysis application.
- Accommodate any open source analysis package, to suit any scientist.
- Make it easy to create and add tools to the generic framework.
- Each tool combination creates a user-specific analysis platform "flavour".
- Local users see only that selection of tools for their specific needs.

## Free analysis services drive software quality improvement and scientific value

- Since 2006, the Galaxy project has deployed the source code on real hardware.
- Providing free, reliable analysis services and storage for anyone, anywhere.
- Increasingly heavy use provides realistic, non-stop software stress testing
- Users contribute insight and experience to improve functionality
- Independent developers contribute improvements and help fix bugs
- Reliable software engineering practices are encouraged by heavy use at scale

???

- Galaxy code was available in 2006.
- An innovative analysis service running that code was also provided.
- It quickly attracted users collaborators and research grant support.
- Running the code as a free and highly reliable service is an impressive feat.
- Tens of thousands of scientists use it every day now.
- Thoroughly stress tested.
- Highly responsive to real world user feedback.

## Organic, collaborative growth driven by increasing value to scientists

- Reliable, free analysis services rapidly attracted users and contributors.
- New interacting grants have joined and extended the project, such as the GTN
- Open shared values make it easier to collaborate efficiently.
- Scientists benefit from easy access to reliable complex analyses and training
- Hundreds of community participants also regularly contribute their skills and ideas.



???

- Galaxy continues to grow rapidly, because scientists value it highly
- New collaborations are encouraged
- They bring new capabilities and new user communities
- Organic self-governed growth has brought increasing complexity and diversity
- Shared values help maintain engagement, coherence and stability
- Contributor engagement is vital to growth and sustainability in Open projects

## Today

- Self governed, multi-investigator global collaboration.
- Framework source code is the core deliverable 
- Free analysis services and training resources use project source code
- Running on very large scale allocations of research computing infrastructure.
- Free, highly reliable analysis services for anyone, anywhere.
- Tens of thousands of scientists rely on it for analyses each day
- 8000+ interoperable open source analysis packages as tools in the toolshed
- Galaxy Training Network provides integrated training resources and capacity building services.
- Adopted by data rich communities such as climate science, ecology, proteomics.
- Other tutorials in this training module provide stories and field guides.

???

- Today, Galaxy is a self-governing collaborative community with a shared mission
- Supporting open science, by making reproducible and transparent analyses easy.
- Framework source code is the core of the mission.
- "Free" services add enormous value to the code for scientists.
- Describing how all the pieces fit together is a challenge
- Best practice analysis toolkits and workflows can be built.
- New areas of science and new collaborators are welcomed.

## How does the project operate and sustain itself?

- Galaxy code runs at scale to provide "free" services
    - Open training and reliable complex analyses.
    - Collaborating grants provide the substantial resources needed
- A large, open collaboration supports these and other services for the project
    - Many institutions are involved, but none of them run the project.
    - The collaboration is managed by participatory self-governance.
    - It is a large and complex community and enterprise.
- There are open working groups where most of the actual work is done.
- Skilled participant contributions help the project grow, improve and remain sustainable.
- It is always encouraged and supported
- Making it as easy as possible for participants is an ongoing effort 


???

- Most open source code projects are sustained with very low direct costs.
- Galaxy's free analysis services are highly valued by scientists.
- They consume substantial, expensive computational infrastructure resources.
- Dedicated professionals are needed to keep them running reliably.
- Those resources are provided through multiple collaborating grants.
- Community engagement and contribution are highly valued and encouraged.
- Participants drive improvement, expansion and long term sustainability.
