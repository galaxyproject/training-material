# Work in Progress! Contributions and fixes welcomed.

## Introduction: Purpose of this Topic

- Galaxy is a global open science collaboration and community.
- It provides source code, and free analysis and other services running that code.
- The Hub web site provides detail about the project and activities.
- This is (at present) a personal perspective - it had to start somewhere.
- This topic provides a field guide to a complex project ecosystem.
    - Maps of the major components, and their interactions
    - Stories about how project collaborations and activities came about.
- Many opinions and personal perspectives are needed.
- Seeing the bigger picture makes it easier to navigate.


???

- Galaxy is a big and complicated project, providing highly valued open science resources.
- Complexity offers opportunities for different kinds of engagement.
- Finding your way is hard at first, because there is so much activity.
- This video introduces a field guide to the project ecosystem.
- There are descriptive maps, and stories about how new initiatives began.
- No single perspective can cover all the complexities.
- For individuals who want to navigate and understand the project.

## Origins: The context in which Galaxy was created

- In 2005, there was a growing flood of commodity sequencing data.
- Disrupting much biology and many budgets.
- Experienced bioinformaticians were in short supply in biology laboratories.
- Fragile, unreliable analyses were run, under intense pressure to publish expensive data rapidly.
- Independent scrutiny, or computational replication of a result was usually infeasible
- Scientific trust is built by transparency, scrutiny and replication.
- All data rich disciplines faced the same critical shortage of reliable analytic capacity
- An open, generic solution would help avoid redundant technical effort for every analysis.

???

- The context in which Galaxy originated, in two thousand and five, helps explain a lot.
- Sequencing was expensive, but provided valuable scientific insights.
- Technical skills needed to analyse raw data correctly, were in very short supply
- Investigators were impatient for results to publish from expensive data.
- If an analysis cannot be scrutinised, the results cannot gain scientific trust.
- Galaxy was our response to this growing shortfall in reliable analysis capacity.
- A scalable solution for transparent analysis in any field.

---

## Solution: An application for accessible transparent analysis.

- Galaxy was designed as a solution to the growing need for reliable, shareable analysis.
- Integrate sharing and computational reproducibility into a generic analysis framework.
- XML "wrapper" turns any Linux command line package into an installable tool
- Wrapped packages gain framework benefits, such as workflow interoperability
- ToolShed repository automates tool wrapper installation for server administrators.
- Many "Flavours" are available, to make a framework instance match the needs of local users.
- Adaptable to any kind of open science data where packages are available to wrap.

???

- Galaxy was created to make open science analyses, reproducible and transparent.
- Solve all those tough challenges once, in a generic scientific workflow application.
- Build those core scientific requirements into every analysis and output.
- Accommodate any command line analysis package, making it an accessible and interoperable tool.
- Make it easy to wrap and install analysis packages as tools, into the generic framework.
- Framework flavour, such as Public Health, or Muon Science, depends on the installed tools.
- The analysis needs of any field, can be satisfied, by creating a suitable set of tools.

## Free analysis services drive software quality improvement and scientific value

- Galaxy source code has been running on real hardware since 2005, as part of the solution.
- Providing free, reliable analysis services and storage for anyone, anywhere.
- Increasingly heavy use provides realistic, non-stop software stress testing
- Users contribute insight and experience to improve functionality
- Independent developers contribute improvements and help fix bugs
- Reliable software engineering practices are encouraged by heavy use at scale

???

- Galaxy's free analysis services have been available since two thousand and five.
- It was highly innovative, and quickly attracted users, collaborators, and research grant support.
- Running a free, and heavily used service, provides thorough field testing, for the project source code.
- Tens of thousands of scientists generate bug reports, user feedback, and ideas for improvement.
- Community contributors provide bug fixes, ideas, and code improvements.
- This maintains robust code, and provides increasing value to users over time.

---


## Success driven by collaborations that increase value to scientists

- Reliable code powering free analysis services provides many opportunities for collaboration.
- Investigators joining the collaboration, such as the GTN, extend and enhance the whole project.
- Open collaborations grow organically, as opportunities arise, rather than by design.
- Open shared values make it possible for large collaborations to function efficiently.
- Scientists benefit from easy access to reliable complex analyses and training
- Hundreds of community participants regularly contribute their skills and ideas.

???

- Galaxy continues to grow rapidly, because scientists value it highly
- Encouraging new collaborations, brings new capabilities, and new user communities
- Organic, self governed growth, produces increasing complexity and diversity
- Shared open source community values help maintain engagement, coherence, and stability
- Scientists gain free access to resources that they value highly in their work.
- Contributor engagement drives growth and sustainability, in Open projects

## The Galaxy project is much more than an open source code repository

- Open source projects maintain public code repositories and provide support to end users.
- Galaxy does that, but also runs project code 24x7, at scale, providing high availability services.
- These "free" services depend on resources and effort provided by a global, self-governing community.
- Participant contributions improve and sustain the resulting value to open science practice.

???

- An open source repository on Github can be maintained without direct costs.
- High reliability analysis services need dedicated staff and costly computational infrastructure, provided by collaborators.
- Sustaining a global self-governing community and collaboration requires dedicated resources.
- Support from the community multiplies the impact of core grant resources, providing additional benefit to scientists.

## Communities help sustain the project.

- Sustainability may be of interest, if the project is useful or important to your work.
- Community engagement and participation are the main drivers of project improvement and success.
- Project activities add value to code, by supporting diverse kinds of science. 
- Open communities govern themselves, to make engagement a rewarding experience.
- Encouraging many different kinds of skills, experience and ideas to be contributed.
- Other Lesson modules in this Topic describe project components, processes and structures. 
- Designed to help participants navigate and engage with the project.
- Open projects succeed when they offer sufficient value to attract real support from communities.
- Please let us know of anything that would make this material more useful.

???

- If you depend on Galaxy, you may want to help improve and sustain it.
- Engagement, participation and collaboration are core open project values.
- Shared values keep project work environments safe and welcoming.
- Project complexity offers a multitude of opportunities for participation.
- Lessons with more detail on structures and processes are part of this Topic.
- You are invited to explore to find your own way to engage and contribute.
- Support reproducible and trustworthy analyses for all open science researchers.
- For example, community feedback improves these open training resources for everyone.
