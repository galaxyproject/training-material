# Introduction: Why, who and what is this training material for?

- If you've found Galaxy useful, you might wonder who runs it and why
    - Briefly, it is an open self-governing collaboration driven by shared values
    - This module will expand substantially on that explanation.
    - In particular, showing how the *open self-governing* part means *participants help run it*.
- It can be hard to see how things get done
- Even harder to identify contribution opportunities and pathways
- This training material provides several aspects of the big picture
    - Descriptive maps of the major components
    - Leadership stories telling how novel project activities were created
- A kind of field guide to the project ecosystem
- For those trying to navigate it and join in


???

- Participation is a major driver of Galaxy's success
- Success has resulted in rapid growth and increased complexity
- Complexity offers opportunities for many kinds of participation
- It also offers challenges for those trying to navigate it
- This material is designed to provide maps and stories to help participants find their own ways in

# Context was 2006, in the growing sequence data Tsunami

- Galaxy was created in response to a crisis in computational reliability.
- Genome sequencing was disrupting much biological research and many budgets
- Capable bioinformaticians were in short supply
- Each new experiment usually required novel code
- Version control and automated testing were rare
- Fragile, potentially unreliable analyses were not uncommon
- Independent computational replication of a result was usually infeasible
- Data generation had overwhelmed available capacity to analyse it reliably
- All data rich disciplines faced the same critical shortage 
- Science depends on scrutiny and replication to build trust in any result.

???

- Time-travel back to complex scientific analyses in 2006 for a moment
- Molecular biology is growing rapidly and delivering valuable insights
- Sequencing is expensive and new to biologists trying to use it
- Solutions to technical challenges in analysis are not always well engineered

---

# Motivation for the project

- Every researcher had to reinvent the same analysis pipelines independently.
- Waste of their time to overcome technological problems.
- Sharing or scrutiny, let alone reproducibility were almost always impossible
- Without scrutiny, "black box" analysis code has no established scientific trustworthiness
- Scientific trustworthiness comes from scrutiny of transparent and reproducible results
- Transparency and computational reproducibility are non-trivial challenges
- Best solved once and used often because it is a big investment in effort to generalise. 


???

- Science depends on transparency and reproducibility of results
- Transparent and reproducible computation requires overcoming many practical and technical challenges
- Doing that work once as the basis for a generic analysis framework, is an efficient solution.
- A small research collaboration grew around that vision, and Galaxy is the result.

---

# Vision: Make every analysis transparent and repeatable

- Integrate generic functionality like computational replication into a generic analysis framework.
- XML wrapper turns any Linux command line package into an interoperable tool
- Wrapped packages gain framework benefits, such as workflow interoperability for matching datatypes
- XML isolates framework from all technical complexities in third party open source packages.
- ToolShed repository automates tool wrapper installation for server administrators.
- "Flavour" each framework server with plug-in tools chosen to suit local users
- Web accessible with built in training so users can quickly become productive.
- Automate shareable, replicable analyses without technical friction
- Adapatable to complex data rich analyses for any kind of open science

Generic design allows XML to make

# Free analysis services as a driver of software value

- Since 2006, the Galaxy project has deployed the source code on real hardware.
- Providing free, reliable analysis services for anyone, anywhere.
- Increasingly heavy use provides free realistic software stress testing
- Users contribute valuable insight and experience to improve platform feature functionality
- Developers start to contribute improvements and help fix bugs
- Reliable software engineering is driven by real world use at scale.

???

- In 2006, Galaxy was innovative.
- It quickly attracted users, collaborators and research grant support.
- Running the code as a free, global, reliable 24/7 service is an impressive feat
- Tens of thousands of scientists use it every day so the code is thoroughly tested in use.
- A community of contributors make all this sustainable with a small dedicated professional team.

# Organic growth

- Reliable, free service rapidly attracted users, contributors and collaborators.
- Live demonstrations of new features are still highly regarded as theatre sports at meetings.
- Has grown into a global self-governing project
- Based on shared values and enduring relationships
- Network of interacting grants that support source code and many other services
- Communities of contributors add their own skills and ideas to improve the project
- Contributor engagement remains vital to open project growth and sustainability

# Today

- Self governed, multi-investigator global collaboration.
- Framework source code is the core deliverable 
- Free analysis services and training resources use project source code
- Running on very large scale allocations of research computing infrastructure.
- Free, highly reliable analysis services for anyone, anywhere still, but now much bigger
- 8000+ interoperable open source analysis packages as tools in the toolshed
- Used in many data rich sciences such as climate science, ecology, proteomics.
- Open to anyone who wants to apply their skills to help democratise open science analyses
- So big and complicated that describing how all the bits fit together is a challenge.
- Few individuals with enough time to engage in all the activities of the project components.


???

- Today, it is a self-governing, global open science collaboration, that not only maintains, but also adds value to the core framework source code, by delivering popular open science resources including free analysis services with integrated training material.

# How does the project operate

- Collaboration between independent investigators provides many of the resources for the project
- Many other regular contributors also play important roles as collaborators.
- The core open source repository has hundreds of external developers contributing improvements. 
- Around that, are numerous independent grants and research computing allocations
- Many institutions are involved, but none of them run the project.
- The whole collaborative effort is run by participatory open governance
- There are open working groups where most of the actual work is done
- Community contribution is a key component for the sustainability and growth of the project
- So it is strongly encouraged and made as easy as possible for newcomers. 

???

- Community engagement, contribution and collaboration have always been welcomed and encouraged, because these drive improvement, expansion and long term sustainability for open science projects.

- Some Galaxy project activities, such as the source code and the free usegalaxy.* analysis services, are widely appreciated and heavily used. 

- These are the most obvious parts of the project, but they are made possible and supported by a much larger and complicated ecosystem of interacting and collaborating activities.
