### Work in Progress! This is far from complete - please add what's missing and help fix what's broken

## Introduction: Purpose of this training module

- Community participation is the major driver of Galaxy's success
- Success has resulted in rapid growth and increased complexity
- There are many accurate but different ways of seeing the big picture
    - Vision, values shared by participants
    - Maps of the major components and their interactions
    - Leadership stories of how project activities were started
- The Hub web site provides access to current detail about project activities
- This material summarises the major components that support those activities
- Both are needed to understand the project and to participate efficiently


???
- Galaxy has developed into a sprawling open science project and community
- The collaboration is so complicated that it needs a field guide
- Many different kinds of engagement are possible
- Challenging for those trying to find their way in
- This material is designed to provide maps and stories
- Practical guidance for those wanting to help make the project better.
- The way Galaxy began explains a lot, so let's go back for a moment.

## Origins: The context in which Galaxy was created

- In 2006, a rising flood of commodity sequencing data created a reliability crisis in analysis.
- Genome sequencing disrupted much biology and many budgets
- Capable bioinformaticians were in short supply
- Fragile, unreliable analyses were built under intense pressure to publish expensive data
- Independent computational replication of a result was usually infeasible
- Data generation had overwhelmed available capacity to analyse it reliably
- Other data rich disciplines faced the same critical shortages of reliable analytic capacity 

???

- Time-travel back to 2006 for a moment
- Molecular biology was growing rapidly and delivering valuable insights
- Sequencing was expensive and new to biologists trying to use it
- Investigators demanded results to publish as soon as expensive data arrives.
- Doing that reliably required overcoming very substantial technical challenges 
- Hasty solutions may produce unreliable outputs.
- If the analysis cannot be scrutinised, the results cannot gain scientific trust.
- Galaxy was our response to this growing scientific crisis

---

## Research productivity and scientific trustworthiness in crisis

- Each researcher reinvented the same analysis pipelines since they were not easily shared.
- Biologists learned to overcome computational technical problems for themselves
- Many creative solutions were unreliable and not well engineered.
- Sharing or scrutiny, let alone reproducibility were almost always impossible
- Scientific trustworthiness comes from scrutiny of transparent and reproducible results

???

- Trust in scientific results depends on transparency and reproducibility
- Many technical challenges must be overcome to support reproducible analyses
- The substantial investment needed can be part of adaptable analysis software. 
- Every scientist doing it for themselves for every analysis, is very inefficient
- Analyses that cannot be reproduced or examined are "black boxes" of unknown trustworthiness


---

## Solution: Accessible analysis using intrinsically shareable and repeatable computation

- Integrate sharing and computational reproducibility into a generic analysis framework.
- XML wrapper turns any Linux command line package into an interoperable tool
- Wrapped packages gain framework benefits, such as workflow inter-operability
- XML decouples framework from all technical complexities of thousands of tool packages.
- ToolShed repository automates tool wrapper installation for server administrators.
- "Flavour" each framework instance with specific tools to suit the needs of local users.
- Adaptable to any kind of open science 

???

- Can we make every possible analysis reproducible and reliable?
- Asking scientists to do it for themselves for every analysis is very inefficient.
- Better to solve those hard challenges once and build it in an adaptable analysis environment
- Do it once, and do it right.
- Add an accessible analysis user interface.
- A framework to accommodate any open source analysis packages to suit any scientist
- Tools plug into the framework to provide whatever analysis packages local users need.

## Free analysis services drive software quality improvement and scientific value

- Since 2006, the Galaxy project has deployed the source code on real hardware.
- Providing free, reliable analysis services and storage for anyone, anywhere.
- Increasingly heavy use provides realistic, non-stop software stress testing
- Users contribute valuable insight and experience to improve platform feature functionality
- Developers start to contribute improvements and help fix bugs
- Reliable software engineering practices are encouraged by real world use at scale

???

- By 2006 Galaxy code was available
- The project offered an innovative analysis service running that code.
- It quickly attracted users collaborators and research grant support.
- Running the code as a free and reliable service was and remains an impressive feat
- Tens of thousands of scientists use it every day now.
- So the code is thoroughly stress tested in use.

## Organic, collaborative growth driven by increasing value to scientists

- Reliable, free analysis services rapidly attracted users, contributors and collaborators.
- Live demonstrations of new features are still highly regarded as theatre sports at meetings.
- Has grown into a global self-governing community
- Based on shared values and enduring relationships
- Network of interacting grants that support source code and many other services
- Contributors add their skills and ideas to help support and improve the project


???

- Providing real value to scientists is the main driver for Galaxy's success
- New collaborations are encouraged to bring new capabilities and new user communities
- Growth brings complexity and diversity
- Shared values help maintain engagement, coherence and stability
- Contributor engagement remains vital to open project growth and sustainability

## Today

- Self governed, multi-investigator global collaboration.
- Framework source code is the core deliverable 
- Free analysis services and training resources use project source code
- Running on very large scale allocations of research computing infrastructure.
- Free, highly reliable analysis services for anyone, anywhere still, but now much bigger
- 8000+ interoperable open source analysis packages as tools in the toolshed
- Galaxy Training Network provides integrated training resources and capacity building services
- Adopted by data rich communities such as climate science, ecology, proteomics.


???

- A self-governing, global open science community
- Collaborations maintain and enhance core source code repositories
- Collaborations also support "free" services that add value to the code
- Such as analysis services, integrated training resources and the ToolShed 
- So big and complicated that describing how all the bits fit together is a challenge.
- Few individuals with enough time to engage in all the activities of the project components.
- Open to anyone who wants to apply their skills

## How does the project operate and sustain itself?

- Galaxy runs the code at scale, supporting open analysis and training services.
- These are free to users, because those resources are provided by grants.
- A large, open collaboration supports these and other services for the project
- Many institutions are involved, but none of them run the project.
- The collaboration is managed by participatory self-governance, as a large and complex community
- There are open working groups where most of the actual work is done
- Skilled participant contributions help the project grow, improve and remain sustainable.
- It is always encouraged and supported
- Making it as easy as possible for participants is an ongoing effort 


???

- Open source projects provide source code and documentation
- Minimal cost to run, with free infrastructure like github.
- Galaxy's analysis services are highly valued, and heavily used, by scientists
- They consume substantial computational infrastructure, and require dedicated professional resources.
- The most widely used products of the project
- Part of the project ecosystem of collaborating people, resources and deliverables. 
- Community engagement, contribution and collaboration have always been welcomed
- Participants drive improvement, expansion and long term sustainability.
