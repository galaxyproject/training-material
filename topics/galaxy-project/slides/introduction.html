### Work in Progress! This is far from complete - please add what's missing and help fix what's broken

## Introduction: Purpose of this training material

- Galaxy is a complex open science project and community.
- Growth from new collaborations increases project complexity.
- Hub web site provides much more detail about the project and activities.
- This material summarises major components of the project 
- In the form of a field guide.
    - Maps of the major components and their interactions
    - Leadership stories of how project activities were started
- Many perspectives help understand the project.
- Seeing the bigger picture should help make it easier to find ways to participate


???

- Galaxy is a big and complicated project.
- Complexity offers opportunities for different kinds of engagement.
- Finding your way on the Hub can be hard at first.
- This module is a participant's field guide to the ecosystem.
- There are descriptive maps and stories of Leadership.
- No single perspective can cover all project complexities.
- For those wanting to join in and support project activities.

## Origins: The context in which Galaxy was created

- In 2006, a flood of commodity sequencing data began to appear
- Disrupting much biology and many budgets
- Capable bioinformaticians were in short supply
- Fragile, unreliable analyses were built under intense pressure to publish expensive data rapidly.
- Independent computational replication of a result was usually infeasible
- Scientific trust is built by transparency, scrutiny and replication.
- Data generation overwhelmed capacity to analyse it reliably
- Other data rich disciplines faced the same critical shortages of reliable analytic capacity 

???

- The context in which Galaxy originated, in 2006, helps explain a lot.
- Sequencing was expensive but provided valuable insights.
- Technical skills required to analyse it correctly were in very short supply
- Investigators were impatient for results to publish from their expensive data.
- If the analysis cannot be scrutinised, the results cannot gain scientific trust.
- Galaxy was our response to this growing shortfall in reliable analysis.
- Not just a crisis in genome sciences, but in all other growing data rich fields.

## Solution: Accessible analysis using shareable and repeatable computation.

- Galaxy was created as a solution to these growing problems.
- Integrate sharing and computational reproducibility into a generic analysis framework.
- XML wrapper turns any Linux command line package into an interoperable tool
- Wrapped packages gain framework benefits, such as workflow inter-operability
- ToolShed repository automates tool wrapper installation for server administrators.
- "Flavour" each framework instance with specific tools to suit the needs of local users.
- Adaptable to any kind of open science 

???


- Galaxy was created to make open science analyses reproducible and transparent.
- Solve those hard challenges with a generic reproducible analysis application.
- Build those core scientific requirements into every analysis and output.
- Accommodate any open source analysis package, to suit any scientist.
- Make it easy to create and add tools to the generic framework.
- Each tool combination creates a user-specific analysis platform "flavour".
- Local users see only that selection of tools for their specific needs.

## Free analysis services drive software quality improvement and scientific value

- Since 2006, the Galaxy project has deployed the source code on real hardware.
- Providing free, reliable analysis services and storage for anyone, anywhere.
- Increasingly heavy use provides realistic, non-stop software stress testing
- Users contribute insight and experience to improve functionality
- Independent developers contribute improvements and help fix bugs
- Reliable software engineering practices are encouraged by heavy use at scale

???

- Galaxy code was available in 2006.
- An innovative analysis service running that code was also supported.
- It quickly attracted users collaborators and research grant support.
- Running the code as a free and highly reliable service is an impressive feat.
- Tens of thousands of scientists use it every day now.
- Thoroughly stress tested.
- Highly responsive to real world user feedback.

## Organic, collaborative growth driven by increasing value to scientists

- Reliable, free analysis services rapidly attracted users and contributors.
- New interacting grants have joined and extended the project, such as the GTN
- Growth is organic and self-regulating.
- Open shared values make it easier for large scale collaborations to function efficiently.
- Scientists benefit from easy access to reliable complex analyses and training
- Hundreds of community participants also regularly contribute their skills and ideas.



???

- Galaxy continues to grow rapidly, because scientists value it highly
- Encouraging new collaborations brings new capabilities and new user communities
- Organic self-governed growth has brought increasing complexity and diversity
- Shared values help maintain engagement, coherence and stability
- Scientists gain free access to resources they value highly in their work.
- Contributor engagement is vital to growth and sustainability in Open projects

## Today

- Galaxy is a global, self governed, multi-investigator collaboration.
- Framework source code is the core deliverable to support open science analysis
- Free analysis services and training resources use project source code
- Highly reliable analysis services for anyone, anywhere.
- Tens of thousands of scientists rely on it for analyses each day
- 8000+ interoperable open source analysis packages as tools in the toolshed
- Adopted by data rich communities such as climate science, ecology, proteomics.
- Other tutorials in this training module provide stories and a field guide.

???

- Today, Galaxy is a self-governing collaborative community with a shared mission
- Supporting open science, by making reproducible and transparent analyses easy.
- "Free" services using that code add value for researchers.
- Supporting analyses for tens of thousands of scientists every day.
- Thousands of ready to run tools are available from the ToolShed.
- "Best practice" analysis toolkits can be built from existing open source packages.
- Describing how all the pieces fit together is a challenge addressed by other parts of this material

## How does the project operate and sustain itself?

- Project runs the code at scale to provide "free" services
- A large, open collaboration supports these and other services for the project
    - Many institutions are involved, but none of them run the project.
    - The collaboration is managed by participatory self-governance.
    - It is a large and complex community and enterprise.
- Skilled participant contributions help the project grow, improve and remain sustainable.
- Open projects encourage and support engagement by users and developers.
- Making it as easy as possible for participants to join in, is an ongoing effort 


???

- Maintaining an open source code repository involve very small direct project costs.
- Galaxy's unusual free analysis services consume substantial and expensive computational infrastructure and dedicated professional effort to keep them running.
- Those resources are provided through multiple collaborating grants.
- Community engagement and contribution are highly valued and encouraged.
- Participants drive improvement, expansion and long term sustainability.

## Where do you fit in?


- Community engagement and participation are the main driver of project success
- The Galaxy project is much more than a source code repository
- Opportunities to contribute many different kinds of skills are available
- Other training modules contain details about project components, processes and structures. 
- Participants can use that material to find ways to support our work
- Open projects can only succeed if they are supported by communities of users.

???
- Project growth and success depend on communities and participation
- Galaxy can benefit from all kinds of skills and ideas.
- Project complexity provides many different kinds of opportunities to participate.
- Additional modules offer training material describing the project in more detail.
- Please think about how you can help.
- Come and join us, and help support reliable analysis for open scientists
