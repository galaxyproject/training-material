### Work in Progress! This is far from complete - please add what's missing and help fix what's broken

## Introduction: Purpose of this Topic

- Galaxy is a complex open science project and community.
- Collaborating grants and community contributors add value to the core source code.
- The Hub web site provides detail about the project and activities.
- Lessons in this Topic provide an overview of the major components of the project 
- As a kind of field guide to a complex ecology.
    - Maps of the major components and their interactions
    - Stories about how individual project collaborations began
- Many perspectives are needed to understand the project.
- Seeing the bigger picture will make it easier to find interesting ways to participate


???

- Galaxy is a big and complicated project, built around the project open source code.
- Complexity offers opportunities for different kinds of engagement.
- It makes finding your way harder at first because there is a lot going on.
- This introduction is part of a field guide to the project ecosystem.
- There are descriptive maps, and stories about how new initiatives began.
- These are useful because no single perspective can cover all project complexities.
- For people wanting to find ways to join in and help support our mission.

## Origins: The context in which Galaxy was created

- In 2005, a growing flood of commodity sequencing data began to appear
- Disrupting much biology and many budgets
- Experienced bioinformaticians were in short supply in biology laboratories.
- Fragile, unreliable analyses were built under intense pressure to publish expensive data rapidly.
- Independent scrutiny or computational replication of a result was usually infeasible
- Scientific trust is built by transparency, scrutiny and replication.
- Data generation overwhelmed capacity to analyse it reliably
- Other data rich disciplines faced the same critical shortages of reliable analytic capacity 

???

- The context in which Galaxy originated, in two thousand and five, helps explain a lot.
- Sequencing was expensive but provided valuable insights.
- Technical skills needed to analyse raw data correctly were in very short supply
- Investigators were impatient for results to publish from expensive data.
- If the analysis cannot be scrutinised, the results cannot gain scientific trust.
- Galaxy was our response to this growing shortfall in reliable analysis.
- Not just a crisis in genome sciences, but in all other growing data rich fields.

## Solution: Accessible analysis using shareable and repeatable computation.

- Galaxy was created as a solution to these growing problems.
- Integrate sharing and computational reproducibility into a generic analysis framework.
- XML wrapper turns any Linux command line package into an interoperable tool
- Wrapped packages gain framework benefits, such as workflow inter-operability
- ToolShed repository automates tool wrapper installation for server administrators.
- "Flavour" each framework instance with specific tools to suit the needs of local users.
- Adaptable to any kind of open science 

???


- Galaxy was created to make open science analyses reproducible and transparent.
- Solve those hard challenges with a generic reproducible analysis application.
- Build those core scientific requirements into every analysis and output.
- Accommodate any open source analysis package, to suit any scientist.
- Make it easy to wrap and install new tools into that generic framework.
- Each framework instance acquires a flavour, when tools for specific analyses are installed.
- So the analysis needs of any field can be satisfied, by installing a matching set of tools.

## Free analysis services drive software quality improvement and scientific value

- Galaxy source code has been running on real hardware since the initial 2005 publication.
- Providing free, reliable analysis services and storage for anyone, anywhere.
- Increasingly heavy use provides realistic, non-stop software stress testing
- Users contribute insight and experience to improve functionality
- Independent developers contribute improvements and help fix bugs
- Reliable software engineering practices are encouraged by heavy use at scale

???

- An innovative analysis service running Galaxy code has been supported since 2005.
- It quickly attracted users collaborators and research grant support.
- Running the code as a free and highly reliable service is a thorough test of the code.
- Tens of thousands of scientists use it every day now.
- Providing feedback and ideas for improvement
- This helps maintain robust code and increasing value to users.

## Organic, collaborative growth driven by increasing value to scientists

- Reliable, free analysis services rapidly attracted users and contributors.
- New interacting grants have joined and extended the project, such as the GTN
- Growth is organic and self-regulating.
- Open shared values make it easier for large scale collaborations to function efficiently.
- Scientists benefit from easy access to reliable complex analyses and training
- Hundreds of community participants also regularly contribute their skills and ideas.



???

- Galaxy continues to grow rapidly, because scientists value it highly
- Encouraging new collaborations brings new capabilities and new user communities
- Organic self-governed growth has brought increasing complexity and diversity
- Shared values help maintain engagement, coherence and stability
- Scientists gain free access to resources they value highly in their work.
- Contributor engagement is vital to growth and sustainability in Open projects

## Today

- Galaxy is a global, self governed, multi-investigator collaboration.
- Framework source code is the core deliverable to support open science analysis
- Free analysis services and training resources use project source code
- Highly reliable analysis services for anyone, anywhere.
- Tens of thousands of scientists rely on it for analyses each day
- 8000+ interoperable open source analysis packages as tools in the toolshed
- Adopted by data rich communities such as climate science, ecology, proteomics.
- Other lessons in this Topic provide stories and a field guide.

???

- Today, Galaxy is a self-governing collaborative community with a shared mission
- Supporting open science, by making reproducible and transparent analyses easy.
- "Free" services using that code add value for researchers.
- Supporting analyses for tens of thousands of scientists every day.
- Thousands of ready to run tools are available from the ToolShed.
- "Best practice" analysis toolkits can be built from existing open source packages.
- Describing how all the pieces fit together is a challenge addressed by other parts of this material

## How does the project operate and sustain itself?

- Most open source projects only provide code and support to end users.
- Galaxy source is run at scale, to provide "free" services.
- A large, open collaboration supports these and other services for the project
    - Investigators and grants are from many different institutions.
    - The collaboration is managed by participatory self-governance.
    - It is a large and complex community and service enterprise.
- Skilled participant contributions help the project grow, improve and remain sustainable.
- Open projects encourage and support engagement by users and developers.
- Making it as easy as possible for participants to join in, is an ongoing effort 


???

- Running an open source code repository involves little direct project costs.
- Galaxy provides free analysis services that consume substantial and expensive computational infrastructure, and require highly skilled personnel, to keep them running.
- Those resources are supplied by multiple collaborating grants.
- Community engagement and collaborations are highly valued and encouraged.
- Participation drives improvement, expansion and long term sustainability.
