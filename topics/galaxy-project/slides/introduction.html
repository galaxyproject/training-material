- As a kind of field guide to a complex ecology.
    - Maps of the major components and their interactions
    - Stories about how individual project collaborations began
- Many perspectives are needed to understand the project.
- Seeing the bigger picture will make it easier to find interesting ways to participate


???

- Galaxy is a big and complicated project, supporting and adding value to core open source code.
- Complexity offers opportunities for different kinds of participant engagement.
- Complexity makes finding your way harder at first, because there is so much activity.
- This talk introduces our field guide, to the project ecosystem, for participants.
- There are descriptive maps, and stories about how new initiatives began.
- No single perspective can cover all the complexities.
- For individuals who want to find their own way to join in and help support our mission.

## Origins: The context in which Galaxy was created

- In 2005, there was a growing flood of commodity sequencing data.
- Disrupting much biology and many budgets.
- Experienced bioinformaticians were in short supply in biology laboratories.
- Fragile, unreliable analyses were run, under intense pressure to publish expensive data rapidly.
- Independent scrutiny, or computational replication of a result was usually infeasible
- Scientific trust is built by transparency, scrutiny and replication.
- Other data rich disciplines faced the same critical shortages of reliable analytic capacity 

???

- The context in which Galaxy originated, in two thousand and five, helps explain a lot.
- Sequencing was expensive, but provided valuable scientific insights.
- Technical skills needed to analyse raw data correctly, were in very short supply
- Investigators were impatient for results to publish from expensive data.
- If an analysis cannot be scrutinised, the results cannot gain scientific trust.
- Galaxy was our response to this growing shortfall in reliable analysis capacity.
- Not only in genome sciences, but a risk to scientific integrity in many rapidly growing, data-rich fields.

## Solution: Accessible analysis using shareable and repeatable computation.

- Galaxy was designed as a solution to the growing need for reliable, shareable analysis.
- Integrate sharing and computational reproducibility into a generic analysis framework.
- XML wrapper turns any Linux command line package into an interoperable tool
- Wrapped packages gain framework benefits, such as workflow inter operability
- ToolShed repository automates tool wrapper installation for server administrators.
- Many "Flavours" are available for a framework instance.
- Adaptable to any kind of open science data where packages are available to wrap.

???


- Galaxy was created to make open science analyses, reproducible and transparent.
- Solve those tough challenges once, in a generic scientific workflow application.
- Build those core scientific requirements into every analysis and output.
- Accommodate any command line analysis package as an inter operable tool, to suit any scientist.
- Make it easy to wrap packages, and install as tools, into that generic framework.
- Domain specific tools, such as public health, or muon science, give each instance a specific flavour for local users.
- The analysis needs of any field, can be satisfied, by installing a matching set of tools.

## Free analysis services drive software quality improvement and scientific value

- Galaxy source code has been running on real hardware since the initial 2005 publication.
- Providing free, reliable analysis services and storage for anyone, anywhere.
- Increasingly heavy use provides realistic, non-stop software stress testing
- Users contribute insight and experience to improve functionality
- Independent developers contribute improvements and help fix bugs
- Reliable software engineering practices are encouraged by heavy use at scale

???

- An innovative analysis service, running Galaxy code, has been available since two thousand and five.
- It quickly attracted users, collaborators, and research grant support.
- Running a free, and highly used service, provides thorough testing, for the code.
- Tens of thousands of scientists generate bug reports,feedback and ideas for improvement
- Participants contribute bug fixes, ideas and code improvements.
- This helps us maintain robust code, that provides increasing value to users, over time.

## Organic, collaborative growth driven by increasing value to scientists

- Reliable, free analysis services rapidly attracted users and contributors.
- New interacting grants have joined and extended the project, such as the GTN
- Growth is organic and self-regulating.
- Open shared values make it easier for large scale collaborations to function efficiently.
- Scientists benefit from easy access to reliable complex analyses and training
- Hundreds of community participants also regularly contribute their skills and ideas.



???

- Galaxy continues to grow rapidly, because scientists value it highly
- Encouraging new collaborations, brings new capabilities, and new user communities
- Organic, self governed growth, produces increasing complexity and diversity
- Shared open source community values help maintain, engagement, coherence, and stability
- Scientists gain free access to resources that they value highly in their work.
- Contributor engagement is vital to growth and sustainability in Open projects

## Today

- Galaxy is a global, self governed, multi-investigator collaboration.
- Framework source code is the core deliverable to support open science analysis
- Free analysis services and training resources use project source code, for anyone, anywhere.
- Tens of thousands of scientists rely on it for analyses each day
- 8000+ interoperable open source analysis packages as tools in the toolshed
- Adopted by data rich communities, such as climate science, public health and proteomics.
- Other lessons in this Topic provide stories and a field guide.

???

- Today, Galaxy is a self-governing collaborative community, with a shared mission
- Supporting open science, with code to make reproducible, and transparent analyses, easy.
- Free services using that code, add value, for researchers.
- Supporting analyses, for tens of thousands of scientists, every day.
- Thousands of ready to run tools are available from the Tool Shed.
- Tool kits for different fields can be created, from existing command line analysis packages.
- Describing how all the pieces fit together, is a challenge, addressed by other parts of this material

## How Galaxy differs from most open source projects

- Open source projects maintain public code repositories and provide support to end users.
- Galaxy does that, but also runs project code 24x7, at scale, providing high availability services.
- That would be impossible without resources and effort from a global, open collaboration.
    - Contributors, investigators and grants come from many different institutions.
    - No single institution controls Galaxy, so participants govern it for themselves.
    - Only a global community enterprise could provide these services, at no cost to users.
- Skilled participant contributions help the project grow, improve and remain sustainable.
- Open projects succeed by encouraging and facilitating community engagement.
- Helping participants find their way to join in this rapidly growing project is a work in progress.


???

- An open source repository on Github can be maintained without direct costs.
- In contrast, Galaxy's free analysis services consume substantial and expensive computational infrastructure.
- They require highly skilled and dedicated personnel, for their reliable operation.
- Provided by collaborating grants, supported by a community, with open, participatory governance.
- Community engagement and collaborations are highly valued and encouraged.
- Participation drives improvement, expansion and long term sustainability.
