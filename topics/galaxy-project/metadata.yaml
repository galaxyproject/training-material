summary: "Depending on how you engage, Galaxy can be many different things. 

At it's heart is an open source project, but since starting in 2005, the code has been run on substantial hardware, to provide accessible, reliable and transparent data analysis and training, for researchers in data-rich fields. 

Services are provided 24x7, at a global scale, at no cost to users, and are supported by a large and active community. 

These open science services are a distinguishing feature, compared to most other open source projects. Comparable, multi-disciplinary, free analysis services at this kind of scale for researchers, are not common. Few are as heavily used. Commercial services running proprietary analysis platform code are extremely costly, and indeed, the Galaxy collaborators provide very substantial grant and infrastructure resources to provide 'free' services.

How is this is possible? What makes Galaxy so valuable to scientists? Are there lessons to be learned in the story of the origins, growth and success?

These are some of the issues addressed in this training topic.
*Work in progress November 2022*. 
Please help make it better for the community."
