title: "Galaxy project guide"
summary: "Depending on how you engage, Galaxy can be many different things. 

Galaxy is an unusual open source project because since 2005, the project code has been continuously deployed, on increasingly substantial hardware, to provide accessible, reliable and transparent open science data analysis and training at no cost to researchers. 

These highly valued and reliable services operate 24x7, supported by multiple collaborating grants and a community of contributors. 

Open science services are a distinguishing feature of Galaxy, compared to most other self-governing open source projects. Comparable, multi-disciplinary, free analysis services at this scale for researchers, are rare and few are as heavily used. Comparable commercial services are extremely costly.

How is it possible for Galaxy to sustain high quality, free services? What makes Galaxy so valuable to scientists? Are there lessons to be learned in the story of the origins, growth and success?

These are some of the issues addressed in this training topic.
Extremely Work in progress November 2022."
