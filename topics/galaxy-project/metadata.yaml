title: "Galaxy project guide"
summary: "Depending on how you engage, Galaxy can be many different things. 

Galaxy is open source, but unusually, since 2005, the project code has been running on increasingly substantial hardware, to provide accessible, reliable and transparent open science data analysis and training. 

Services are provided 24x7, at no cost to users, supported by a large and active community. 

Open science services are a distinguishing feature, compared to most other self-governing open source projects. Comparable, multi-disciplinary, free analysis services at this scale for researchers, are not common. Few are as heavily used. Comparable commercial services are extremely costly.

How is it possible for Galaxy to sustain high quality, free services? What makes Galaxy so valuable to scientists? Are there lessons to be learned in the story of the origins, growth and success?

These are some of the issues addressed in this training topic.
Extremely Work in progress November 2022."
