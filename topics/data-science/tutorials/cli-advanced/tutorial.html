<h1 id="pipes-and-filtering">Pipes and Filtering</h1>

<p>Now that we know a few basic commands,
we can finally look at the shell’s most powerful feature:
the ease with which it lets us combine existing programs in new ways.
We’ll start with the directory called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shell-lesson-data/molecules</code>
that contains six files describing some simple organic molecules.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pdb</code> extension indicates that these files are in Protein Data Bank format,
a simple text format that specifies the type and position of each atom in the molecule.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/
<span class="nb">ls </span>molecules
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s go into that directory with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> and run an example command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc cubane.pdb</code>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd </span>molecules
<span class="nb">wc </span>cubane
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc</code> is the ‘word count’ command:
it counts the number of lines, words, and characters in files (from left to right, in that order).</p>

<p>If we run the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc *.pdb</code>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.pdb</code> matches zero or more characters,
so the shell turns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.pdb</code> into a list of all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pdb</code> files in the current directory:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">wc</span> <span class="k">*</span>.pdb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc *.pdb</code> also shows the total number of all lines in the last line of the output.</p>

<p>If we run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc -l</code> instead of just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc</code>,
the output shows only the number of lines per file:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">wc</span> <span class="nt">-l</span> <span class="k">*</span>.pdb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-m</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-w</code> options can also be used with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc</code> command, to show

  <p>What happens if a command is supposed to process a file, but we
don’t give it a filename? For example, what if we type:</p>

  <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">wc</span> <span class="nt">-l</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>but don’t type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.pdb</code> (or anything else) after the command?
Since it doesn’t have any filenames, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc</code> assumes it is supposed to
process input given at the command prompt, so it just sits there and waits for us to give
it some data interactively. From the outside, though, all we see is it
sitting there: the command doesn’t appear to do anything.</p>

  <p>If you make this kind of mistake, you can escape out of this state by holding down
the control key (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>) and typing the letter <kbd>C</kbd> once and
letting go of the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key.

<h2 id="capturing-output-from-commands">Capturing output from commands</h2>

<p>Which of these files contains the fewest lines?
It’s an easy question to answer when there are only six files,
but what if there were 6000?
Our first step toward a solution is to run the command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">wc</span> <span class="nt">-l</span> <span class="k">*</span>.pdb <span class="o">&gt;</span> lengths.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The greater than symbol, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code>, tells the shell to <strong>redirect</strong> the command’s output
to a file instead of printing it to the screen. (This is why there is no screen output:
everything that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc</code> would have printed has gone into the
file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lengths.txt</code> instead.)  The shell will create
the file if it doesn’t exist. If the file exists, it will be
silently overwritten, which may lead to data loss and thus requires
some caution.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <div class="box-title tip-title" id="tip-no-code-gt-code-on-an-azerty-keyboard"><button class="gtn-boxify-button tip" type="button" aria-controls="tip-no-code-gt-code-on-an-azerty-keyboard" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Tip: No <code>&gt;</code> on an AZERTY keyboard?</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>
  <p>You can rewrite this using the tee command which writes out a file, while also showing the output to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stdout</code>.</p>
  <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">wc</span> <span class="nt">-l</span> <span class="k">*</span>.pdb | <span class="nb">tee </span>lengths.txt
</code></pre></div>  </div>
  <p>Or you can use copy and paste to copy the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code> character from the materials.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls lengths.txt</code> confirms that the file exists:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls </span>lengths.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can now send the content of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lengths.txt</code> to the screen using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat lengths.txt</code>.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat</code> command gets its name from ‘concatenate’ i.e. join together,
and it prints the contents of files one after another.
There’s only one file in this case,
so <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat</code> just shows us what it contains:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cat </span>lengths.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <div class="box-title tip-title" id="tip-output-page-by-page-1"><button class="gtn-boxify-button tip" type="button" aria-controls="tip-output-page-by-page-1" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Tip: Output Page by Page</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p>We’ll continue to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat</code> in this lesson, for convenience and consistency,
but it has the disadvantage that it always dumps the whole file onto your screen.
More useful in practice is the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">less</code>,
which you use with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">less lengths.txt</code>.
This displays a screenful of the file, and then stops.
You can go forward one screenful by pressing the spacebar,
or back one by pressing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">b</code>.  Press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">q</code> to quit.</p>

<h2 id="filtering-output">Filtering output</h2>

<p>Next we’ll use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sort</code> command to sort the contents of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lengths.txt</code> file.
But first we’ll use an exercise to learn a little about the sort command:</p>

<blockquote class="question">
  <div class="box-title question-title" id="question-what-does-sort-n-do"><i class="far fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Question: What Does `sort -n` Do?</div>

  <p>The file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shell-lesson-data/numbers.txt</code>
contains the following lines:</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>10
2
19
22
6
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>If we run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sort</code> on this file, the output is:</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>10
19
2
22

  <p>If we run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sort -n</code> on the same file, we get this instead:</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2
6
10
19

  <p>Explain why <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-n</code> has this effect.</p>

    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-n</code> option specifies a numerical rather than an alphanumerical sort.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>We will also use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-n</code> option to specify that the sort is
numerical instead of alphanumerical.
This does <em>not</em> change the file;
instead, it sends the sorted result to the screen:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sort</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> lengths.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can put the sorted list of lines in another temporary file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sorted-lengths.txt</code>
by putting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt; sorted-lengths.txt</code> after the command,
just as we used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt; lengths.txt</code> to put the output of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc</code> into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lengths.txt</code>.
Once we’ve done that,
we can run another command called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code> to get the first few lines in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sorted-lengths.txt</code>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sort</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> lengths.txt <span class="o">&gt;</span> sorted-lengths.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-n 1</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code> tells it that
we only want the first line of the file;
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-n 20</code> would get the first 20,
and so on.
Since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sorted-lengths.txt</code> contains the lengths of our files ordered from least to greatest,
the output of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code> must be the file with the fewest lines.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <div class="box-title tip-title" id="tip-redirecting-to-the-same-file-1"><button class="gtn-boxify-button tip" type="button" aria-controls="tip-redirecting-to-the-same-file-1" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Tip: Redirecting to the same file</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p>It’s a very bad idea to try redirecting

to the same file. For example:</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sort -n lengths.txt &gt; lengths.txt

  <p>Doing something like this may give you
incorrect results and/or delete
the contents of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lengths.txt</code>.</p>

  <p>We have seen the use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code>, but there is a similar operator <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;&gt;</code>
which works slightly differently.
We’ll learn about the differences between these two operators by printing some strings.
We can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo</code> command to print strings e.g.</p>

  <blockquote class="code-in">
    <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-bash-3"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Bash</div>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The echo command prints text
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Now test the commands below to reveal the difference between the two operators:</p>

  <blockquote class="code-in">
    <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-bash-4"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Bash</div>
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ echo hello &gt; testfile01.txt

  <p>and:</p>

  <blockquote class="code-in">

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ echo hello &gt;&gt; testfile02.txt
</code></pre></div>    </div>

  <p><strong>Hint</strong>: Try executing each command twice in a row and then examining the output files.</p>

  <blockquote class="solution">
    <h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
    <p>In the first example with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code>, the string ‘hello’ is written to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">testfile01.txt</code>,
but the file gets overwritten each time we run the command.</p>

    <p>We see from the second example that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;&gt;</code> operator also writes ‘hello’ to a file
(in this case<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">testfile02.txt</code>),
but appends the string to the file if it already exists
(i.e. when we run it for the second time).</p>

<h2 id="passing-output-to-another-command">Passing output to another command</h2>
<p>In our example of finding the file with the fewest lines,
we are using two intermediate files <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lengths.txt</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sorted-lengths.txt</code> to store output.
This is a confusing way to work because
even once you understand what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sort</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code> do,
those intermediate files make it hard to follow what’s going on.
We can make it easier to understand by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sort</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code> together:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sort</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> lengths.txt | <span class="nb">head</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The vertical bar, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code>, between the two commands is called a <strong>pipe</strong>.
It tells the shell that we want to use
the output of the command on the left
as the input to the command on the right.</p>

<p>This has removed the need for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sorted-lengths.txt</code> file.</p>

<h2 id="combining-multiple-commands">Combining multiple commands</h2>
<p>Nothing prevents us from chaining pipes consecutively.
We can for example send the output of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc</code> directly to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sort</code>,
and then the resulting output to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code>.
This removes the need for any intermediate files.</p>

<p>We’ll start by using a pipe to send the output of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sort</code>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">wc</span> <span class="nt">-l</span> <span class="k">*</span>.pdb | <span class="nb">sort</span> <span class="nt">-n</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can then send that output through another pipe, to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code>, so that the full pipeline becomes:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">wc</span> <span class="nt">-l</span> <span class="k">*</span>.pdb | <span class="nb">sort</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> | <span class="nb">head</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is exactly like a mathematician nesting functions like <em>log(3x)</em>
and saying ‘the log of three times <em>x</em>’.
In our case,
the calculation is ‘head of sort of line count of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.pdb</code>’.</p>

<p>The redirection and pipes used in the last few commands are illustrated below:</p>

<p><a href="../../images/carpentries-cli/redirects-and-pipes.svg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/carpentries-cli/redirects-and-pipes.svg" alt="Redirects and Pipes of different commands. " width="800" height="560" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc -l *.pdb</code> will direct the output to the shell. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc -l *.pdb &gt; lengths</code> will
direct output to the file lengths. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc -l *.pdb | sort -n | head -n 1</code> will
build a pipeline where the output of the wc command is the input to the sort
command, the output of the sort command is the input to the head command and
the output of the head command is directed to the shell</p>

<h2 id="tools-designed-to-work-together">Tools designed to work together</h2>
<p>This idea of linking programs together is why Unix has been so successful.
Instead of creating enormous programs that try to do many different things,
Unix programmers focus on creating lots of simple tools that each do one job well,
and that work well with each other.
This programming model is called ‘pipes and filters’.
We’ve already seen pipes;
a <strong>filter</strong> is a program like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sort</code>
that transforms a stream of input into a stream of output.
Almost all of the standard Unix tools can work this way:
unless told to do otherwise,
they read from standard input,
do something with what they’ve read,
and write to standard output.</p>

<p>The key is that any program that reads lines of text from standard input
and writes lines of text to standard output
can be combined with every other program that behaves this way as well.
You can <em>and should</em> write your programs this way
so that you and other people can put those programs into pipes to multiply their power.</p>

<h2 id="nelles-pipeline-checking-files">Nelle’s Pipeline: Checking Files</h2>

<p>Nelle has run her samples through the assay machines
and created 17 files in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03</code> directory described earlier.
As a quick check, starting from her home directory, Nelle types:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03
<span class="nb">wc</span> <span class="nt">-l</span> <span class="k">*</span>.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The output is 18 lines that look like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>300 NENE01729A.txt
300 NENE01729B.txt
300 NENE01736A.txt
300 NENE01751A.txt
300 NENE01751B.txt
300 NENE01812A.txt
... ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now she types this:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">wc</span> <span class="nt">-l</span> <span class="k">*</span>.txt | <span class="nb">sort</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> | <span class="nb">head</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> 5
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Whoops: one of the files is 60 lines shorter than the others.
When she goes back and checks it,
she sees that she did that assay at 8:00 on a Monday morning — someone
was probably in using the machine on the weekend,
and she forgot to reset it.
Before re-running that sample,
she checks to see if any files have too much data:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">wc</span> <span class="nt">-l</span> <span class="k">*</span>.txt | <span class="nb">sort</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> | <span class="nb">tail</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> 5
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Those numbers look good — but what’s that ‘Z’ doing there in the third-to-last line?
All of her samples should be marked ‘A’ or ‘B’;
by convention,
her lab uses ‘Z’ to indicate samples with missing information.
To find others like it, she does this:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls</span> <span class="k">*</span>Z.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sure enough,
when she checks the log on her laptop,
there’s no depth recorded for either of those samples.
Since it’s too late to get the information any other way,
she must exclude those two files from her analysis.
She could delete them using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm</code>,
but there are actually some analyses she might do later where depth doesn’t matter,
so instead, she’ll have to be careful later on to select files using the wildcard expressions
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt</code>.</p>

<h1 id="loops">Loops</h1>

<p><strong>Loops</strong> are a programming construct which allow us to repeat a command or set of commands
for each item in a list.
As such they are key to productivity improvements through automation.
Similar to wildcards and tab completion, using loops also reduces the
amount of typing required (and hence reduces the number of typing mistakes).</p>

<p>Suppose we have several hundred genome data files named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basilisk.dat</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minotaur.dat</code>, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unicorn.dat</code>.
For this example, we’ll use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">creatures</code> directory which only has three example files,
but the principles can be applied to many many more files at once. First, go
into the creatures directory.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Change directories here!</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The structure of these files is the same: the common name, classification, and updated date are
presented on the first three lines, with DNA sequences on the following lines.
Let’s look at the files:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">head</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> 5 basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We would like to print out the classification for each species, which is given on the second
line of each file.
For each file, we would need to execute the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head -n 2</code> and pipe this to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tail -n 1</code>.
We’ll use a loop to solve this problem, but first let’s look at the general form of a loop:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>for thing in list_of_things
do
    operation_using $thing    # Indentation within the loop is not required, but aids legibility
done
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and we can apply this to our example like this:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">for </span>filename <span class="k">in </span>basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat
<span class="k">do
    </span><span class="nb">head</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> 2 <span class="nv">$filename</span> | <span class="nb">tail</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> 1
<span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <div class="box-title tip-title" id="tip-follow-the-prompt-1"><button class="gtn-boxify-button tip" type="button" aria-controls="tip-follow-the-prompt-1" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Tip: Follow the Prompt</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p>The shell prompt changes from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code> and back again as we were
typing in our loop. The second prompt, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code>, is different to remind
us that we haven’t finished typing a complete command yet. A semicolon, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">;</code>,
can be used to separate two commands written on a single line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the shell sees the keyword <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code>,
it knows to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each item in a list.
Each time the loop runs (called an iteration), an item in the list is assigned in sequence to
the <strong>variable</strong>, and the commands inside the loop are executed, before moving on to
the next item in the list.
Inside the loop,
we call for the variable’s value by putting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> in front of it.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> tells the shell interpreter to treat
the variable as a variable name and substitute its value in its place,
rather than treat it as text or an external command.</p>

<p>In this example, the list is three filenames: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basilisk.dat</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minotaur.dat</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unicorn.dat</code>.
Each time the loop iterates, it will assign a file name to the variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filename</code>
and run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code> command.
The first time through the loop,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$filename</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basilisk.dat</code>.
The interpreter runs the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code> on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basilisk.dat</code>
and pipes the first two lines to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tail</code> command,
which then prints the second line of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basilisk.dat</code>.
For the second iteration, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$filename</code> becomes
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minotaur.dat</code>. This time, the shell runs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code> on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minotaur.dat</code>
and pipes the first two lines to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tail</code> command,
which then prints the second line of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minotaur.dat</code>.
For the third iteration, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$filename</code> becomes
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unicorn.dat</code>, so the shell runs the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code> command on that file,
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tail</code> on the output of that.
Since the list was only three items, the shell exits the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> loop.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <div class="box-title tip-title" id="tip-same-symbols-different-meanings-1"><button class="gtn-boxify-button tip" type="button" aria-controls="tip-same-symbols-different-meanings-1" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Tip: Same Symbols, Different Meanings</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p>Here we see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code> being used as a shell prompt, whereas <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code> is also
used to redirect output.
Similarly, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> is used as a shell prompt, but, as we saw earlier,
it is also used to ask the shell to get the value of a variable.</p>

  <p>If the <em>shell</em> prints <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> then it expects you to type something,
and the symbol is a prompt.</p>

  <p>If <em>you</em> type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> yourself, it is an instruction from you that
the shell should redirect output or get the value of a variable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When using variables it is also
possible to put the names into curly braces to clearly delimit the variable
name: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$filename</code> is equivalent to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">${filename}</code>, but is different from
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">${file}name</code>. You may find this notation in other people’s programs.</p>

<p>We have called the variable in this loop <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filename</code>
in order to make its purpose clearer to human readers.
The shell itself doesn’t care what the variable is called;
if we wrote this loop as:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">for </span>x <span class="k">in </span>basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat
<span class="k">do
    </span><span class="nb">head</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> 2 <span class="nv">$x</span> | <span class="nb">tail</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> 1
<span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">for </span>temperature <span class="k">in </span>basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat
<span class="k">do
    </span><span class="nb">head</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> 2 <span class="nv">$temperature</span> | <span class="nb">tail</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> 1
<span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>it would work exactly the same way.</p>

<h1 id="dont-do-this">Don’t do this.</h1>

<p>Programs are only useful if people can understand them,
so meaningless names (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>) or misleading names (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">temperature</code>)
increase the odds that the program won’t do what its readers think it does.</p>

    <p>The first code block gives the same output on each iteration through
the loop.
Bash expands the wildcard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.pdb</code> within the loop body (as well as
before the loop starts) to match all files ending in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pdb</code>
and then lists them using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>.
The expanded loop would look like this:</p>

</blockquote>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Explore the possible solutions here!</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s continue with our example in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shell-lesson-data/creatures</code> directory.
Here’s a slightly more complicated loop:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">for </span>filename <span class="k">in</span> <span class="k">*</span>.dat
<span class="k">do
    </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$filename</span>
    <span class="nb">head</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> 100 <span class="nv">$filename</span> | <span class="nb">tail</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> 20
<span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The shell starts by expanding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.dat</code> to create the list of files it will process.
The <strong>loop body</strong>
then executes two commands for each of those files.
The first command, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo</code>, prints its command-line arguments to standard output.
For example:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">echo </span>hello there
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>prints:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>hello there
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case,
since the shell expands <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$filename</code> to be the name of a file,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo $filename</code> prints the name of the file.
Note that we can’t write this as:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">for </span>filename <span class="k">in</span> <span class="k">*</span>.dat
<span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="nv">$filename</span>
    <span class="nb">head</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> 100 <span class="nv">$filename</span> | <span class="nb">tail</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> 20
<span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>because then the first time through the loop,
when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$filename</code> expanded to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basilisk.dat</code>, the shell would try to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basilisk.dat</code> as a program.
Finally,
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tail</code> combination selects lines 81-100
from whatever file is being processed
(assuming the file has at least 100 lines).</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <div class="box-title tip-title" id="tip-spaces-in-names-1"><button class="gtn-boxify-button tip" type="button" aria-controls="tip-spaces-in-names-1" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Tip: Spaces in Names</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p>Spaces are used to separate the elements of the list
that we are going to loop over. If one of those elements
contains a space character, we need to surround it with
quotes, and do the same thing to our loop variable.
Suppose our data files are named:</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>red dragon.dat
purple unicorn.dat
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>To loop over these files, we would need to add double quotes like so:</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ for filename in "red dragon.dat" "purple unicorn.dat"
&gt; do
&gt;     head -n 100 "$filename" | tail -n 20
&gt; done
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>It is simpler to avoid using spaces (or other special characters) in filenames.</p>

  <p>The files above don’t exist, so if we run the above code, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code> command will be unable
to find them, however the error message returned will show the name of the files it is
expecting:</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>head: cannot open ‘red dragon.dat’ for reading: No such file or directory
head: cannot open ‘purple unicorn.dat’ for reading: No such file or directory
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>Try removing the quotes around <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$filename</code> in the loop above to see the effect of the quote
marks on spaces. Note that we get a result from the loop command for unicorn.dat
when we run this code in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">creatures</code> directory:</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>head: cannot open ‘red’ for reading: No such file or directory
head: cannot open ‘dragon.dat’ for reading: No such file or directory
head: cannot open ‘purple’ for reading: No such file or directory
CGGTACCGAA
AAGGGTCGCG
CAAGTGTTCC
...
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>We would like to modify each of the files in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shell-lesson-data/creatures</code>, but also save a version
of the original files, naming the copies <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">original-basilisk.dat</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">original-unicorn.dat</code>.
We can’t use:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cp *.dat original-*.dat
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>because that would expand to:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cp </span>basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat original-<span class="k">*</span>.dat
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This wouldn’t back up our files, instead we get an error.</p>

<p>This problem arises when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp</code> receives more than two inputs. When this happens, it
expects the last input to be a directory where it can copy all the files it was passed.
Since there is no directory named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">original-*.dat</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">creatures</code> directory we get an
error.</p>

<p>Instead, we can use a loop:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">for </span>filename <span class="k">in</span> <span class="k">*</span>.dat
<span class="k">do
    </span><span class="nb">cp</span> <span class="nv">$filename</span> original-<span class="nv">$filename</span>
<span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This loop runs the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp</code> command once for each filename.
The first time,
when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$filename</code> expands to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basilisk.dat</code>,
the shell executes:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cp basilisk.dat original-basilisk.dat
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The second time, the command is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cp minotaur.dat original-minotaur.dat
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The third and last time, the command is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cp unicorn.dat original-unicorn.dat
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp</code> command does not normally produce any output, it’s hard to check
that the loop is doing the correct thing.
However, we learned earlier how to print strings using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo</code>, and we can modify the loop
to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo</code> to print our commands without actually executing them.
As such we can check what commands <em>would be</em> run in the unmodified loop.</p>

<p>The following diagram
shows what happens when the modified loop is executed, and demonstrates how the
judicious use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo</code> is a good debugging technique.</p>

<p><a href="../../images/carpentries-cli/shell_script_for_loop_flow_chart.svg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/carpentries-cli/shell_script_for_loop_flow_chart.svg" alt="The for loop 'for filename in *.dat; do echo cp $filename original-$filename; done' will successively assign the names of all '*.dat' files in your current directory to the variable '$filename' and then execute the command.

<h2 id="nelles-pipeline-processing-files">Nelle’s Pipeline: Processing Files</h2>

<p>Nelle is now ready to process her data files using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">goostats.sh</code> —
a shell script written by her supervisor.
This calculates some statistics from a protein sample file, and takes two arguments:</p>

<ol>
  <li>an input file (containing the raw data)</li>
  <li>an output file (to store the calculated statistics)</li>
</ol>

<p>Since she’s still learning how to use the shell,
she decides to build up the required commands in stages.
Her first step is to make sure that she can select the right input files — remember,
these are ones whose names end in ‘A’ or ‘B’, rather than ‘Z’.
Starting from her home directory, Nelle types:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03
<span class="k">for </span>datafile <span class="k">in </span>NENE<span class="k">*</span>A.txt NENE<span class="k">*</span>B.txt
<span class="k">do
    </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$datafile</span>
<span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Her next step is to decide
what to call the files that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">goostats.sh</code> analysis program will create.
Prefixing each input file’s name with ‘stats’ seems simple,
so she modifies her loop to do that:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">for </span>datafile <span class="k">in </span>NENE<span class="k">*</span>A.txt NENE<span class="k">*</span>B.txt
<span class="k">do
    </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$datafile</span> stats-<span class="nv">$datafile</span>
<span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>She hasn’t actually run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">goostats.sh</code> yet,
but now she’s sure she can select the right files and generate the right output filenames.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <div class="box-title tip-title" id="tip-top-terminal-tip-re-running-previous-commands-1"><button class="gtn-boxify-button tip" type="button" aria-controls="tip-top-terminal-tip-re-running-previous-commands-1" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Tip: Top Terminal Tip: Re-running previous commands</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>
  <p>Typing in commands over and over again is becoming tedious,
though,
and Nelle is worried about making mistakes,
so instead of re-entering her loop,
she presses <kbd>↑</kbd>.
In response,
the shell redisplays the whole loop on one line
(using semi-colons to separate the pieces):</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do echo $datafile stats-$datafile; done
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>Using the left arrow key,
Nelle backs up and changes the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash goostats.sh</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile; done
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When she presses <kbd>Enter</kbd>,
the shell runs the modified command.
However, nothing appears to happen — there is no output.
After a moment, Nelle realizes that since her script doesn’t print anything to the screen
any longer, she has no idea whether it is running, much less how quickly.
She kills the running command by typing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>,
uses <kbd>↑</kbd> to repeat the command,
and edits it to read:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do echo $datafile; bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile; done
</code></pre></div></div>

  <p>We can move to the beginning of a line in the shell by typing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>
and to the end using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When she runs her program now,
it produces one line of output every five seconds or so:</p>

<p>1518 times 5 seconds,
divided by 60,
tells her that her script will take about two hours to run.
As a final check,
she opens another terminal window,
goes into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03</code>,
and uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat stats-NENE01729B.txt</code>
to examine one of the output files.
It looks good,
so she decides to get some coffee and catch up on her reading.</p>

  <p>Another way to repeat previous work is to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">history</code> command to
get a list of the last few hundred commands that have been executed, and
then to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!123</code> (where ‘123’ is replaced by the command number) to
repeat one of those commands. For example, if Nelle types this:</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ history | tail -n 5
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  456  ls -l NENE0*.txt
  457  rm stats-NENE01729B.txt.txt

  459  ls -l NENE0*.txt
  460  history
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>then she can re-run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">goostats.sh</code> on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NENE01729B.txt</code> simply by typing
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!458</code>. This number will be different for you, you should check your history before running it!</p>

  <p>There are a number of other shortcut commands for getting at the history.</p>

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> one or more additional times to search for earlier matches.
You can then use the left and right arrow keys to choose that line and edit
it then hit <kbd>Return</kbd> to run the command.</li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!!</code> retrieves the immediately preceding command
(you may or may not find this more convenient than using <kbd>↑</kbd>)</li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!$</code> retrieves the last word of the last command.
That’s useful more often than you might expect: after
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash goostats.sh NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt</code>, you can type
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">less !$</code> to look at the file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stats-NENE01729B.txt</code>, which is

  <p>A loop is a way to do many things at once — or to make many mistakes at

<h1 id="finding-things">Finding Things</h1>

<p>In the same way that many of us now use ‘Google’ as a
verb meaning ‘to find’, Unix programmers often use the
word ‘grep’.
‘grep’ is a contraction of ‘global/regular expression/print’,
a common sequence of operations in early Unix text editors.
It is also the name of a very useful command-line program.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code> finds and prints lines in files that match a pattern.
For our examples,
we will use a file that contains three haiku taken from a
1998 competition in <em>Salon</em> magazine. For this set of examples,
we’re going to be working in the writing subdirectory:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd
cd </span>Desktop/shell-lesson-data/writing
<span class="nb">cat </span>haiku.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

  <p>We haven’t linked to the original haiku because
they don’t appear to be on <em>Salon</em>’s site any longer.
As <a href="https://www.clir.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/ensuring.pdf">Jeff Rothenberg said</a>,
‘Digital information lasts forever — or five years, whichever comes first.’
Luckily, popular content often <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?ComputerErrorHaiku">has backups</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s find lines that contain the word ‘not’:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">grep </span>not haiku.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">not</code> is the pattern we’re searching for.
The grep command searches through the file, looking for matches to the pattern specified.
To use it type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code>, then the pattern we’re searching for and finally
the name of the file (or files) we’re searching in.</p>

<p>The output is the three lines in the file that contain the letters ‘not’.</p>

<p>By default, grep searches for a pattern in a case-sensitive way.
In addition, the search pattern we have selected does not have to form a complete word,
as we will see in the next example.</p>

<p>Let’s search for the pattern: ‘The’.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">grep </span>The haiku.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This time, two lines that include the letters ‘The’ are outputted,
one of which contained our search pattern within a larger word, ‘Thesis’.</p>

<p>To restrict matches to lines containing the word ‘The’ on its own,
we can give <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code> with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-w</code> option.
This will limit matches to word boundaries.</p>

<p>Later in this lesson, we will also see how we can change the search behavior of grep
with respect to its case sensitivity.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="nt">-w</span> The haiku.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that a ‘word boundary’ includes the start and end of a line, so not
just letters surrounded by spaces.
Sometimes we don’t
want to search for a single word, but a phrase. This is also easy to do with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code> by putting the phrase in quotes.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="nt">-w</span> <span class="s2">"is not"</span> haiku.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ve now seen that you don’t have to have quotes around single words,
but it is useful to use quotes when searching for multiple words.
It also helps to make it easier to distinguish between the search term or phrase
and the file being searched.
We will use quotes in the remaining examples.</p>

<p>Another useful option is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-n</code>, which numbers the lines that match:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> <span class="s2">"it"</span> haiku.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, we can see that lines 5, 9, and 10 contain the letters ‘it’.</p>

<p>We can combine options (i.e. flags) as we do with other Unix commands.
For example, let’s find the lines that contain the word ‘the’.
We can combine the option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-w</code> to find the lines that contain the word ‘the’
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-n</code> to number the lines that match:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> <span class="nt">-w</span> <span class="s2">"the"</span> haiku.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we want to use the option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-i</code> to make our search case-insensitive:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> <span class="nt">-w</span> <span class="nt">-i</span> <span class="s2">"the"</span> haiku.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we want to use the option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-v</code> to invert our search, i.e., we want to output
the lines that do not contain the word ‘the’.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="nt">-n</span> <span class="nt">-w</span> <span class="nt">-v</span> <span class="s2">"the"</span> haiku.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-r</code> (recursive) option,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code> can search for a pattern recursively through a set of files in subdirectories.</p>

<p>Let’s search recursively for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Yesterday</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shell-lesson-data/writing</code> directory:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="nt">-r</span> Yesterday <span class="nb">.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code> has lots of other options. To find out what they are, we can type:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="nt">--help</span>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code>’s real power doesn’t come from its options, though; it comes from
the fact that patterns can include wildcards. (The technical name for
these is <strong>regular expressions</strong>, which
is what the ‘re’ in ‘grep’ stands for.) Regular expressions are both complex
and powerful; if you want to do complex searches, please look at the lesson
on <a href="http://v4.software-carpentry.org/regexp/index.html">our website</a>. As a taster, we can
find lines that have an ‘o’ in the second position like this:</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ grep -E "^.o" haiku.txt

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>You bring fresh toner.

  <p>We use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-E</code> option and put the pattern in quotes to prevent the shell
from trying to interpret it. (If the pattern contained a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code>, for
example, the shell would try to expand it before running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code>.) The
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">^</code> in the pattern anchors the match to the start of the line. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code>
matches a single character (just like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code> in the shell), while the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o</code>
matches an actual ‘o’.</p>

  <p>Leah has several hundred

2013-11-06,deer,2

  <p>She wants to write a shell script that takes a species as the first command-line argument
and a directory as the second argument. The script should return one file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">species.txt</code>
containing a list of dates and the number of that species seen on each date.
For example using the data shown above, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rabbit.txt</code> would contain:</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2013-11-05,22

  <p>Put these commands and pipes in the right order to achieve this:</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cut -d : -f 2

grep -w $1 -r $2
|
$1.txt
cut -d , -f 1,3

  <p>Hint: use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man grep</code> to look for how to grep text recursively in a directory
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man cut</code> to select more than one field in a line.</p>

  <p>An example of such a file is provided in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shell-lesson-data/data/animal-counts/animals.txt</code></p>

  <p>You and your friend, having just finished reading <em>Little Women</em> by
Louisa May Alcott, are in an argument.  Of the four sisters in the
book, Jo, Meg, Beth, and Amy, your friend thinks that Jo was the
most mentioned.  You, however, are certain it was Amy.  Luckily, you
have a file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LittleWomen.txt</code> containing the full text of the novel
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shell-lesson-data/writing/data/LittleWomen.txt</code>).
Using a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> loop, how would you tabulate the number of times each
of the four sisters is mentioned?</p>

  <p>Hint: one solution might employ
the commands <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc</code> and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code>, while another might utilize
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code> options.
There is often more than one way to solve a programming task, so a

    <p>This solution is inferior because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep -c</code> only reports the number of lines matched.
The total number of matches reported by this method will be lower if there is more
than one match per line.</p>

    <p>Perceptive observers may have noticed that character names sometimes appear in all-uppercase
in chapter titles (e.g. ‘MEG GOES TO VANITY FAIR’).
If you wanted to count these as well, you could add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-i</code> option for case-insensitivity
(though in this case, it doesn’t affect the answer to which sister is mentioned
most frequently).</p>

<p>While <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code> finds lines in files,
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find</code> command finds files themselves.
Again,
it has a lot of options;
to show how the simplest ones work, we’ll use the directory tree shown below.</p>

<p><a href="../../images/carpentries-cli/find-file-tree.svg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/carpentries-cli/find-file-tree.svg" alt="A file tree under the directory 'writing' contians several sub-directories and files such that 'writing' contains directories 'data', 'thesis', 'tools' and a file 'haiku.txt'; 'writing/data' contains the files 'Little Women.txt', 'one.txt' and 'two.txt'; 'writing/thesis' contains the file 'empty-draft.md'; 'writing/tools' contains the directory 'old' and the files 'format' and 'stats'; and 'writing/tools/old' contains a file 'oldtool'. " width="172" height="139" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

<p>Nelle’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">writing</code> directory contains one file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">haiku.txt</code> and three subdirectories:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thesis</code> (which contains a sadly empty file, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">empty-draft.md</code>);
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code> (which contains three files <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LittleWomen.txt</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">one.txt</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">two.txt</code>);
and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tools</code> directory that contains the programs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">format</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stats</code>,
and a subdirectory called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">old</code>, with a file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oldtool</code>.</p>

<p>For our first command,
let’s run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find .</code> (remember to run this command from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shell-lesson-data/writing</code> folder).</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>find <span class="nb">.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As always,
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code> on its own means the current working directory,
which is where we want our search to start.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find</code>’s output is the names of every file <strong>and</strong> directory
under the current working directory.
This can seem useless at first but <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find</code> has many options
to filter the output and in this lesson we will discover some
of them.</p>

<p>The first option in our list is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-type d</code> that means ‘things that are directories’.
Sure enough,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find</code>’s output is the names of the five directories in our little tree
(including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code>):</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>find <span class="nb">.</span> <span class="nt">-type</span> d
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that the objects <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find</code> finds are not listed in any particular order.
If we change <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-type d</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-type f</code>,
we get a listing of all the files instead:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>find <span class="nb">.</span> <span class="nt">-type</span> f
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now let’s try matching by name:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>find <span class="nb">.</span> <span class="nt">-name</span> <span class="k">*</span>.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We expected it to find all the text files,
but it only prints out <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./haiku.txt</code>.
The problem is that the shell expands wildcard characters like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> <em>before</em> commands run.
Since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.txt</code> in the current directory expands to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">haiku.txt</code>,
the command we actually ran was:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>find <span class="nb">.</span> <span class="nt">-name</span> haiku.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find</code> did what we asked; we just asked for the wrong thing.</p>

<p>To get what we want,
let’s do what we did with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code>:
put <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.txt</code> in quotes to prevent the shell from expanding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> wildcard.
This way,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find</code> actually gets the pattern <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.txt</code>, not the expanded filename <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">haiku.txt</code>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>find <span class="nb">.</span> <span class="nt">-name</span> <span class="s2">"*.txt"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find</code> can be made to do similar things given the right options,
but under normal circumstances,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> lists everything it can,
while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find</code> searches for things with certain properties and shows them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we said earlier,
the command line’s power lies in combining tools.
We’ve seen how to do that with pipes;
let’s look at another technique.
As we just saw,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find . -name "*.txt"</code> gives us a list of all text files in or below the current directory.
How can we combine that with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc -l</code> to count the lines in all those files?</p>

<p>The simplest way is to put the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find</code> command inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$()</code>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">wc</span> <span class="nt">-l</span> <span class="si">$(</span>find <span class="nb">.</span> <span class="nt">-name</span> <span class="s2">"*.txt"</span><span class="si">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When the shell executes this command,
the first thing it does is run whatever is inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$()</code>.
It then replaces the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$()</code> expression with that command’s output.
Since the output of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find</code> is the four filenames <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./data/one.txt</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./data/LittleWomen.txt</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./data/two.txt</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./haiku.txt</code>, the shell constructs the command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">wc</span> <span class="nt">-l</span> ./data/one.txt ./data/LittleWomen.txt ./data/two.txt ./haiku.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which is what we wanted.
This expansion is exactly what the shell does when it expands wildcards like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code>,
but lets us use any command we want as our own ‘wildcard’.</p>

<p>It’s very common to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code> together.
The first finds files that match a pattern;
the second looks for lines inside those files that match another pattern.
Here, for example, we can find PDB files that contain iron atoms
by looking for the string ‘FE’ in all the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pdb</code> files above the current directory:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="s2">"FE"</span> <span class="si">$(</span>find .. <span class="nt">-name</span> <span class="s2">"*.pdb"</span><span class="si">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

    <p>The correct answer is 1. Putting the match expression in quotes prevents the shell
expanding it, so it gets passed to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find</code> command.</p>

    <p>Option 2 is incorrect because the shell expands <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*s.txt</code> instead of passing the wildcard
expression to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find</code>.</p>

    <p>Option 3 is incorrect because it searches the contents of the files for lines which
do not match ‘net’, rather than searching the file names.</p>

  <p>We have focused exclusively on finding patterns in text files. What if
your data is stored as images, in databases, or in some other format?</p>

  <p>A handful of tools extend <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code> to handle a few non text formats. But a
more generalizable approach is to convert the data to text, or
extract the text-like elements from the data. On the one hand, it makes simple
things easy to do. On the other hand, complex things are usually impossible. For
example, it’s easy enough to write a program that will extract X and Y
dimensions from image files for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code> to play with, but how would you
write something to find values in a spreadsheet whose cells contained
formulas?</p>

  <p>A last option is to recognize that the shell and text processing have
their limits, and to use another programming language.
When the time comes to do this, don’t be too hard on the shell: many
modern programming languages have borrowed a lot of
ideas from it, and imitation is also the sincerest form of praise.</p>

<p>The Unix shell is older than most of the people who use it. It has
survived so long because it is one of the most productive programming
environments ever created — maybe even <em>the</em> most productive. Its syntax
may be cryptic, but people who have mastered it can experiment with
different commands interactively, then use what they have learned to
automate their work. Graphical user interfaces may be easier to use at
first, but once learned, the productivity in the shell is unbeatable.
And as Alfred North Whitehead wrote in 1911, ‘Civilization advances by
extending the number of important operations which we can perform
without thinking about them.’</p>
