<h2 id="comparators">Comparators</h2>

<p>In Python we have the following comparators to do compare two values</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code>: greater than</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;</code>: less than</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==</code>: equal to</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!=</code>: does not equal</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;=</code>: greater than or equal to</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;=</code>: less than or equal to</li>
</ul>

<p>They’re all “binary” comparators, we can only compare two values at a time.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">37</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">38</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">38</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">38</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">39</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">38</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These print out <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">False</code>, these are the two possible values of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra"><em>boolean</em></a> datatype in Python.</p>

<p>We can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;=</code> to check if it’s less than or equal to:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">19</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">21</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==</code> for comparing numbers in Python</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>print(11 == 11)
print(11 != 11)
print(22 != 33)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And now that we can compare numbers, we can start doing useful things with them!</p>

<h2 id="conditionals">Conditionals</h2>

<p>We can ask Python to take different actions, depending on a condition, with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> statement:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">37</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">greater</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">not greater</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">done</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The second line of this code uses the keyword <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> to tell Python that we want to make a choice.
If the test that follows the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> statement is true,
the body of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code>
(i.e., the set of lines indented underneath it) is executed, and “greater” is printed.
If the test is false,
the body of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">else</code> is executed instead, and “not greater” is printed.
Only one or the other is ever executed before continuing on with program execution to print “done”:</p>

<p><a href="../../images/python-flowchart-conditional.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/python-flowchart-conditional.png" alt="A flowchart diagram of the if-else construct that tests if variable num is greater than 100. " width="338" height="268" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

<p>Conditional statements don’t have to include an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">else</code>. If there isn’t one,
Python simply does nothing if the test is false:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">53</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">before conditional...</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s"> is greater than 100</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">...after conditional</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="multiple-branches">Multiple Branches</h2>

<p>But what if you want more branches? What if you need to handle more cases? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">elif</code> to the rescue!</p>

<p>We can chain several tests together using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">elif</code>, which is short for “else if”.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>if todays_temperature &gt; 30:
    print("Wear shorts! Remember your sunscreen")
elif todays_temperature &gt; 20:
    print("It's nice weather finally! Gasp!")
elif todays_temperature &lt; 10:
    print("Time to bundle up!")
else:
    print("Dress normally")
</code></pre></div></div>

  <p>if/elif/else cases follow these rules:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>must start with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code></li>
    <li>can have 0 or more <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">elif</code> conditions</li>
    <li>can have 0 or 1 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">else</code> condition (if no else condition is supplied, it’s equivalent to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">else: &lt;nothing&gt;</code>)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Each of these three sections is a <strong>branch</strong>, the code pauses, and chooses to go down one of the branches based on the conditions.</p>

<p>The following Python code uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">elif</code> to print the sign of a number.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">3</span>

    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s"> is positive</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>NB</strong>: To test for equality we use a double equals sign <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==</code>
rather than a single equals sign <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code> which is used to assign values.</p>

<h2 id="combining-tests">Combining Tests</h2>

<p>We can also combine tests using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">and</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">or</code>.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">and</code> is only true if both parts are true:</p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">False</code> are special words in Python called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">booleans</code>,

the value <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">False</code>, while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-1 &lt; 0</code> returns the value <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">False</code> booleans are not the only values in Python that are true and false.
In fact, <em>any</em> value can be used in an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">elif</code>. This is commonly used to
check, for instance, if a string is empty or if some data is provided:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="sh">''</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">empty string is true</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">word</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">word is true</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also use it to check if a list is empty or full:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">[]:</span>
    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">empty list is true</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]:</span>
    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">non-empty list is true</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1"># The last statement is equivalent to:
</span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="nf">len</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">non-empty list is true</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or you can check if a number is zero, or non-zero:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">zero is true</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">one is true</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="inverting-conditions">Inverting Conditions</h2>

<p>Sometimes it is useful to check whether some condition is not true.
The Boolean operator <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">not</code> can do this explicitly.
After reading and running the code below,
write some <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> statements that use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">not</code> to test the rule

<p>There are two important points here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">20 &lt; x &lt; 40</code> is equivalent to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">20 &lt; x and x &lt; 40</code>, checking both sides of the condition, to make sure it’s greater than one value and smaller than another</li>
  <li>Note that we checked in the second case <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">20 &lt; x</code> and then in the third we had to check <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x &lt;= 20</code>. If we had not had a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;=</code> on one side, what would have happened to 20? It would have gone straight to else!</li>

    <ol>
      <li>No, it won’t. 32 is the only value there that doesn’t print anything. You can either do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x &lt; 57</code> and later <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">57 &lt;= x</code> to test the bigger and smaller values, or you can make use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x &lt; 57</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">56 &lt; x</code>, which have the same results, but <strong>only with integers</strong>. If your code accepted a float, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">56.5</code>, both of those tests would be true. So <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x &lt; 57</code> and later <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">57 &lt;= x</code> is the preferred way to write that.</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">86</code> is the most obvious solution to this, the programmer added a check specifically to see if the value was 86, but instead it’s caught by the previous case.</li>
