> We believe that every learner can **achieve competency with R**. You have reached competency when you find that you are able to **use R to handle common analysis challenges in a reasonable amount of time** (which includes time needed to look at learning materials, search for answers online, and ask colleagues for help). As you spend more time using R (there is no substitute for regular use and practice) you will find yourself gaining competency and even expertise. The more familiar you get, the more complex the analyses you will be able to carry out, with less frustration, and in less time - the fantastic world of R awaits you!

> Nobody wants to learn how to use R. People want to learn how to use R to answer their own research questions! Ok, maybe some folks learn R for R's sake, but these lessons assume that you want to start analyzing genomic data as soon as possible. Given this, there are many valuable pieces of information about R that we simply won't have time to cover. Hopefully, we will clear the hurdle of giving you just enough knowledge to be dangerous, which can be a high bar in R! We suggest you look into the additional learning materials in the box below.

> **Some R skills we will *not* cover in these lessons**
>
> - How to create and work with R matrices and R lists
> - How to create and work with loops and conditional statements, and the "apply" of functions (which are super useful, read more [on this blog about apply functions](https://www.r-bloggers.com/r-tutorial-on-the-apply-family-of-functions/))
> - How to do basic string manipulations (e.g. finding patterns in text using grep, replacing text)
> - How to plot using the default R graphic tools (we *will* cover plot creation, but will do so using the popular plotting package `ggplot2`)
> - How to use advanced R statistical functions

> > The following are good resources for learning more about R. Some of them can be quite technical, but if you are a regular R user you may ultimately need this technical knowledge.
> > - [R for Beginners](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf), by Emmanuel Paradis: a great starting point
> > - [The R Manuals](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html), by the R project people
> > - [R contributed documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html), also linked to the R project, with materials available in several languages
> > - [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/): a wonderful collection by noted R educators and developers Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham
> > - [Practical Data Science for Stats](https://peerj.com/collections/50-practicaldatascistats/): not exclusively about R usage, but a nice collection of pre-prints on data science and applications for R
> > - [Programming in R Software Carpentry lesson](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/): several Software Carpentry lessons in R to choose from
> > - [Data Camp Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r): a fun online learning platform for Data Science, including R.
