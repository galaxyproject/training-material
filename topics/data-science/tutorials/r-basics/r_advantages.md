At more than 20 years old, R is fairly mature and [growing in popularity](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/r/). However, programming isn't a popularity contest. Here are key advantages of analyzing data in R:

- **R is free and [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)**

    R is free - an advantage if you are at an institution where you have to pay for your own MATLAB or SAS license. It is important to your colleagues in parts of the world where expensive software is inaccessible.

    Open source means that you can see and reuse the source. Thanks to that, R is actively developed by a community (see [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/)), and there are regular updates.

- **R is widely used**

    Ok, maybe programming is a popularity contest. Because, R is used in many areas (not just bioinformatics), you are more likely to find help online when you need it. Chances are, almost any error message you run into, someone else has already experienced.

- **R is powerful**

    R runs on multiple platforms (Windows/MacOS/Linux). It can work with much larger datasets than popular spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel, and because of its scripting capabilities is far more reproducible. Also, there are thousands of available software packages for science, including genomics and other areas of life science.
