                <p>Version control is a way of tracking the change history of a project. Even if you have never used a version control tool, you’ve probably already done it manually: copying and renaming project folders (“paper-1.doc”, “paper-2.doc”, etc.) is a form of version control. Within bioinformatics (from research, to development, to sysadmin) a lot of us are using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> as our primary method of source control for everything we do: notes, slides, tutorials, code, notebooks, ansible, system configuration, and more.</p>

<p>Git is a tool that automates and enhances a lot of the tasks that arise when dealing with larger, longer-living, and collaborative projects. It’s also become the common underpinning to many popular online code repositories, GitHub being the most popular.</p>

<p>While it can be used collaboratively, this tutorial focuses on a single-user git repository for the most basic operations.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-you-use-version-control">Why should you use version control?</h2>

<p>If you ask 10 people, you’ll get 10 different answers, but one of the commonalities is that most people don’t realize how integral it is to their development process until they’ve started using it. Still, for the sake of argument, here are some highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>You can undo anything</strong>: Git provides a complete history of every change that has ever been made to your project, timestamped, commented, and attributed. If something breaks, you always have the choice of going back to a previous tate.</li>
  <li><strong>You won’t need to keep undo-ing things</strong>: One of the advantages of using git properly is that by keeping new changes separate from a stable base, you tend to avoid the massive rollbacks associated with constantly tinkering with a single code.</li>
  <li><strong>You can identify exactly when and where changes were made</strong> (and by whom!): Git allows you to pinpoint when a particular piece of code was changed, so finding what other pieces of code a bug might affect or figuring out why a certain expression was added is easy.</li>
  <li><strong>Git forces teams to face conflicts directly</strong>: On a team-based project, many people are often working with the same code. By having a tool which understands when and where files were changed, it’s easy to see when changes might conflict with each other. While it might seem troublesome sometimes to have to deal with conflicts, the alternative—not knowing there’s a conflict—is much more insidious.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="branching">Branching</h2>

<p>Git has the concept of branches which are most often used to manage development over time, before it’s considered final. Until now you’ve seen <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> in your commits and commit logs (or maybe <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> if your git installation is a bit older.)</p>

<p>Oftentimes you’ll see this pattern:</p>

<ol>
  <li>There is a main branch with a lot of history</li>
  <li>You want to test out a new option, new configuration, new script you’re working on
    <ol>
      <li>So you make a branch</li>
      <li>Work on that branch</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>And merge it back into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> branch, once it’s done.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is especially relevant for any project that is shared with others, has a public view, or a deployed version of the code. There you don’t want to affect anyone else using the project, or you don’t want to affect the production deployment, until you’re done making your changes.</p>

<p>Each branch has a different view of the repository, and might have different changes on it. Branches are really useful to keep track of work in progress, until it’s done. In a single user environment however, most people often don’t use them, but once you’re collaborating with other’s they’re incredibly important!</p>

<h3 id="merging">Merging</h3>

<p>Once you’re done with a branch, you can merge it into the main branch. This will take all of the work you did on that branch, and make it part of the main branch.</p>

<p>First, let’s compare the two branches, to see what changed.</p>

<p>This generates a <em>new</em> commit, which reverts the older commit (and probably puts you in a text editor to edit the commit message).
This is not the only way to undo mistakes, but probably the easiest.</p>

<p>If you check your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git log</code> you’ll see the change was undone in a second commit, reverting the first. So if you just look at the current files it appears we never undid it, but within the logs we can see the undo step.</p>

<p>With that you’ve got enough skills to track your own data/code/etc with git!</p>
