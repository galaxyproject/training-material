<h1 id="basics">Basics</h1>

<p>We’ll start by exploring how version control can be used
to keep track of what one person did and when.
Even if you aren’t collaborating with other people,
automated version control is much better than this situation:</p>

<figure id="figure-1" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="../../images/bash-git/phd101212s.png" alt="Cartoon titled 'final'.doc, showing a grad student and their advisor going through multiple revisions. The first named final.doc, then final_rev.2.doc, final_rev.6.comments.doc, a long filename with the revision number 18, until a final filename, revision 22, with special characters indicating frustration where the file name includes the text 'why did I come to grad school'." width="600" height="800" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="../../images/bash-git/phd101212s.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> Piled Higher and Deeper by Jorge Cham, http://www.phdcomics.com</figcaption></figure>

<p>We’ve all been in this situation before: it seems unnecessary to have
multiple nearly-identical versions of the same document. Some word
processors let us deal with this a little better, such as Microsoft
Word’s
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Track-changes-in-Word-197ba630-0f5f-4a8e-9a77-3712475e806a">Track Changes</a>,
Google Docs’ <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843?hl=en">version history</a>, or
LibreOffice’s <a href="https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Recording_and_Displaying_Changes">Recording and Displaying Changes</a>.</p>

<p>Version control systems start with a base version of the document and
then record changes you make each step of the way. You can
think of it as a recording of your progress: you can rewind to start at the base
document and play back each change you made, eventually arriving at your
more recent version.</p>

<p><a href="../../images/bash-git/play-changes.svg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/bash-git/play-changes.svg" alt="Changes Are Saved Sequentially, graphic shows three documents with text being added in each new revision." width="615" height="196" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

<p>Once you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you
can then think about “playing back” different sets of changes on the base document, ultimately
resulting in different versions of that document. For example, two users can make independent
sets of changes on the same document.</p>

<p><a href="../../images/bash-git/versions.svg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/bash-git/versions.svg" alt="Different Versions Can be Saved, showing a document splitting into two, with different changes." width="384" height="354" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

<p>Unless multiple users make changes to the same section of the document - a conflict - you can
incorporate two sets of changes into the same base document.</p>

<p><a href="../../images/bash-git/merge.svg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/bash-git/merge.svg" alt="Multiple Versions Can be Merged, shows two documents with different changes merging into a final document with both changes." width="398" height="382" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

<p>A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us,
effectively creating different versions of our files. It allows us to decide
which changes will be made to the next version (each record of these changes is
called a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#def_commit">commit</a>, and keeps useful metadata
about them. The complete history of commits for a particular project and their
metadata make up a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#def_repository">repository</a>.
Repositories can be kept in sync across different computers, facilitating
collaboration among different people.</p>

  <p>Automated version control systems are nothing new.
Tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System">RCS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System">CVS</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion">Subversion</a> have been around since the early 1980s and are used by
many large companies.
However, many of these are now considered legacy systems (i.e., outdated) due to various
limitations in their capabilities.
More modern systems, such as Git and <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/hg-novice/">Mercurial</a>,
are <em>distributed</em>, meaning that they do not need a centralized server to host the repository.
These modern systems also include powerful merging tools that make it possible for
multiple authors to work on
the same files concurrently.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Imagine you drafted an excellent paragraph for a paper you are writing, but later ruin
it. How would you retrieve the <em>excellent</em> version of your conclusion? Is it even possible?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Imagine you have 5 co-authors. How would you manage the changes and comments
they make to your paper?  If you use LibreOffice Writer or Microsoft Word, what happens if
you accept changes made using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Track Changes</code> option? Do you have a
history of those changes?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Recovering the excellent version is only possible if you created a copy
of the old version of the paper. The danger of losing good versions
often leads to the problematic workflow illustrated in the PhD Comics
cartoon at the top of this page.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Collaborative writing with traditional word processors is cumbersome.
Either every collaborator has to work on a document sequentially
(slowing down the process of writing), or you have to send out a
version to all collaborators and manually merge their comments into
your document. The ‘track changes’ or ‘record changes’ option can
highlight changes for you and simplifies merging, but as soon as you
accept changes you will lose their history. You will then no longer
know who suggested that change, why it was suggested, or when it was
merged into the rest of the document. Even online word processors like
Google Docs or Microsoft Office Online do not fully resolve these
problems.</p>

  <p>The R Console and other interactive tools like RStudio are great for prototyping code and exploring data, but sooner or later we will want to use our program in a pipeline or run it in a shell script to process thousands of data files. This is one of those cases and, in order to do that, we will use the terminal provided by the RStudio itself.
We go to “Tools” and pick the “Shell…” option and we are good to go. Our workspace is the left, terminal window that just opened.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">miniconda</a> is already installed. Miniconda is a package manager that simplifies the installation processes. We can and will use it to install every essential package for our tutorial. However, it is of critical importance that we do that in an new environment within our existing base and install our packages in said environment.</p>

<h1 id="setting-up-git">Setting up git</h1>

<p>When we use Git on a new computer for the first time,
we need to configure a few things. Below are a few examples
of configurations we will set as we get started with Git:</p>

<ul>
  <li>our name and email address,</li>
  <li>what our preferred text editor is,</li>
  <li>and that we want to use these settings globally (i.e. for every project).</li>
</ul>

<p>On a command line, Git commands are written as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git verb options</code>,
where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verb</code> is what we actually want to do and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">options</code> is additional optional information which may be needed for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verb</code>. So here is how
Sherlock sets up his new laptop:</p>

<blockquote class="code-in">
  <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-setting-up-with-bash"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Setting up with bash</div>
  <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>git config <span class="nt">--global</span> user.name <span class="s2">"Sherlock Holmes"</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>git config <span class="nt">--global</span> user.email <span class="s2">"sherlock@baker.street"</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>Please use your own name and email address instead of Sherlocks’s. This user name and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity,
which means that any changes pushed to
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>,
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a>,
<a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> or
another Git host server
after this lesson will include this information.</p>

<p>For this lesson, we will be interacting with <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and so the email address used should be the same as the one used when setting up your GitHub account. If you are concerned about privacy, please review <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/">GitHub’s instructions for keeping your email address private</a>.</p>

  <p>If you choose to use a private email address with GitHub, then use that same email address for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user.email</code> value, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">username@users.noreply.github.com</code> replacing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">username</code> with your GitHub one.</p>

  <p>As with other keys, when you hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd></kbd> or on Macs, <kbd>Return</kbd>, on your keyboard,
your computer encodes this input as a character.
Different operating systems use different character(s) to represent the end of a line.
(You may also hear these referred to as newlines or line breaks.)
Because Git uses these characters to compare files,
it may cause unexpected issues when editing a file on different machines.
Though it is beyond the scope of this lesson, you can read more about this issue
<a href="https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration#_core_autocrlf">in the Pro Git book</a>.</p>

  <p>You can change the way Git recognizes and encodes line endings
using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">core.autocrlf</code> command to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git config</code>.
The following settings are recommended:</p>

<p>Git (2.28+) allows configuration of the name of the branch created when you
initialize any new repository.  Sherlock decides to use that feature to set it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> so
it matches the cloud service he will eventually use.</p>

  <p>Source file changes are associated with a “branch.”
For new learners in this lesson, it’s enough to know that branches exist, and this lesson uses one branch.
By default, Git will create a branch called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>
when you create a new repository with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git init</code> (as explained in the next Episode). This term evokes
the racist practice of human slavery and the
<a href="https://github.com/github/renaming">software development community</a>  has moved to adopt
more inclusive language.</p>

  <p>In 2020, most Git code hosting services transitioned to using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> as the default
branch. As an example, any new repository that is opened in GitHub and GitLab default
to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>.  However, Git has not yet made the same change.  As a result, local repositories
must be manually configured have the same main branch name as most cloud services.</p>

  <p>For versions of Git prior to 2.28, the change can be made on an individual repository level.  The
command for this is in the next episode.  Note that if this value is unset in your local Git
configuration, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">init.defaultBranch</code> value defaults to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The five commands we just ran above only need to be run once: the flag <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--global</code> tells Git
to use the settings for every project, in your user account, on this computer.</p>

<p>You can check your settings at any time:</p>

<p>Once Git is configured,
we can start using it.</p>

<p>We will continue with the story of Sherlock who is investigating a crime and is collecting information about suspects.</p>

<p><a href="../../images/bash-git/sherlock_git.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/bash-git/sherlock_git.png" alt="Cartoon of sherlock examining the git logo with his magnifying glass." width="968" height="864" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

<p>First, let’s create a directory for our work and then move into that directory:</p>

<blockquote class="code-in">
  <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-create-a-workspace"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Create a workspace</div>
  <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">mkdir </span>suspects
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>suspects
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>Then we tell Git to make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">suspects</code> a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#def_repository">repository</a>
– a place where Git can store versions of our files:</p>

<blockquote class="code-in">
  <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-turn-our-workspace-into-directory"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Turn our workspace into directory</div>
  <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>git init
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>It is important to note that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git init</code> will create a repository that
includes subdirectories and their files—there is no need to create
separate repositories nested within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">suspects</code> repository, whether
subdirectories are present from the beginning or added later. Also, note
that the creation of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">suspects</code> directory and its initialization as a
repository are completely separate processes.</p>

<p>If we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> to show the directory’s contents,
it appears that nothing has changed:</p>

<blockquote class="code-in">
  <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-show-directory-content"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Show directory content</div>
  <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">ls</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>But if we add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-a</code> flag to show everything,
we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">suspects</code> called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git</code>:</p>

<blockquote class="code-in">
  <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-show-everything-in-our-directory"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Show everything in our directory</div>
  <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">ls</span> <span class="nt">-a</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="code-out">

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.	..	.git
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>Git uses this special subdirectory to store all the information about the project,
including all files and sub-directories located within the project’s directory.
If we ever delete the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git</code> subdirectory, we will lose the project’s history.</p>

<p>Next, we will change the default branch to be called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>.
This might be the default branch depending on your settings and version
of git.</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Switched to a new branch 'main'
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>We can check that everything is set up correctly
by asking Git to tell us the status of our project:</p>

<blockquote class="code-in">
  <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-check"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Check</div>
  <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>git status

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>On branch main

<p>If you are using a different version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code>, the exact
wording of the output might be slightly different.</p>

<h2 id="places-to-create-git-repositories">Places to Create Git Repositories</h2>

<p>Along with tracking information about suspects (the project we have already created), Sherlock would also like to track information specific clues. So, Sherlock creates a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clues</code> project inside his <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">suspects</code> project with the following sequence of commands:</p>

    <p>No. Sherlock does not need to make the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clues</code> subdirectory a Git repository
because the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">suspects</code> repository will track all files, sub-directories, and
subdirectory files under the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">suspects</code> directory.  Thus, in order to track
all information about clues, Sherlock only needed to add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clues</code> subdirectory
to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">suspects</code> directory.</p>

  <p>Additionally, Git repositories can interfere with each other if they are “nested”:
the outer repository will try to version-control
the inner repository. Therefore, it’s best to create each new Git
repository in a separate directory. To be sure that there is no conflicting
repository in the directory, check the output of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git status</code>. If it looks
like the following, you are good to go to create a new repository as shown
above:</p>

<h2 id="correcting-git-init-mistakes">Correcting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git init</code> Mistakes</h2>
<p>Dr. Watson explains to Sherlock how a nested repository is redundant and may cause confusion down the road. Sherlock would like to remove the nested repository. How can Sherlock undo his last <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git init</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clues</code> subdirectory?</p>

<h3 id="use-rm-with-caution">USE <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm</code> WITH CAUTION!</h3>

<p>Removing files from a Git repository needs to be done with caution. But we have not learned yet how to tell Git to track a particular file; we will learn this in the next episode. Files that are not tracked by Git can easily be removed like any other “ordinary” files with</p>

</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly a directory can be removed using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm -r dirname</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm -rf dirname</code>. If the files or folder being removed in this fashion are tracked by Git, then their removal becomes another change that we will need to track, as we will see later.</p>

<p>Git keeps all of its files in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git</code> directory. To recover from this little mistake, Sherlock can just remove the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git</code> folder in the clues subdirectory by running the following command from inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">suspects</code> directory:</p>

<blockquote class="code-in">
  <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-remove-the-git-folder"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Remove the `.git` folder</div>

<p>But be careful! Running this command in the wrong directory will remove the entire Git history of a project you might want to keep. Therefore, always check your current directory using the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code>.</p>

<h1 id="tracking-changes">Tracking Changes</h1>

<p>Let’s create a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">colonel.txt</code> that contains some notes about the colonel Smith’s connection to the case.
We’ll use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code> to edit the file;
you can use whatever editor you like.
In particular, this does not have to be the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">core.editor</code> you set globally earlier. But remember, the bash command to create or edit a new file will depend on the editor you choose (it might not be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code>). For a refresher on text editors, check out <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/">“Which Editor?”</a> in <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/">The Unix Shell</a> lesson.</p>

<p>The “untracked files” message means that there’s a file in the directory that Git isn’t keeping track of. We can tell Git to track a file using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add</code>:</p>

<p>Git now knows that it’s supposed to keep track of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">colonel.txt</code>, but it hasn’t recorded these changes as a commit yet. To get it to do that, we need to run one more command:</p>

<p>When we run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit</code>,
Git takes everything we have told it to save by using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add</code>
and stores a copy permanently inside the special <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git</code> directory.
This permanent copy is called a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#def_commit">commit</a>
(or <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#def_revision">revision</a>) and its short identifier is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f22b25e</code>. Your commit may have another identifier.</p>

<p>We use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-m</code> flag (for “message”)
to record a short, descriptive, and specific comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why.
If we just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit</code> without the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-m</code> option,
Git will launch <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code> (or whatever other editor we configured as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">core.editor</code>)
so that we can write a longer message.</p>

<p><a href="https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">Good commit messages</a> start with a brief &lt;50 characters) statement about the
changes made in the commit. Generally, the message should complete the sentence “If applied, this commit will” <commit message="" here="">.
If you want to go into more detail, add a blank line between the summary line and your additional notes. Use this additional space to explain why you made changes and/or what their impact will be.</commit></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git log</code> lists all commits  made to a repository in reverse chronological order.
The listing for each commit includes
the commit’s full identifier
(which starts with the same characters as
the short identifier printed by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit</code> command earlier),
the commit’s author,
when it was created,
and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.</p>

  <p>If we run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> at this point, we will still see just one file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">colonel.txt</code>.

<p>Now suppose Sherlock adds more information to the file.

<p>When we run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git status</code> now,

<p>The last line is the key phrase:
“no changes added to commit”.
We have changed this file,
but we haven’t told Git we will want to save those changes
(which we do with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add</code>)
nor have we saved them (which we do with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit</code>).
So let’s do that now. It is good practice to always review
our changes before saving them. We do this using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git diff</code>.
This shows us the differences between the current state
of the file and the most recently saved version:</p>

<blockquote class="code-in">

<p>The output is cryptic because
it is actually a series of commands for tools like editors and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">patch</code>
telling them how to reconstruct one file given the other.
If we break it down into pieces:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first line tells us that Git is producing output similar to the Unix <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diff</code> command
comparing the old and new versions of the file.</li>
  <li>The second line tells exactly which versions of the file
Git is comparing;
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">df0654a</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">315bf3a</code> are unique computer-generated labels for those versions.</li>
  <li>The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed.</li>
  <li>The remaining lines are the most interesting, they show us the actual differences
and the lines on which they occur.
In particular,
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> marker in the first column shows where we added a line.</li>
</ol>

<p>After reviewing our change, it’s time to commit it:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Git insists that we add files to the set we want to commit
before actually committing anything. This allows us to commit our
changes in stages and capture changes in logical portions rather than
only large batches.
For example,
suppose we’re adding a few citations to relevant research to our thesis.
We might want to commit those additions,
and the corresponding bibliography entries,
but <em>not</em> commit some of our work drafting the conclusion
(which we haven’t finished yet).</p>

<p>To allow for this,
Git has a special <em>staging area</em>
where it keeps track of things that have been added to
the current <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#def_changeset">changeset</a>
but not yet committed.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <div class="box-title tip-title" id="tip-staging-area"><button class="gtn-boxify-button tip" type="button" aria-controls="tip-staging-area" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Tip: Staging Area</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p>If you think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the life of a project,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add</code> specifies <em>what</em> will go in a snapshot
(putting things in the staging area),
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit</code> then <em>actually takes</em> the snapshot, and
makes a permanent record of it (as a commit).
If you don’t have anything staged when you type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit</code>,
Git will prompt you to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit -a</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit --all</code>,
which is kind of like gathering <em>everyone</em> to take a group photo!
However, it’s almost always better to
explicitly add things to the staging area, because you might
commit changes you forgot you made. (Going back to the group photo simile,
you might get an extra with incomplete makeup walking on
the stage for the picture because you used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-a</code>!)
Try to stage things manually,
or you might find yourself searching for “git undo commit” more
than you would like!</p>

<p>Let’s watch as our changes to a file move from our editor
to the staging area

First,
we’ll add another line to the file:</p>

<p>So far, so good:
we’ve added one line to the end of the file
(shown with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> in the first column).
Now let’s put that change in the staging area
and see what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git diff</code> reports:</p>

  <p>Two important facts you should know about directories in Git.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Git does not track directories on their own, only files within them.
Try it for yourself:</p>

      <blockquote class="code-in">
        <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-test-directory-tracking"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Test directory tracking</div>
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">mkdir </span>mysteries
<span class="nv">$ </span>git status
<span class="nv">$ </span>git add mysteries
<span class="nv">$ </span>git status
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Note, our newly created empty directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mysteries</code> does not appear in
the list of untracked files even if we explicitly add it (<em>via</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add</code>) to our
repository. This is the reason why you will sometimes see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitkeep</code> files
in otherwise empty directories. Unlike <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code>, these files are not special
and their sole purpose is to populate a directory so that Git adds it to
the repository. In fact, you can name such files anything you like.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If you create a directory in your Git repository and populate it with files,
you can add all files in the directory at once by:</p>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> git add &lt;directory-with-files&gt;
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>Try it for yourself:</p>
      <blockquote class="code-in">
        <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-add-multiple-files"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Add multiple files</div>
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">touch </span>mysteries/belgravia mysteries/reichenbachfall
<span class="nv">$ </span>git status
<span class="nv">$ </span>git add mysteries
<span class="nv">$ </span>git status
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Before moving on, we will commit these changes.</p>

      <blockquote class="code-in">
        <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-commit-the-new-changes"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Commit the new changes</div>
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git commit -m "Add some initial thoughts on mysteries"
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ol>

</blockquote>

<p>To recap, when we want to add changes to our repository,
we first need to add the changed files to the staging area
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add</code>) and then commit the staged changes to the
repository (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit</code>):</p>

  <ol>
    <li>“Changes”</li>

    <p>Answer 1 is not descriptive enough, and the purpose of the commit is unclear;
and answer 2 is redundant to using “git diff” to see what changed in this commit;

<p>which is the same as what you would get if you leave out <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HEAD</code> (try it).  The
real goodness in all this is when you can refer to previous commits.  We do
that by adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~1</code>
(where “~” is “tilde”, pronounced [<strong>til</strong>-d<em>uh</em>])
to refer to the commit one before <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HEAD</code>.</p>

<p>In this way,
we can build up a chain of commits.
The most recent end of the chain is referred to as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HEAD</code>;
we can refer to previous commits using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> notation,
so <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HEAD~1</code>
means “the previous commit”,
while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HEAD~123</code> goes back 123 commits from where we are now.</p>

<p>We can also refer to commits using
those long strings of digits and letters
that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git log</code> displays.
These are unique IDs for the changes,
and “unique” really does mean unique:
every change to any set of files on any computer
has a unique 40-character identifier.
Our first commit was given the ID
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b</code>,
so let’s try this:</p>

<p>All right! So
we can save changes to files and see what we’ve changed. Now, how
can we restore older versions of things?
Let’s suppose we change our mind about the last update to

<p>As you might guess from its name,

  <p>The “detached HEAD” is like “look, but don’t touch” here,
so you shouldn’t make any changes in this state.
After investigating your repo’s past state, reattach your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HEAD</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git checkout main</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s important to remember that
we must use the commit number that identifies the state of the repository
<em>before</em> the change we’re trying to undo.
A common mistake is to use the number of
the commit in which we made the change we’re trying to discard.
In the example below, we want to retrieve the state from before the most
recent commit (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HEAD~1</code>), which is commit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f22b25e</code>:</p>

<p>So, to put it all together,
here’s how Git works in cartoon form:</p>

<p><a href="../../images/bash-git/git_staging.svg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/bash-git/git_staging.svg" alt="https://figshare.com/articles/How_Git_works_a_cartoon/1328266. " width="551" height="407" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

  <p>If you read the output of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git status</code> carefully,
you’ll see that it includes this hint:</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>As it says,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git checkout</code> without a version identifier restores files to the state saved in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HEAD</code>.
The double dash <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--</code> is needed to separate the names of the files being recovered
from the command itself:
without it,
Git would try to use the name of the file as the commit identifier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that files can be reverted one by one
tends to change the way people organize their work.
If everything is in one large document,
it’s hard (but not impossible) to undo changes to the introduction
without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion.
If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files,
on the other hand,
moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.</p>

    <p>The answer is (5)-Both 2 and 4.</p>

    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">checkout</code> command restores files from the repository, overwriting the files in your working
directory. Answers 2 and 4 both restore the <em>latest</em> version <em>in the repository</em> of the file
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data_cruncher.py</code>. Answer 2 uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HEAD</code> to indicate the <em>latest</em>, whereas answer 4 uses the
unique ID of the last commit, which is what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HEAD</code> means.</p>

    <p>Answer 3 gets the version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data_cruncher.py</code> from the commit <em>before</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HEAD</code>, which is NOT
what we wanted.</p>

    <p>Answer 1 can be dangerous! Without a filename, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git checkout</code> will restore <strong>all files</strong>
in the current directory (and all directories below it) to their state at the commit specified.
This command will restore <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data_cruncher.py</code> to the latest commit version, but it will also
restore <em>any other files that are changed</em> to that version, erasing any changes you may
have made to those files!
As discussed above, you are left in a <em>detached</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HEAD</code> state, and you don’t want to be there.</p>

    <p>The answer is 2.</p>

    <p>The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add judge.txt</code> places the current version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">judge.txt</code> into the staging area.
The changes to the file from the second <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo</code> command are only applied to the working copy,
not the version in the staging area.</p>

    <p>So, when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit -m "Comment on judge as an unsuitable base"</code> is executed,
the version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">judge.txt</code> committed to the repository is the one from the staging area and
has only one line.</p>

    <p>At this time, the working copy still has the second line (and
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git status</code> will show that the file is modified). However, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git checkout HEAD judge.txt</code>
 replaces the working copy with the most recently committed version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">judge.txt</code>.</p>

    <p>So, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat judge.txt</code> will output</p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git checkout</code> can be used to restore a previous commit when unstaged changes have
been made, but will it also work for changes that have been staged but not committed?
Make a change to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">colonel.txt</code>, add that change, and use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git checkout</code> to see if
you can remove your change.</p>

  <div class="box-title question-title" id="question-explore-and-summarize-histories"><i class="far fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Question: Explore and Summarize Histories</div>

  <p>Exploring history is an important part of Git, and often it is a challenge to find
the right commit ID, especially if the commit is from several months ago.</p>

  <p>Imagine the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">suspects</code> project has more than 50 files.
You would like to find a commit that modifies some specific text in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">colonel.txt</code>.
When you type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git log</code>, a very long list appeared.
How can you narrow down the search?</p>

  <blockquote class="solution">
    <div class="box-title solution-title" id="solution-9"><button class="gtn-boxify-button solution" type="button" aria-controls="solution-9" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Solution</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>
    <p>Recall that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git diff</code> command allows us to explore one specific file,
e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git diff colonel.txt</code>. We can apply a similar idea here.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git log colonel.txt
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Unfortunately some of these commit messages are very ambiguous, e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">update files</code>.
How can you search through these files?</p>

    <p>Both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git diff</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git log</code> are very useful and they summarize a different part of the history
for you.
Is it possible to combine both? Let’s try the following:</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git log --patch colonel.txt
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>You should get a long list of output, and you should be able to see both commit messages and
the difference between each commit.</p>

    <p>Question: What does the following command do?</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git log --patch HEAD~9 *.txt
</code></pre></div>    </div>
