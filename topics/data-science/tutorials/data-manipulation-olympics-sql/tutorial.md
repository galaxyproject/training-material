key_points:
- Basic data manipulation is often needed between steps in a larger scientific analysis in order to connect outputs from one tool to input of another.
- There are often multiple ways/tools to achieve the same end result
- Having a basic understanding of data manipulation tools will make it easier to do exploratory data analysis
- Always read the help text of the tool before using it to get a full understanding of its workings
- Always try to formulate the output you are expecting from a tool. This will make it easier to spot mistakes as soon as possible.

Scientific analyses often consist of a number of tools that run one after the other, in order to go from the raw data to scientific insight. Between these specialized tools, simple data manipulation steps are often needed as a kind of "glue" between tools. For example, the output of tool A may produce a file that contains all the information needed as input for tool B, but tool B expects the columns in a different order. Or in genomic data analysis, some tools expect chromosome X to be listed as `chrX`, while others simply expect `X`. In these situations, extra data manipulation steps are needed to prepare files for input to analysis tools.

<!--
Note to contributors: feel free to add sections here to include additional data manipulation options.
Make sure each section is independent of each other, i.e. each section should start with the olympics.tsv file.
Also make sure to include many exercises (with answers) for your section!
-->


Galaxy has a large collection of tools to perform such basic data manipulation tasks, and becoming familiar with these operations will allow to perform your analysis more easily in Galaxy (and outside).

# Cheatsheet

Here is an overview table of the different data manipulations in this tutorial, with links to the tools in Galaxy.

In this tutorial, these functions are explained in more detail, and we provide some exercises for you to practice.

# Background

In this tutorial, we will use as our dataset a table with results from the Olympics, from the games in Athens in 1896 until Tokyo in 2020. The objective is to familiarize you with a large number of the most important data manipulation tools in Galaxy. Much like the Olympics, there are many different disciplines (types of operations), and for each operation there are often multiple techniques (tools) available to athletes (data analysts, you) that are great for achieving the goal.


![image of olympic rings, logo and two athletes around the words "Data Analysis Olympics"]({% link topics/introduction/tutorials/data-manipulation-olympics/images/cover.jpg %})


We will show you many of these commonly needed data manipulation operations, and some examples of how to perform them in Galaxy. We also provide many exercises so that you can train your skills and become a data manipulation Olympian!

# Preamble
```sql
# This preamble sets up the sql "magic" for jupyter. Use %%sql in your cells to write sql!
!python3 -m pip install ipython-sql sqlalchemy
!wget -c {{page.zenodo_link}}/files/olympics.db
import sqlalchemy
engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine("sqlite:///olympics.db")
%load_ext sql
%sql sqlite:///olympics.db
%config SqlMagic.displaycon=False
```

# Download Data

Before we can do any manipulation, we will need some data. Let's download our table with Olympics results now.

```sql
SELECT * FROM olympics LIMIT 10;
```

And now we can start querying the database:

```sql
SELECT
    name
FROM
    sqlite_schema
```

## About this dataset

The data was [obtained](https://github.com/UOSCS/Olympic_Athletes) from [Olympedia](https://www.olympedia.org/). The `olympics` table contains
234,522 rows and 17 columns. Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual Olympic event. The columns are:

- **athlete_id** - Unique number for each athlete
- **name** - Athlete's name
- **sex** - M or F
- **birth_year** - 4-digit number
- **birth_day** - e.g. 24 July
- **birth_place** - town and/or country
- **height** - In centimeters (or `NA` if data not known)
- **weight** - In kilograms (or `NA` if data not known)
- **team** - Team name
- **noc** - National Olympic Committee 3-letter code
- **games** - Year and season
- **year** - Integer
- **season** - Summer or Winter
- **city** - Host city
- **sport** - Sport
- **event** - Event
- **medal** - Gold, Silver, Bronze (or `NA` if no medal was won)

We will use this dataset to practice our data manipulation skills in Galaxy.


# Choose your adventure!

This tutorial is structured a bit differently than most. **You do not have to do the steps in the order they are presented below.** Every section in this tutorial uses the dataset you just uploaded (the `olympics.db` file) as input, so you can jump to any section in this tutorial right now if you have a particular data manipulation operation in mind you want to learn more about.

# Sorting

We have a lot of data in this file, but it is ordered by the athlete ID number, which is a somewhat arbitrary and meaningless number. But we can sort the rows in this file to something more convenient, for example alphabetically by name of the athlete, or chronologically by year of the Olympics.

In `SQL` we can use the `ORDER BY` clause. We'll start by limiting our results, as every table in this dataset is quite large.

```sql
SELECT NOC, `CLDR display name` FROM countries LIMIT 30;
```

You can use `ORDER BY column-name ASC` or `ORDER BY column-name DESC` to sort the data ascending or descending.

```sql
SELECT NOC, `CLDR display name` FROM countries ORDER BY NOC ASC LIMIT 30;
```

```sql
SELECT NOC, `CLDR display name` FROM countries ORDER BY NOC DESC LIMIT 30;
```

So let's sort our file in chronological order, based on the year of the Olympic games:

> <question-title></question-title>
>
> 1. Which column contains the year?
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> >
> > 1. `year`
> >
> {: .solution}
{: .question}

```sql
SELECT * FROM olympics ORDER BY year LIMIT 30;
```

If we wanted to do it in reverse, we could just use `order by year desc`

```sql
SELECT * FROM olympics ORDER BY year DESC LIMIT 30;
```

> <question-title></question-title>
>
> 1. Write a query to access only the first entry.
> 2. Which athlete is listed at the top of the file now?
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> > 1. We can use `LIMIT` for this.
> >    ```sql
> >    select * from olympics order by year limit 1;
> >    ```
> > 1. J. Defert. Who competed in a Tennis event 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens.
> >
> {: .solution}
{: .question}

This is great, but maybe it would make more sense to sort alphabetically by athlete name *within each year*.

## Sort on multiple columns at once

So we want to sort twice, first by year, an then within each year, we sort again alphabetically by name.

We will sort the file in chronological order based on the year of the Olympic games

```sql
SELECT * FROM olympics ORDER BY year, name LIMIT 30;
```

# Filtering

This file contains a lot of data, but we may only be interested in a subset of this data. For example, we may only want to look at one particular Olympics, or one particular sport. In such cases we can filter the dataset. This will create a new dataset, removing any rows that are not of interest to us (i.e. that don't meet the criteria we provide).

We will filter the file to show only winter Olympics
Look at the `olympics` table and answer the following questions

> <question-title></question-title>
>
> 1. Which key contains this information?
> 2. Which values can this column have? (make sure to notice capitalisation, 'Winter' is not the same as 'winter' to these tools)
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> >
> > 1. `season`
> > 2. The values can be `Summer` or `Winter` (`select distinct season from olympics`)
> >
> {: .solution}
{: .question}

We'll be using the `WHERE` filter to select entries matching specific conditions:

> <question-title></question-title>
>
> 1. How would you write the expressions for the following conditions:
>    1. `enrolled` must be 'Yes'
>    2. `age` must be smaller than 75
>    3. `height` cannot be null
>    4. `birthplace` cannot be empty
>
> 2. It is also possible to combine multiple conditions, using `and`, `or`, `not` and parentheses
>    How would you write expressions for the following filtering conditions:
>    1. `height` is larger than 200 or smaller than 160
>    2. `height` is larger than 200 and smaller than 210
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> >
> > 1. The answers are:
> >    1. `select * from olympics where enrolled = 'Yes'`
> >    2. `select * from olympics where age < 75`
> >    3. `select * from olympics where height is not null``
> >    4. `select * from olympics where birthplace != ""`
> >
> > 2. The answers are:
> >    1. `select * from olympics where height > 200 or height < 160`
> >    2. `select * from olympics where height > 200 and height < 210`
> >
> {: .solution}
{: .question}



Ok, great, now that you've got the hang of writing expressions for this tool, let's create a file with only Winter Olympics. Make sure it is contained in an array, in case we want to do further sorting.

```sql
CREATE TABLE winter AS SELECT * FROM olympics WHERE season = 'Winter'
```

>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> >
> > 44,680
> >
> {: .solution}
{: .question}


**Repeat** the step for the Summer Olympics

```sql
CREATE TABLE summer AS SELECT * FROM olympics WHERE season = 'Summer'
```

> <question-title></question-title>
>

> >
> > 1. The original file has 234,522 entries, and the Winter Olympics had 44,680 entries. So we would expect 234,522 - 44,680 = 189,842 rows of data.

# Counting

A common operation we might want to perform on tables of data, is simple counting. How many times does a certain value appear? For our dataset for instance, we might want to know how many countries participated in each Olympics, how many women, etc; any column that has categorical data that we can count.

Let's start by simply counting how many different Olympic Games we have in our dataset, and how many times it appears (so how many participations there were each year)

We'll need to use the `group by` syntax which takes a key, and then groups by those values.

> <question-title></question-title>
>
> 1. How many different Olympic games are in our file?
> 2. Which Olympic games had the most participations? (Tip: use order by)

{: .question}

You may have guessed that like `order by`, that we could have selected multiple columns in the `group by` step. This lets us count on combinations of columns.

Let's try counting the number of men and women in each olympic games.

```sql
select count(*), games, sex from olympics group by games, sex
```

> <question-title></question-title>
>
> You see the resulting file has a line for every combination of the two columns (games and sex), providing the count for each.
>
> 1. How many women were in the first Olympic games?
>
> 2. Which Olympic games had the most women participants?
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> >
> > 1. 2 women participated in the 1896 Olympics. (note that we cannot be sure if this is two different women, or 1 woman participating twice, in this query. Do you know any way we could query that? Try it out!)
> >    The results looks something like this:
> >    ```
> >    2	F	1896 Summer Olympics
> >    43	F	1900 Summer Olympics
> >    17	F	1904 Summer Olympics
> >    55	F	1908 Summer Olympics
> >    97	F	1912 Summer Olympics
> >    132	F	1920 Summer Olympics
> >    269	F	1924 Summer Olympics
> >    ```
> >
> > 2. 2020 Summer Olympics (4652)
> >
> {: .solution}
{: .question}

Let's say we wanted to know how many different sports there were in each Olympics. If we used the counting query above, we would get resultsfor each combination of sport and olympics, with the number of lines (participations) of each. But we don't really care about the number of lines that have this combination, just the total number of unique sports in each games.

We can use the `distinct` filter in our pipeline to discover this. First let's do our group by and iterate over each resulting group:

```sql
select games, sport from olympics group by games;
```

And let's count all of their appearances

```sql
select games, count(sport) as sports from olympics group by games;
```

But those results still aren't distinct, those numbers are far too high. So let's use distinct:

```sql
select games, count(distinct sport) as sports from olympics group by games;
```

We're almost there! Let's sort this

```sql
select games, count(distinct sport) as sports from olympics group by games order by sports asc;
```

> <question-title></question-title>
>
> 2. How many sport were in the first Olympics? How many in the latest?
> 3. Which Olympics had the most different sports?
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> >
> > 2. 10 and 38.
> > 3. The 2020 Summer Olympics had the most different sports (38)
> >
> {: .solution}
{: .question}

Save the output as something descriptive.

# Grouping

Often we may want to group rows based on a value in a column, and perform some operation on the resulting rows. For example we would like to group the olympics data by one value (e.g. year, country, sport), and determine some value for each group (e.g. number of medals won, average age of athletes, etc).

In the [counting](#counting) section of this tutorial we show how to get answers that require a count (e.g. number of medals won), but sometimes we want to do something more complex, like calculating the average height of athletes in a group, say per country or per sport. This section will show some example of these types of questions.

We can use continue to use group by for this, but now we'll need the max and min aggregate operations. Essentially every time we use `group by` we need to use an aggregation like finding the maximum, minimum, or counting the number of results.

> <hands-on-title>Tallest athlete per sport</hands-on-title>
>
> We would like to answer the following question: *How tall was the tallest athlete of each sport?*
>
> > <question-title></question-title>

> > > 2. Our dataset had quite a number of `null` (unknown) values in the height column, especially for the earlier Olympics. These are preserved in the outputs.
> > {: .solution}
> {: .question}
{: .hands_on}


## Grouping on multiple columns

You may have noticed that we could also provide multiple columns to group on. If we do this, we can compute values for combinations of groups, such as sex and sport, to find e.g. the tallest woman in basketball or the shortest man per Olympics. There are also many more options for the computation we perform, so perhaps we are more interested not in the tallest athlete, but the average height. Let's perform some of these slightly more advanced queries now.

# Computing

Sometimes we want to use the data in our column to compute a new value, and add that to the table. For instance, for our dataset we could caluclate athtletes BMI (using height and weight columns), or their age at time of participation (from year of birth and year of the Olymics). By adding these computed values as a new colum to our datset, we can more easily query the dataset for these values. We can do these types of operations on the fly, and then if we like, store them as (temporary) tables.

As an example, let's calculate the age of each athlete at the time of participation, and add this as a new column to our dataset.

```sql
select year - birth_year as age, games from olympics LIMIT 30;
```

If we want to save that result to make it easier to query, then we have a couple options.

1. Don't store it, calculate on demand. Very storage efficient.

   ```sql
   select noc, name, ..., year - birth_year as age from olympics
   ```

1. Create a temporary table with this data, great if we only need it temporarily

   ```sql
   create temporary table olympics_ages as select *, year - birth_year as age from olympics
   ```

2. Create a new permanent table with this data

   ```sql
   create table olympics_ages as select *, year - birth_year as age from olympics
   ```

3. Update the existing table by adding it as a new column

   ```sql
   alter table olympics add column age int;
   update olympics set age = year - birth_year;
   ```

This was a simple computation, but much more complex mathematical expressions can be computed with this tool. In the exercise below, we will compute the BMI for each athlete as an example.


## Exercises

BMI stands for Body Mass Index, is a metric to provide a very crude measure of how healthy your weight is. The formula to compute BMI is:

$$ BMI = weight / (height^2) $$

(with weight in kilograms and height in meters).

> <tip-title>BMI is problematic</tip-title>
> [Adolphe Quetelet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolphe_Quetelet), who invented [BMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index), was not a doctor of medicine, instead he was a Belgian astronomer, mathematician, statistician, and sociologist. His data consisted probably entirely of cisgender, white, european men and women {% cite Eknoyan_2007 %}.
> In his defense, he did argue it should not be used at individual levels, however it came to be used as such due to simplicity. (See [Wikipedia's History section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index#History)). BMI is a poor measure of health, especially for populations with high muscle content, and cannot be simply re-used as-is with anyone other than Anglo Saxons {% cite Caleyachetty_2021 %}, [Wikipedia:Limitations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index#Limitations).
>
> However as it is an easy to calculate metric, we include the calculation here.

# Find and Replace

Often you may need to change the contents of a file a bit to fit the expectations of an analysis tool. For instance, our database uses `null` for missing values, but other conventions included leaving the cell empty instead. Or, when working with chromosomal data, you may need to add or remove the `chr` prefix from a column before using it as input to a certain tool. In such situations, we can find all occurrences of a certain pattern in our file, and replace it with another value.

If we want to perform such a replacement on a single column in our data, we can use an update statement.

A few of the basics of regular expression, plus some links to further resources are given in the box below:

{% snippet faqs/galaxy/analysis_regular_expressions.md %}

Let's start with a simple example:
Our file uses a mix of `Athina` and `Athens` to indicate the Capital City of Greece in the `city` column.
Let's standardize this by replacing occurrences of `Athina` with `Athens`.

Let's start by filtering out the old spelling:

```sql
select * from olympics where city = 'Athina' limit 30;
```

Let's try replacing it:

```sql
update olympics
set city = 'Athens'
where city = 'Athina';
```

Look at the file before and after. Athlete 7 (Patrick Chila) near the top of the `olympics.tsv` file, had a value of Athina in the city column. Verify that it has been changed to Athens.

This was rather simple example, so let's try a few more examples with slightly more complex expressions.

## Exercises

You may have noticed that our file has a lot of missing data. Especially for the earlier years, things like height, weight and birthday of athletes was not registered, or simply not known. In some columns you see these missing values have been replaced with an `NA` (not available) value. In other columns (for example birth place), the cells have simply been left empty.

Different tools may expect different ways of handling missing data. So you may have to change your missing data from empty to `NA`, `NaN`, or something else, between analysis steps

> We will now replace empty cells in the `birth_place` column, to use `null` instead.

> {: .solution}
>
{: .hands_on}

Let's do another example, this one splitting and re-constructing strings.

Look at the `birth_day` column. It has values in a format like `12 December`. Suppose we have a tool that expects this data to be in the reverse format, `December 12`. We would not want to do this manually, but with sql we can make this replacement easily

We will now change the format in birthday column from `day month` to `month day`, as our boss is American and requested the silly format.

First we need to understand that sqlite does not ship a regex engine, thus we cannot use familiar regular expressions. Instead we can make use of `instr(string, search)` to find the location of a substring like ` `, identifying where the day stops and the month starts. Then we can use `substr(string, start)` and `substr(string, start, end)` to chop up our date string.

In SQL, concatenation is done with `||`.

# Removing Columns

In sqlite you cannot remove columns, it is not supported. Proper databases like Postgres and MySQL support this operation.
Instead for sqlite you could select the columns you want to keep, create a new table from that, and then delete the original table.

Other databases:

```
alter table delete column NAME from olympics
```

# Unique

Sometimes, in the course of our data manipulations, we may end up with a file that has duplicate values. In order to filter these out, we can use the `distinct` filter.

Let's say we would like to create a list of all unique athletes (id and name).

First we will just select the `athlete_id` and `name` columns from our dataset

```sql
select name, athlete_id from olympics LIMIT 30
```

> <question-title></question-title>
>
> 1. Do you see duplication? Why is that?
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> >
> > 1. Yes. For all athletes who participated more than once, the row will be identical.
> >
> {: .solution}
{: .question}

Now let's remove those duplicates.

```sql
select distinct name, athlete_id from olympics limit 30
```

> <question-title></question-title>
>
> How many unique athletes do we have? Note that you cannot count multiple columns, so choose one that is correct.

{: .question}


# Joining Datasets

This database contains a lot of information, but we may want to add more information. For example if we had a file with information about each country (population, capital city, etc), we could join that information with our Olympics data, to get a single result with all information in every row.

For example, if we would like to be able to group by continent, to e.g. count athletes, medals etc per continent, we will have to add a `continent` column to our file. To do this we would need a second file that maps each country to the corresponding continent. This is what we will do in the next hands-on section.

We obtained country information data from [DataHub](https://datahub.io/core/country-codes). More information about this file can be found in the description there. It has 56 columns with a wide variety of data about each country (from country codes, to capital city, languages spoken, etc)

It is available in the countries table.

>
> 2. Which keys(s) in this file are the same as in the `olympics.tsv` file?

> >
> > 2. Both files have a `NOC` column with the 3-letter country code (`NOC` stands for National Olympic Committee). However, one is lowercase.
> {: .solution}
{: .question}

We would now like to take our Olympics dataset as the basis, and add columns to every row of this file with some information about the country. In order to join, we will need to have one column that is shared between the two files, on which we can match. The `NOC` column is perfect for this because it is a defined standard. Both files also contain a column with the country name in it, which is also a possible candidate to use for joining, but because it is less standardised, it is safer to use the NOC column. For example, if one file uses "Netherlands", while the other uses "The Netherlands" to indicate the same country, the joining will fail for these rows. So always make sure the columns you join on are compatible!

We can use the join commands.

```sql
select * from olympics left join countries on olympics.noc = countries.NOC LIMIT 30
```

# Concatenating

Concatenation of two files simple means putting the contents of the two files together, one after the other. Our dataset was created in 2021, but since then we've had another Olympic event, the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. If we have the same data for this latest Olympics, we could simply add the rows from the 2022 games to our current file with data, in order to create a single file with all data from 1896 to 2022.

View the table `olympics_2022`, does it have the same structure as our original `olympics` table?

> <question-title></question-title>
>
> 1. Does the new table have the same structure?
> 2. Can we simply add the lines of the new table to the end of our existing olympics dataset?
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> > 1. Yes, this file has all the same columns, in the same order, so concatenation should be relatively straightforward.
> > 2. Yes.
> >
> {: .solution}
{: .question}

Since this new dataset has the exact same structure (number and order of columns), we can simple add the lines from this file to the end of our existing `olympic` table.
For this, we'll need to use the `union all` which takes two separate sql queries and unifies the results.

```sql
select * from olympics
union all
select * from olympics_2022
LIMIT 30;
```

(Note: We are limiting the outputs to ensure your browser does not crash loading all of the data.)

Now this only works so simply because our two datasets had the same structure. If your data comes from different sources, you may have to do some additional data manipulation before you can union, e.g. to make sure the columns match, or how each file deals with missing data (empty cells, `NA`, `NaN` or something else).

# Conclusion

These operations covered in the tutorial are just a few examples of some of the most common operations. There are many more available. We encourage you to look around the documentation of sqlite or your database. The more comfortable you are performing these kinds of steps, the more you can get out of SQL!

# Exercises: Putting it all together!

This section provides a number of exercises that require you to combine two or more of the techniques you learned in this tutorial. This is a great way to practice your data manipulation skills. Full solutions are provided for every exercise (i.e. all tools and settings), but for many of these exercises there will be multiple solutions, so if you obtained the same results in a different way, that is correct too!
