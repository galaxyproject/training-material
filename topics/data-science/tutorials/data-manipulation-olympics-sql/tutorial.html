                <p>Scientific analyses often consist of a number of tools that run one after the other, in order to go from the raw data to scientific insight. Between these specialized tools, simple data manipulation steps are often needed as a kind of “glue” between tools. For example, the output of tool A may produce a file that contains all the information needed as input for tool B, but tool B expects the columns in a different order. Or in genomic data analysis, some tools expect chromosome X to be listed as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chrX</code>, while others simply expect <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code>. In these situations, extra data manipulation steps are needed to prepare files for input to analysis tools.</p>

<!--
Note to contributors: feel free to add sections here to include additional data manipulation options.
Make sure each section is independent of each other, i.e. each section should start with the olympics.tsv file.
Also make sure to include many exercises (with answers) for your section!
-->

<p>Galaxy has a large collection of tools to perform such basic data manipulation tasks, and becoming familiar with these operations will allow to perform your analysis more easily in Galaxy (and outside).</p>

<p>In this tutorial, these functions are explained in more detail, and we provide some exercises for you to practice.</p>

<h1 id="background">Background</h1>

<p>In this tutorial, we will use as our dataset a table with results from the Olympics, from the games in Athens in 1896 until Tokyo in 2020. The objective is to familiarize you with a large number of the most important data manipulation tools in Galaxy. Much like the Olympics, there are many different disciplines (types of operations), and for each operation there are often multiple techniques (tools) available to athletes (data analysts, you) that are great for achieving the goal.</p>

<p><a href="/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/data-manipulation-olympics/images/cover.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/data-manipulation-olympics/images/cover.jpg" alt="image of olympic rings, logo and two athletes around the words &quot;Data Analysis Olympics&quot;. " width="320" height="180" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

<p>We will show you many of these commonly needed data manipulation operations, and some examples of how to perform them in Galaxy. We also provide many exercises so that you can train your skills and become a data manipulation Olympian!</p>

<h2 id="about-this-dataset">About this dataset</h2>

<p>The data was <a href="https://github.com/UOSCS/Olympic_Athletes">obtained</a> from <a href="https://www.olympedia.org/">Olympedia</a>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">olympics</code> table contains
234,522 rows and 17 columns. Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual Olympic event. The columns are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>athlete_id</strong> - Unique number for each athlete</li>
  <li><strong>name</strong> - Athlete’s name</li>
  <li><strong>sex</strong> - M or F</li>
  <li><strong>birth_year</strong> - 4-digit number</li>
  <li><strong>birth_day</strong> - e.g. 24 July</li>
  <li><strong>birth_place</strong> - town and/or country</li>
  <li><strong>height</strong> - In centimeters (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NA</code> if data not known)</li>
  <li><strong>weight</strong> - In kilograms (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NA</code> if data not known)</li>
  <li><strong>team</strong> - Team name</li>
  <li><strong>noc</strong> - National Olympic Committee 3-letter code</li>
  <li><strong>games</strong> - Year and season</li>
  <li><strong>year</strong> - Integer</li>
  <li><strong>season</strong> - Summer or Winter</li>
  <li><strong>city</strong> - Host city</li>
  <li><strong>sport</strong> - Sport</li>
  <li><strong>event</strong> - Event</li>
  <li><strong>medal</strong> - Gold, Silver, Bronze (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NA</code> if no medal was won)</li>
</ul>

<p>We will use this dataset to practice our data manipulation skills in Galaxy.</p>

<h1 id="choose-your-adventure">Choose your adventure!</h1>

<p>This tutorial is structured a bit differently than most. <strong>You do not have to do the steps in the order they are presented below.</strong> Every section in this tutorial uses the dataset you just uploaded (the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">olympics.db</code> file) as input, so you can jump to any section in this tutorial right now if you have a particular data manipulation operation in mind you want to learn more about.</p>

<h1 id="sorting">Sorting</h1>

<p>We have a lot of data in this file, but it is ordered by the athlete ID number, which is a somewhat arbitrary and meaningless number. But we can sort the rows in this file to something more convenient, for example alphabetically by name of the athlete, or chronologically by year of the Olympics.</p>

<p>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SQL</code> we can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ORDER BY</code> clause. We’ll start by limiting our results, as every table in this dataset is quite large.</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">NOC</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">`CLDR display name`</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">countries</span> <span class="k">LIMIT</span> <span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ORDER BY column-name ASC</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ORDER BY column-name DESC</code> to sort the data ascending or descending.</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">NOC</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">`CLDR display name`</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">countries</span> <span class="k">ORDER</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">NOC</span> <span class="k">ASC</span> <span class="k">LIMIT</span> <span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">NOC</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">`CLDR display name`</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">countries</span> <span class="k">ORDER</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">NOC</span> <span class="k">DESC</span> <span class="k">LIMIT</span> <span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So let’s sort our file in chronological order, based on the year of the Olympic games:</p>

<blockquote class="question">
  <div class="box-title question-title" id="question-21"><i class="far fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Question</div>

  <ol>
    <li>Which column contains the year?</li>
  </ol>

  <blockquote class="solution">
    <div class="box-title solution-title" id="solution-20"><button class="gtn-boxify-button solution" type="button" aria-controls="solution-20" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Solution</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

    <ol>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">year</code></li>
    </ol>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">olympics</span> <span class="k">ORDER</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="nb">year</span> <span class="k">LIMIT</span> <span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we wanted to do it in reverse, we could just use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">order by year desc</code></p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">olympics</span> <span class="k">ORDER</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="nb">year</span> <span class="k">DESC</span> <span class="k">LIMIT</span> <span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote class="question">
  <div class="box-title question-title" id="question-22"><i class="far fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Question</div>

  <ol>
    <li>Write a query to access only the first entry.</li>
    <li>Which athlete is listed at the top of the file now?</li>
  </ol>

  <blockquote class="solution">
    <div class="box-title solution-title" id="solution-21"><button class="gtn-boxify-button solution" type="button" aria-controls="solution-21" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Solution</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>
    <ol>
      <li>We can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LIMIT</code> for this.
        <div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">select</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">olympics</span> <span class="k">order</span> <span class="k">by</span> <span class="nb">year</span> <span class="k">limit</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>

<p>This is great, but maybe it would make more sense to sort alphabetically by athlete name <em>within each year</em>.</p>

<h2 id="sort-on-multiple-columns-at-once">Sort on multiple columns at once</h2>

<p>So we want to sort twice, first by year, an then within each year, we sort again alphabetically by name.</p>

<p>We will sort the file in chronological order based on the year of the Olympic games</p>

<h1 id="filtering">Filtering</h1>

<p>This file contains a lot of data, but we may only be interested in a subset of this data. For example, we may only want to look at one particular Olympics, or one particular sport. In such cases we can filter the dataset. This will create a new dataset, removing any rows that are not of interest to us (i.e. that don’t meet the criteria we provide).</p>

<p>We will filter the file to show only winter Olympics
Look at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">olympics</code> table and answer the following questions</p>

<h1 id="counting">Counting</h1>

<p>A common operation we might want to perform on tables of data, is simple counting. How many times does a certain value appear? For our dataset for instance, we might want to know how many countries participated in each Olympics, how many women, etc; any column that has categorical data that we can count.</p>

<p>Let’s start by simply counting how many different Olympic Games we have in our dataset, and how many times it appears (so how many participations there were each year)</p>

<p>We’ll need to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">group by</code> syntax which takes a key, and then groups by those values.</p>

<blockquote class="question">
  <div class="box-title question-title" id="question-28"><i class="far fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Question</div>

  <ol>
    <li>How many different Olympic games are in our file?</li>
    <li>Which Olympic games had the most participations? (Tip: use order by)</li>
  </ol>

  <blockquote class="solution">
    <div class="box-title solution-title" id="solution-27"><button class="gtn-boxify-button solution" type="button" aria-controls="solution-27" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Solution</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>52 games (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">select count(*), games from olympics group by games</code>)</p>

        <p>The resulting file looks something like:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> 615	1896 Summer Olympics
 2503	1900 Summer Olympics
 2643	1904 Summer Olympics

 3448	1920 Summer Olympics
 5242	1924 Summer Olympics

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>1996 Summer Olympics. (10501 participations)</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>You may have guessed that like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">order by</code>, that we could have selected multiple columns in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">group by</code> step. This lets us count on combinations of columns.</p>

<p>Let’s try counting the number of men and women in each olympic games.</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">select</span> <span class="k">count</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">games</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sex</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">olympics</span> <span class="k">group</span> <span class="k">by</span> <span class="n">games</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sex</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote class="question">
  <div class="box-title question-title" id="question-29"><i class="far fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Question</div>

  <p>You see the resulting file has a line for every combination of the two columns (games and sex), providing the count for each.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>How many women were in the first Olympic games?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Which Olympic games had the most women participants?</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <blockquote class="solution">
    <div class="box-title solution-title" id="solution-28"><button class="gtn-boxify-button solution" type="button" aria-controls="solution-28" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Solution</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

    <ol>
      <li>2 women participated in the 1896 Olympics. (note that we cannot be sure if this is two different women, or 1 woman participating twice, in this query. Do you know any way we could query that? Try it out!)
The results looks something like this:
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2	F	1896 Summer Olympics
43	F	1900 Summer Olympics
17	F	1904 Summer Olympics

97	F	1912 Summer Olympics
132	F	1920 Summer Olympics
269	F	1924 Summer Olympics
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>2020 Summer Olympics (4652)</li>
    </ol>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s say we wanted to know how many different sports there were in each Olympics. If we used the counting query above, we would get resultsfor each combination of sport and olympics, with the number of lines (participations) of each. But we don’t really care about the number of lines that have this combination, just the total number of unique sports in each games.</p>

<p>We can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">distinct</code> filter in our pipeline to discover this. First let’s do our group by and iterate over each resulting group:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">select</span> <span class="n">games</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sport</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">olympics</span> <span class="k">group</span> <span class="k">by</span> <span class="n">games</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And let’s count all of their appearances</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">select</span> <span class="n">games</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">count</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sport</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">sports</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">olympics</span> <span class="k">group</span> <span class="k">by</span> <span class="n">games</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But those results still aren’t distinct, those numbers are far too high. So let’s use distinct:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">select</span> <span class="n">games</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">count</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">distinct</span> <span class="n">sport</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">sports</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">olympics</span> <span class="k">group</span> <span class="k">by</span> <span class="n">games</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’re almost there! Let’s sort this</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">select</span> <span class="n">games</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">count</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">distinct</span> <span class="n">sport</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">sports</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">olympics</span> <span class="k">group</span> <span class="k">by</span> <span class="n">games</span> <span class="k">order</span> <span class="k">by</span> <span class="n">sports</span> <span class="k">asc</span><span class="p">;</span>

<h1 id="grouping">Grouping</h1>

<p>Often we may want to group rows based on a value in a column, and perform some operation on the resulting rows. For example we would like to group the olympics data by one value (e.g. year, country, sport), and determine some value for each group (e.g. number of medals won, average age of athletes, etc).</p>

<p>In the <a href="#counting">counting</a> section of this tutorial we show how to get answers that require a count (e.g. number of medals won), but sometimes we want to do something more complex, like calculating the average height of athletes in a group, say per country or per sport. This section will show some example of these types of questions.</p>

<p>We can use continue to use group by for this, but now we’ll need the max and min aggregate operations. Essentially every time we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">group by</code> we need to use an aggregation like finding the maximum, minimum, or counting the number of results.</p>

<h2 id="grouping-on-multiple-columns">Grouping on multiple columns</h2>

<p>You may have noticed that we could also provide multiple columns to group on. If we do this, we can compute values for combinations of groups, such as sex and sport, to find e.g. the tallest woman in basketball or the shortest man per Olympics. There are also many more options for the computation we perform, so perhaps we are more interested not in the tallest athlete, but the average height.

<h1 id="computing">Computing</h1>

<p>Sometimes we want to use the data in our column to compute a new value, and add that to the table. For instance, for our dataset we could caluclate athtletes BMI (using height and weight columns), or their age at time of participation (from year of birth and year of the Olymics). By adding these computed values as a new colum to our datset, we can more easily query the dataset for these values. We can do these types of operations on the fly, and then if we like, store them as (temporary) tables.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s calculate the age of each athlete at the time of participation, and add this as a new column to our dataset.</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">select</span> <span class="nb">year</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">birth_year</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">age</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">games</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">olympics</span> <span class="k">LIMIT</span> <span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we want to save that result to make it easier to query, then we have a couple options.</p>

<p>This was a simple computation, but much more complex mathematical expressions can be computed with this tool. In the exercise below, we will compute the BMI for each athlete as an example.</p>

<h2 id="exercises-4">Exercises</h2>

<p>BMI stands for Body Mass Index, is a metric to provide a very crude measure of how healthy your weight is. The formula to compute BMI is:</p>

\[BMI = weight / (height^2)\]

<p>(with weight in kilograms and height in meters).</p>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolphe_Quetelet">Adolphe Quetelet</a>, who invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">BMI</a>, was not a doctor of medicine, instead he was a Belgian astronomer, mathematician, statistician, and sociologist. His data consisted probably entirely of cisgender, white, european men and women <span class="citation"><a href="#Eknoyan_2007">Eknoyan 2007</a></span>.
In his defense, he did argue it should not be used at individual levels, however it came to be used as such due to simplicity. (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index#History">Wikipedia’s History section</a>). BMI is a poor measure of health, especially for populations with high muscle content, and cannot be simply re-used as-is with anyone other than Anglo Saxons <span class="citation"><a href="#Caleyachetty_2021">Caleyachetty <i>et al.</i> 2021</a></span>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index#Limitations">Wikipedia:Limitations</a>.</p>

<h1 id="find-and-replace">Find and Replace</h1>

<p>Often you may need to change the contents of a file a bit to fit the expectations of an analysis tool. For instance, our database uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code> for missing values, but other conventions included leaving the cell empty instead. Or, when working with chromosomal data, you may need to add or remove the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chr</code> prefix from a column before using it as input to a certain tool. In such situations, we can find all occurrences of a certain pattern in our file, and replace it with another value.</p>

<p>If we want to perform such a replacement on a single column in our data, we can use an update statement.</p>

<p><!--END_SNIPPET--></p>

<p>Let’s start with a simple example:
Our file uses a mix of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Athina</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Athens</code> to indicate the Capital City of Greece in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">city</code> column.
Let’s standardize this by replacing occurrences of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Athina</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Athens</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s start by filtering out the old spelling:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">select</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">olympics</span> <span class="k">where</span> <span class="n">city</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'Athina'</span> <span class="k">limit</span> <span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s try replacing it:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">update</span> <span class="n">olympics</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="n">city</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'Athens'</span>
<span class="k">where</span> <span class="n">city</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'Athina'</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Look at the file before and after. Athlete 7 (Patrick Chila) near the top of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">olympics.tsv</code> file, had a value of Athina in the city column. Verify that it has been changed to Athens.</p>

<p>This was rather simple example, so let’s try a few more examples with slightly more complex expressions.</p>

<h2 id="exercises-5">Exercises</h2>

<p>You may have noticed that our file has a lot of missing data. Especially for the earlier years, things like height, weight and birthday of athletes was not registered, or simply not known. In some columns you see these missing values have been replaced with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NA</code> (not available) value. In other columns (for example birth place), the cells have simply been left empty.</p>

<p>Different tools may expect different ways of handling missing data. So you may have to change your missing data from empty to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NA</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NaN</code>, or something else, between analysis steps</p>

  <div class="box-title hands-on-title" id="hands-on-fill-empty-cells-1"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Hands-on: Fill empty cells</div>

  <p>We will now replace empty cells in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">birth_place</code> column, to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code> instead.</p>

    <p>other variations are possible:</p>

</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Let’s do another example, this one splitting and re-constructing strings.</p>

<p>Look at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">birth_day</code> column. It has values in a format like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">12 December</code>. Suppose we have a tool that expects this data to be in the reverse format, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">December 12</code>. We would not want to do this manually, but with sql we can make this replacement easily</p>

<p>We will now change the format in birthday column from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">day month</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">month day</code>, as our boss is American and requested the silly format.</p>

<p>First we need to understand that sqlite does not ship a regex engine, thus we cannot use familiar regular expressions. Instead we can make use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">instr(string, search)</code> to find the location of a substring like ` <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">, identifying where the day stops and the month starts. Then we can use </code>substr(string, start)<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> and </code>substr(string, start, end)` to chop up our date string.</p>

<p>In SQL, concatenation is done with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">||</code>.</p>

<h1 id="removing-columns">Removing Columns</h1>

<p>In sqlite you cannot remove columns, it is not supported. Proper databases like Postgres and MySQL support this operation.
Instead for sqlite you could select the columns you want to keep, create a new table from that, and then delete the original table.</p>

<p>Other databases:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>alter table delete column NAME from olympics

<h1 id="unique">Unique</h1>

<p>Sometimes, in the course of our data manipulations, we may end up with a file that has duplicate values. In order to filter these out, we can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">distinct</code> filter.</p>

<p>Let’s say we would like to create a list of all unique athletes (id and name).</p>

<p>First we will just select the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">athlete_id</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> columns from our dataset</p>

<h1 id="joining-datasets">Joining Datasets</h1>

<p>This database contains a lot of information, but we may want to add more information. For example if we had a file with information about each country (population, capital city, etc), we could join that information with our Olympics data, to get a single result with all information in every row.</p>

<p>For example, if we would like to be able to group by continent, to e.g. count athletes, medals etc per continent, we will have to add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">continent</code> column to our file. To do this we would need a second file that maps each country to the corresponding continent. This is what we will do in the next hands-on section.</p>

<p>We obtained country information data from <a href="https://datahub.io/core/country-codes">DataHub</a>. More information about this file can be found in the description there. It has 56 columns with a wide variety of data about each country (from country codes, to capital city, languages spoken, etc)</p>

<p>It is available in the countries table.</p>

<blockquote class="question">
  <div class="box-title question-title" id="question-37"><i class="far fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Question</div>

    </ol>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>We would now like to take our Olympics dataset as the basis, and add columns to every row of this file with some information about the country. In order to join, we will need to have one column that is shared between the two files, on which we can match. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NOC</code> column is perfect for this because it is a defined standard. Both files also contain a column with the country name in it, which is also a possible candidate to use for joining, but because it is less standardised, it is safer to use the NOC column. For example, if one file uses “Netherlands”, while the other uses “The Netherlands” to indicate the same country, the joining will fail for these rows. So always make sure the columns you join on are compatible!</p>

<p>We can use the join commands.</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">select</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">olympics</span> <span class="k">left</span> <span class="k">join</span> <span class="n">countries</span> <span class="k">on</span> <span class="n">olympics</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">noc</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">countries</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">NOC</span> <span class="k">LIMIT</span> <span class="mi">30</span>

    <ol>
      <li>All the columns from the country information file are added to the end of each row of our olympics dataset</li>
      <li>Our olympics datset had 17 columns, the country information file has 56 columns. Therefore we have 17+56=73 columns columns in our resulting file. This also means the NOC column
we joined on appears twice in our output.</li>
      <li>There is a lot of data duplication in the output now. The exact same country information is added to every line of every athlete from a certain country.
This means much larger response size.
If you do not need all these columns, it could save you a lot of space to select only specific columns that you require.</li>

<p>Concatenation of two files simple means putting the contents of the two files together, one after the other. Our dataset was created in 2021, but since then we’ve had another Olympic event, the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. If we have the same data for this latest Olympics, we could simply add the rows from the 2022 games to our current file with data, in order to create a single file with all data from 1896 to 2022.</p>

<p>View the table <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">olympics_2022</code>, does it have the same structure as our original <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">olympics</code> table?</p>

<blockquote class="question">
  <div class="box-title question-title" id="question-39"><i class="far fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Question</div>

  <ol>
    <li>Does the new table have the same structure?</li>
    <li>Can we simply add the lines of the new table to the end of our existing olympics dataset?</li>
  </ol>

  <blockquote class="solution">
    <div class="box-title solution-title" id="solution-37"><button class="gtn-boxify-button solution" type="button" aria-controls="solution-37" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Solution</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>
    <ol>
      <li>Yes, this file has all the same columns, in the same order, so concatenation should be relatively straightforward.</li>
      <li>Yes.</li>
    </ol>

<p>Since this new dataset has the exact same structure (number and order of columns), we can simple add the lines from this file to the end of our existing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">olympic</code> table.
For this, we’ll need to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">union all</code> which takes two separate sql queries and unifies the results.</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">select</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">olympics</span>
<span class="k">union</span> <span class="k">all</span>
<span class="k">select</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">olympics_2022</span>
<span class="k">LIMIT</span> <span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(Note: We are limiting the outputs to ensure your browser does not crash loading all of the data.)</p>

<p>Now this only works so simply because our two datasets had the same structure. If your data comes from different sources, you may have to do some additional data manipulation before you can union, e.g. to make sure the columns match, or how each file deals with missing data (empty cells, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NA</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NaN</code> or something else).</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>These operations covered in the tutorial are just a few examples of some of the most common operations. There are many more available. We encourage you to look around the documentation of sqlite or your database. The more comfortable you are performing these kinds of steps, the more you can get out of SQL!</p>

<h1 id="exercises-putting-it-all-together">Exercises: Putting it all together!</h1>

<p>This section provides a number of exercises that require you to combine two or more of the techniques you learned in this tutorial. This is a great way to practice your data manipulation skills. Full solutions are provided for every exercise (i.e. all tools and settings), but for many of these exercises there will be multiple solutions, so if you obtained the same results in a different way, that is correct too!</p>

  <p>If you have done exercises in the <a href="#sorting">sorting</a> section, you noticed that finding the shortest athlete ever to compete was not easy,
because all the rows with missing height data (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NA</code>) in the column were sorted to the top. We need to filter out these values first, then
perform our sort, so that our answer is on top.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Find the shortest athlete ever to compete in the Olympics</li>
