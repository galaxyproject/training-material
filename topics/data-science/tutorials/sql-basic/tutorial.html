<h1 id="selecting-data">Selecting Data</h1>

<p>A relational database
is a way to store and manipulate information.
Databases are arranged as table.
Each table has columns (also known as fields) that describe the data,
and rows (also known as records) which contain the data.</p>

<p>When we are using a spreadsheet,
we put formulas into cells to calculate new values based on old ones.
When we are using a database,
we send commands
(usually called queries)
to a database manager:
a program that manipulates the database for us.
The database manager does whatever lookups and calculations the query specifies,
returning the results in a tabular form
that we can then use as a starting point for further queries.</p>

<p>Queries are written in a language called <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr>,
SQL provides hundreds of different ways to analyze and recombine data.
We will only look at a handful of queries,
but that handful accounts for most of what scientists do.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <div class="box-title tip-title" id="tip-changing-database-managers-1"><button class="gtn-boxify-button tip" type="button" aria-controls="tip-changing-database-managers-1" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Tip: Changing Database Managers</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p>Many database managers — Oracle,
IBM DB2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft Access, and SQLite —  understand
SQL but each stores data in a different way,
so a database created with one cannot be used directly by another.
However, every database manager
can import and export data in a variety of formats like .csv, SQL,
so it <em>is</em> possible to move information from one to another.</p>

<p>Notice that three entries — one in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Visited</code> table,
and two in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Survey</code> table — don’t contain any actual
data, but instead have a special <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">None</code> entry:
we’ll return to these missing values.</p>

<p>For now,
let’s write an SQL query that displays scientists’ names.
We do this using the SQL command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SELECT</code>,
giving it the names of the columns we want and the table we want them from.
Our query and its output look like this:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">family</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">personal</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Person</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The semicolon at the end of the query
tells the database manager that the query is complete and ready to run.
We have written our commands in upper case and the names for the table and columns
in lower case,
but we don’t have to:
as the example below shows,
SQL is case insensitive.</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SeLeCt</span> <span class="n">FaMiLy</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">PeRsOnAl</span> <span class="k">FrOm</span> <span class="n">PeRsOn</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can use SQL’s case insensitivity to your advantage. For instance,
some people choose to write SQL keywords (such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SELECT</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FROM</code>)
in capital letters and <strong>field</strong> and <strong>table</strong> names in lower
case. This can make it easier to locate parts of an SQL statement. For
instance, you can scan the statement, quickly locate the prominent
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FROM</code> keyword and know the table name follows.  Whatever casing
convention you choose, please be consistent: complex queries are hard
enough to read without the extra cognitive load of random
capitalization.  One convention is to use UPPER CASE for SQL
statements, to distinguish them from tables and column names. This is
the convention that we will use for this lesson.</p>

    <p>No, it is generally not. There are a lot of <a href="https://shinesolutions.com/2018/01/08/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names-with-examples/">falsehoods that programmers believe about names</a>.
The situation is much more complex as you can read in that article, but names vary wildly and
generally placing constraints on how names are entered is only likely to frustrate you or your
users later on when they need to enter data into that database.</p>

    <p>In general you should consider using a single text field for the name and allowing users to
specify them as whatever they like (if it is a system with registration), or asking what they
wish to be recorded (if you are doing this sort of data collection).</p>

    <p>If you are doing scientific research, you might know that names are generally very poor
identifiers of a single human, and in that case consider recording their
<a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCiD</a> which will help you reference that individual when you are
publishing later.</p>

    <p>This is also a good time to consider what data you really <em>need</em> to collect. If you are working
in the EU under GDPR, do you really need their full legal name? Is that necessary? Do you have a
plan for ensuring that data is correct when publishing, if any part of their name has changed
since?</p>

<p>While we are on the topic of SQL’s syntax, one aspect of SQL’s syntax
that can frustrate novices and experts alike is forgetting to finish a
command with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">;</code> (semicolon).  When you press enter for a command
without adding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">;</code> to the end, it can look something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT id FROM Person
...&gt;
...&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is SQL’s prompt, where it is waiting for additional commands or
for a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">;</code> to let SQL know to finish.  This is easy to fix!  Just type
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">;</code> and press enter!</p>

<p>Now, going back to our query,
it’s important to understand that
the rows and columns in a database table aren’t actually stored in any particular order.
They will always be <em>displayed</em> in some order,
but we can control that in various ways.
For example,
we could swap the columns in the output by writing our query as:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">personal</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">family</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Person</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or even repeat columns:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">id</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Person</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As a shortcut,
we can select all of the columns in a table using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code>:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Person</span><span class="p">;</span>

<h1 id="sorting-and-removing-duplicates">Sorting and Removing Duplicates</h1>

<p>In beginning our examination of the Antarctic data, we want to know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what kind of quantity measurements were taken at each site;</li>
  <li>which scientists took measurements on the expedition;</li>
</ul>

<p>To determine which measurements were taken at each site,
we can examine the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Survey</code> table.
Data is often redundant,
so queries often return redundant information.
For example,
if we select the quantities that have been measured
from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Survey</code> table,
we get this:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">quant</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Survey</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This result makes it difficult to see all of the different types of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">quant</code> in the Survey table.  We can eliminate the redundant output to
make the result more readable by adding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DISTINCT</code> keyword to our
query:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="k">DISTINCT</span> <span class="n">quant</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Survey</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we want to determine which visit (stored in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">taken</code> column)
have which <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">quant</code> measurement,
we can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DISTINCT</code> keyword on multiple columns.
If we select more than one column,
distinct <em>sets</em> of values are returned
(in this case <em>pairs</em>, because we are selecting two columns):</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="k">DISTINCT</span> <span class="n">taken</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">quant</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Survey</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice in both cases that duplicates are removed
even if the rows they come from didn’t appear to be adjacent in the database table.</p>

<p>Our next task is to identify the scientists on the expedition by looking at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person</code> table.
As we mentioned earlier,
database records are not stored in any particular order.
This means that query results aren’t necessarily sorted,
and even if they are,
we often want to sort them in a different way,
e.g., by their identifier instead of by their personal name.
We can do this in SQL by adding an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ORDER BY</code> clause to our query:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Person</span> <span class="k">ORDER</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>id</th>
      <th>personal</th>
      <th>family</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>danfort</td>
      <td>Frank</td>
      <td>Danforth</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>dyer</td>
      <td>William</td>
      <td>Dyer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>lake</td>
      <td>Anderson</td>
      <td>Lake</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>pb</td>
      <td>Frank</td>
      <td>Pabodie</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>roe</td>
      <td>Valentina</td>
      <td>Roerich</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>By default, when we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ORDER BY</code>,
results are sorted in ascending order of the column we specify
(i.e.,
from least to greatest).</p>

<p>We can sort in the opposite order using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DESC</code> (for “descending”):</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <div class="box-title tip-title" id="tip-a-note-on-ordering-1"><button class="gtn-boxify-button tip" type="button" aria-controls="tip-a-note-on-ordering-1" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Tip: A note on ordering</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p>While it may look that the records are consistent every time we ask for them in this lesson, that is because no one has changed or modified any of the data so far. Remember to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ORDER BY</code> if you want the rows returned to have any sort of consistent or predictable order.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">person</span> <span class="k">ORDER</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">id</span> <span class="k">DESC</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(And if we want to make it clear that we’re sorting in ascending order,
we can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ASC</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DESC</code>.)</p>

<p>In order to look at which scientist measured quantities during each visit,
we can look again at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Survey</code> table.
We can also sort on several fields at once.
For example,
this query sorts results first in ascending order by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">taken</code>,
and then in descending order by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">person</code>
within each group of equal <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">taken</code> values:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">taken</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">person</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">quant</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Survey</span> <span class="k">ORDER</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">taken</span> <span class="k">ASC</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">person</span> <span class="k">DESC</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This query gives us a good idea of which scientist was involved in which visit,
and what measurements they performed during the visit.</p>

<p>Looking at the table, it seems like some scientists specialized in
certain kinds of measurements.  We can examine which scientists
performed which measurements by selecting the appropriate columns and
removing duplicates.</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="k">DISTINCT</span> <span class="n">quant</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">person</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Survey</span> <span class="k">ORDER</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">quant</span> <span class="k">ASC</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <p>If you are someone with a name which falls at the end of the alphabet, you’ve likely been
penalised for this your entire life. Alphabetically sorting names should always be looked at
critically and through a lens to whether you are fairly reflecting everyone’s contributions,
rather than just the default sort order.</p>

  <p>There are many options, either by some metric of contribution that everyone could agree on, or
better, consider random sorting, like the GTN uses with our <a href="/training-material/hall-of-fame.html">Hall of Fame</a>
page where we intentionally order randomly to tell contributors that no one persons
contributions matter more than anothers.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">
    <p>The evidence provided in a variety of studies leaves no doubt that an
alphabetical author ordering norm disadvantages researchers with
last names toward the end of the alphabet. There is furthermore con-
vincing evidence that researchers are aware of this and that they
react strategically to such alphabetical discrimination, for example
with their choices of who to collaborate with. See <span class="citation"><a href="#Weber_2018">Weber 2018</a></span> for more.</p>

  <p>When you are sorting things in SQL, you need to be aware of something called collation which can
affect your results if you have values that are not the letters A-Z. Collating is the process of
sorting values, and this affects many human languages when storing data in a database.</p>

  <p>Here is a Dutch example. In the old days their alphabet contained a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ÿ</code> which was later replaced
with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ĳ</code>, a digraph of two characters squished together. This is commonly rendered as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ij</code>
however, two separate characters, due to the internet and widespread use of keyboards featuring
mainly ascii characters. However, it is still the 25th letter of their alphabet.</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sqlite&gt; create table nl(value text);
sqlite&gt; insert into nl values ('appel'), ('beer'), ('index'), ('ijs'), ('jammer'), ('winkel'), ('zon');
sqlite&gt; select * from nl order by value;
appel
beer
index
ijs
jammer
winkel
zon
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>Find a dutch friend and ask them if this is the correct order for this list. Unfortunately it
isn’t. Even though it is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ij</code> as two separate characters, it should be sorted as if it was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ĳ</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ÿ</code>, before <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z</code>. Like so: appel, beer, index, jammer, winkel, ijs, zon</p>

  <p>While there is not much you can do about it now (you’re just beginning!) it is something you
should be aware of. When you later need to know about this, you will find the term ‘collation’
useful, and you’ll find the procedure is different for every database engine.</p>

<h1 id="filtering">Filtering</h1>

<p>One of the most powerful features of a database is
the ability to filter data,
i.e.,
to select only those records that match certain criteria.
For example,
suppose we want to see when a particular site was visited.
We can select these records from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Visited</code> table
by using a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WHERE</code> clause in our query:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Visited</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">site</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'DR-1'</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The database manager executes this query in two stages.
First,
it checks at each row in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Visited</code> table
to see which ones satisfy the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WHERE</code>.
It then uses the column names following the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SELECT</code> keyword
to determine which columns to display.</p>

<p>This processing order means that
we can filter records using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WHERE</code>
based on values in columns that aren’t then displayed:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">id</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Visited</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">site</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'DR-1'</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>![SQL Filtering in Action]`(../../images/carpentries-sql/sql-filter.svg)</p>

<p>We can use many other Boolean operators to filter our data.
For example,
we can ask for all information from the DR-1 site collected before 1930:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Visited</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">site</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'DR-1'</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="n">dated</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="s1">'1930-01-01'</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

  <p>Most database managers have a special data type for dates.
In fact, many have two:
one for dates,
such as “May 31, 1971”,
and one for durations,
such as “31 days”.
SQLite doesn’t:
instead,
it stores dates as either text
(in the ISO-8601 standard format “YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSSS”),
real numbers
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day">Julian days</a>, the number of days since November 24, 4714 BCE),
or integers
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time</a>, the number of seconds since midnight, January 1, 1970).
If this sounds complicated,
it is,
but not nearly as complicated as figuring out
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_calendar">historical dates in Sweden</a>.</p>

<p>If we want to find out what measurements were taken by either Lake or Roerich,
we can combine the tests on their names using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OR</code>:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Survey</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'lake'</span> <span class="k">OR</span> <span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'roe'</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alternatively,
we can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IN</code> to see if a value is in a specific set:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Survey</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">person</span> <span class="k">IN</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'lake'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'roe'</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can combine <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AND</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OR</code>,
but we need to be careful about which operator is executed first.
If we <em>don’t</em> use parentheses,
we get this:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Survey</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">quant</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'sal'</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'lake'</span> <span class="k">OR</span> <span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'roe'</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which is salinity measurements by Lake,
and <em>any</em> measurement by Roerich.
We probably want this instead:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Survey</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">quant</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'sal'</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'lake'</span> <span class="k">OR</span> <span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'roe'</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can also filter by partial matches.  For example, if we want to
know something just about the site names beginning with “DR” we can
use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LIKE</code> keyword.  The percent symbol acts as a
wildcard, matching any characters in that
place.  It can be used at the beginning, middle, or end of the string
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_wildcards.asp">See this page on wildcards</a> for more information:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Visited</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">site</span> <span class="k">LIKE</span> <span class="s1">'DR%'</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally,
we can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DISTINCT</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WHERE</code>
to give a second level of filtering:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="k">DISTINCT</span> <span class="n">person</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">quant</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Survey</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'lake'</span> <span class="k">OR</span> <span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'roe'</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But remember:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DISTINCT</code> is applied to the values displayed in the chosen columns,
not to the entire rows as they are being processed.</p>

  <p>What we have just done is how most people “grow” their <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> queries.
We started with something simple that did part of what we wanted,
then added more clauses one by one,
testing their effects as we went.
This is a good strategy — in fact,
for complex queries it’s often the <em>only</em> strategy — but
it depends on quick turnaround,
and on us recognizing the right answer when we get it.</p>

  <p>The best way to achieve quick turnaround is often
to put a subset of data in a temporary database
and run our queries against that,
or to fill a small database with synthesized records.
For example,
instead of trying our queries against an actual database of 20 million Australians,
we could run it against a sample of ten thousand,
or write a small program to generate ten thousand random (but plausible) records
and use that.</p>

<h1 id="calculating-new-values">Calculating New Values</h1>

<p>After carefully re-reading the expedition logs,
we realize that the radiation measurements they report
may need to be corrected upward by 5%.
Rather than modifying the stored data,
we can do this calculation on the fly
as part of our query:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">05</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">reading</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Survey</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">quant</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'rad'</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When we run the query,
the expression <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.05 * reading</code> is evaluated for each row.
Expressions can use any of the fields,
all of usual arithmetic operators,
and a variety of common functions.
(Exactly which ones depends on which database manager is being used.)
For example,
we can convert temperature readings from Fahrenheit to Celsius
and round to two decimal places:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">taken</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">round</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">reading</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">32</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Survey</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">quant</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'temp'</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see from this example, though, the string describing our
new field (generated from the equation) can become quite unwieldy. <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr>
allows us to rename our fields, any field for that matter, whether it
was calculated or one of the existing fields in our database, for
succinctness and clarity. For example, we could write the previous
query as:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">taken</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">round</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">reading</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">32</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">Celsius</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Survey</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">quant</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'temp'</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can also combine values from different fields,
for example by using the string concatenation operator <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">||</code>:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">personal</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="s1">' '</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="n">family</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Person</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But of course that can also be solved by simply having a single name field which avoids other
issues.</p>

  <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UNION ALL</code> command is equivalent to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UNION</code> operator,
except that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UNION ALL</code> will select all values.
The difference is that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UNION ALL</code> will not eliminate duplicate rows.
Instead, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UNION ALL</code> pulls all rows from the query
specifics and combines them into a table.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UNION</code> command does a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SELECT DISTINCT</code> on the results set.
If all the records to be returned are unique from your union,
use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UNION ALL</code> instead, it gives faster results since it skips the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DISTINCT</code> step.
For this section, we shall use UNION.</p>

  <p>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UNION</code> to create a consolidated list of salinity measurements
in which Valentina Roerich’s, and only Valentina’s,
have been corrected as described in the previous challenge.

<h1 id="missing-data">Missing Data</h1>

<p>Real-world data is never complete — there are always holes.
Databases represent these holes using a special value called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code>.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code> is not zero, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">False</code>, or the empty string;
it is a one-of-a-kind value that means “nothing here”.
Dealing with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code> requires a few special tricks
and some careful thinking.</p>

<p>By default, the Python SQL interface does not display NULL values in its output, instead it shows <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">None</code>.</p>

<p>To start,
let’s have a look at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Visited</code> table.
There are eight records,
but #752 doesn’t have a date — or rather,
its date is null:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Visited</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Null doesn’t behave like other values.
If we select the records that come before 1930:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Visited</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">dated</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="s1">'1930-01-01'</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>we get two results,
and if we select the ones that come during or after 1930:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Visited</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">dated</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="s1">'1930-01-01'</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>we get five,
but record #752 isn’t in either set of results.
The reason is that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null&lt;'1930-01-01'</code>
is neither true nor false:
null means, “We don’t know,”
and if we don’t know the value on the left side of a comparison,
we don’t know whether the comparison is true or false.
Since databases represent “don’t know” as null,
the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null&lt;'1930-01-01'</code>
is actually <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code>.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null&gt;='1930-01-01'</code> is also null
because we can’t answer to that question either.
And since the only records kept by a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WHERE</code>
are those for which the test is true,
record #752 isn’t included in either set of results.</p>

<p>Comparisons aren’t the only operations that behave this way with nulls.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1+null</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5*null</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log(null)</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code>,
and so on.
In particular,
comparing things to null with = and != produces null:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Visited</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">dated</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">NULL</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>produces no output, and neither does:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Visited</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">dated</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="k">NULL</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To check whether a value is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code> or not,
we must use a special test <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IS NULL</code>:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Visited</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">dated</span> <span class="k">IS</span> <span class="k">NULL</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or its inverse <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IS NOT NULL</code>:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Visited</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">dated</span> <span class="k">IS</span> <span class="k">NOT</span> <span class="k">NULL</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Null values can cause headaches wherever they appear.
For example,
suppose we want to find all the salinity measurements
that weren’t taken by Lake.
It’s natural to write the query like this:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Survey</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">quant</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'sal'</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="s1">'lake'</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>but this query filters omits the records
where we don’t know who took the measurement.
Once again,
the reason is that when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">person</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code>,
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!=</code> comparison produces <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code>,
so the record isn’t kept in our results.
If we want to keep these records
we need to add an explicit check:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">Survey</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">quant</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'sal'</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="s1">'lake'</span> <span class="k">OR</span> <span class="n">person</span> <span class="k">IS</span> <span class="k">NULL</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We still have to decide whether this is the right thing to do or not.
If we want to be absolutely sure that
we aren’t including any measurements by Lake in our results,
we need to exclude all the records for which we don’t know who did the work.</p>

<p>In contrast to arithmetic or Boolean operators, aggregation functions
that combine multiple values, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">min</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">max</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">avg</code>, <em>ignore</em>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code> values. In the majority of cases, this is a desirable output:
for example, unknown values are thus not affecting our data when we
are averaging it. Aggregation functions will be addressed in more
detail in <a href="#">the next section</a>.</p>

  <p>What do you expect the following query to produce?</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT * FROM Visited WHERE dated IN ('1927-02-08', NULL);

    <p>You might expect the above query to return rows where dated is either ‘1927-02-08’ or NULL.
Instead it only returns rows where dated is ‘1927-02-08’, the same as you would get from this
simpler query:</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT * FROM Visited WHERE dated IN ('1927-02-08');
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>The reason is that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IN</code> operator works with a set of <em>values</em>, but NULL is by definition
not a value and is therefore simply ignored.</p>

    <p>If we wanted to actually include NULL, we would have to rewrite the query to use the IS NULL condition:</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT * FROM Visited WHERE dated = '1927-02-08' OR dated IS NULL;
</code></pre></div>    </div>

  <p>Some database designers prefer to use
a sentinel value
to mark missing data rather than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code>.
For example,
they will use the date “0000-00-00” to mark a missing date,
or -1.0 to mark a missing salinity or radiation reading
(since actual readings cannot be negative).
What does this simplify?
What burdens or risks does it introduce?</p>
