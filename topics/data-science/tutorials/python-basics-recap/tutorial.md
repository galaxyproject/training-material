# Review

This recapitulates the main points from all of the previous modular tutorials

## Math

Math in python works a lot like math in real life (from algebra onwards). Variables can be assigned, and worked with in the place of numbers

```python
x = 1
y = 2
z = x * y
```

We can use familiar math operators:

Operator | Operation
--- | ---
`+` | Addition
`-` | Subtraction
`*` | Multiplication
`/` | Division (`//` for rounded, integer division)

And some familiar operations require the use of the `math` module:

```python
import math
print(math.pow(2, 8))
print(math.sqrt(9))
```

## Functions

Functions were similarly analogous to algebra and mathematics, we can express `f(x) = x * 3` in python as:

```python
def f(x, y=3):
    z = y * 2
    return x * z
```

There are a few basic parts of a function:

- `def` starts a function *definition*
- it needs a name, here it's `f`
- between some parentheses are the arguments
    - the are arguments, just the variable name (`x`)
    - and keyword arguments, where there is a variable and a value (`y=3`)
- The function body
    - With one or more lines
    - Usually ending in a `return`

And we know we can nest functions, using functional composition, just like in math. In math functional composition was written `f(g(x))` and in python it's exactly the same:

```python
print(math.sqrt(math.pow(2, 4)))
```

Here we've nested three different functions (print is a function!). To read this we start in the middle (math.pow) and move outwards (math.sqrt, print).

## Types

There are lots of different datatypes in Python! The basic types are `bool`, `int`, `float`, `str`. Then we have more complex datatypes like `list` and `dict` which can contain the basic types (as well as other lists/dicts nested.)

Data type       | Examples                  | When to use it | When **not** to use it
---             | ---                       | ---- | ----
Boolean (`bool`) | `True`, `False` | If there are only two possible states, true or false | If your data is not binary
Integer (`int`) | 1, 0, -1023, 42           | Countable, singular items. How many patients are there, how many events did you record, how many variants are there in the sequence | If doubling or halving the value would not make sense: do not use for e.g. patient IDs, or phone numbers. If these are integers you might accidentally do math on the value.
Float (`float`) | 123.49, 3.14159, -3.33334 | If you need more precision or partial values. Recording distance between places, height, mass, etc.
Strings (`str`) | 'patient_12312', 'Jane Doe', '火锅' | To store free text, identifiers, sequence IDs, etc. | If it's truly a numeric value you can do calculations with, like adding or subtracting or doing statistics.
List / Array (`list`) | `['A', 1, 3.4, ['Nested']]` | If you need to store a list of items, like sequences from a file. Especially if you're reading in a table of data from a file. | If you want to retrieve individual values, and there are clear identifiers it might be better as a dict.
Dictionary / Associative Array / map (`dict`) | `{"weight": 3.4, "age": 12, "name": "Fluffy"}` | When you have identifiers for your data, and want to look them up by that value. E.g. looking up sequences by an identifier, or data about students based on their name. Counting values. | If you just have a list of items without identifiers, it makes more sense to just use a list.

There are a couple more datatypes we didn't cover in detail: `set`s, `tuple`, `None`, `enum`, `byte`, all of which [can be read about in Python's documentation.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datatypes.html)

## Comparators

We have a couple of comparators available to use specifically for numeric values:

- `>`: greater than
- `<`: less than
- `>=`: greater than or equal to
- `<=`: less than or equal to

And a couple that can be used with numbers and strings (or other values!)

- `==`: equal to
- `!=`: does not equal

## Iterables

In Python, there is a class of things which can be easily looped over, called "iterables". All of the following are examples of iterable items:

- `range(10)`
- `'abcd'`, a string
- `['a', 'b' , 'c' , 'd']`, a list

## Flow Control

Basic flow control looks like `if`, `elif`, `else`:

```python
blood_oxygen_saturation = 92.3
altitude = 0

if blood_oxygen_saturation > 96 and altitude == 0:
    print("Healthy individual at sea level")
elif blood_oxygen_saturation > 92 and altitude >= 1000:
    print("Healthy value above sea level")
elif blood_oxygen_saturation == 0:
    print("Monitor failure")
else:
    print("Not good")
```

We must start with an `if`, then we can have one or more `elif`s, and 0 or 1 else to end our clause. If there is no `else`, it's like nothing happens, we just check the `if` and `elif`s and if none match, nothing happens by default.

We could use `and` to check if both conditions are true, and `or` to check if one condition is true.

```python
# And
for i in (True, False):
    for j in (True, False):
        print(f"{i} AND {j} => {i and j}")
# Or
for i in (True, False):
    for j in (True, False):
        print(f"{i} OR {j} => {i or j}")
```

And if we needed, we can invert conditions with not.

```python
# Not
for i in (True, False):
    print(f"NOT {i} => {not i}")
```

All of these components (`if/elif/else`, `and`, `or`, `not`, numerical and value comparators) let us build up

## Loops

Loops let us *loop* over the contents of something iterable (a string, a list, lines in a file). We write

```
for loopVariable in myIterable:
    # Do something
    print(loopVariable)
```

Each loop has:

- `for`, a keyword to start the loop
- a loop variable, here named `loopVariable` which is set automatically every iteration of the loop
- `in`, a keyword used in a loop
- something we want to iterate over like a list or string (which is really just a list of single characters) or lines in a file.
- a loop body where all the action happens

```python
a = 0
c = 0
t = 0
g = 0

for base in 'ACTGATGCYGGCA':
    if base == 'A':
        a = a + 1
    elif base == 'C':
        c = c + 1
    elif base == 'T':
        t = t + 1
    elif base == 'G':
        g = g + 1
    else:
        print("Unexpected base!")

print(f"a={a} c={c} t={t} g={g}")
```

## Files

In python you must `open()` a file handle, using one of the three modes (read, write, or append). Normally you must also later `close()` that file, but your life can be a bit

```python
with open('out.txt', 'w') as handle:
    handle.write("Здравствуйте ")
    handle.write("世界!\n")
    handle.write("Welcome!\n")

# Can no longer handle.write(), once we've exited the with block, the file is automatically closed for us.
```

There are several basic parts

- We use `with` to indicate we want to use the context manager for file opening (this is what automatically closes the file afterwards)
- `open(path, mode)` opens a file
- `as` is a keyword
- `handle` is the name of a file handle, something that represents the file which we can write to, or read from.

Additionally if you need a newline in your file, you *must* write it yourself with a `\n`.

The above code is equivalent to this, but it is not recommended, it's a bit harder to read, and it is very very common to forget to close files which is not ideal.

```python
handle = open('out.txt', 'w')
handle.write("Здравствуйте ")
handle.write("世界!\n")
handle.write("Welcome!\n")
handle.close()

# Can no longer write.
```

You can also read from a file:

```python
# Read the entire file as one giant string
with open('out.txt', 'r') as handle:
    print(handle.read())

# Or read it as separate lines.
with open('out.txt', 'r') as handle:
    print(handle.readlines())
```

## Exceptions

Sometimes things go wrong!

- You divide by zero (`ZeroDivisionError`)
- You try and add a string and a number (`TypeError`)
- You have incorrect indentation (`IndentationError`)
- Files are unreadable
- Files have the wrong permissions

If you expect that something will go wrong you can guard against it with a `try`/`except`

```python
try:
    print(1 / 0)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Nope! I expected that!")
```

Some of the most common reasons to do this are when you're processing user input data. Users often input invalid data, unfortunately.

# Exercises

## Series Approximation

Write a program that computes the sum of an alternating series where each element of the series is an expression of the form

$$4\cdot\sum_{k=1}^{N} \dfrac{(-1)^{k+1}}{2 * k-1}$$

Use that expression and calculate the sum for various values of N like `10`, `1000`, `1000000`

```python
# Write your approximation here!
def calculate_sum(N):
    # for values in the range [1, N] (inclusive!)
        # calculate the expression (the bit after the Sigma)
    # sum up all of those numbers!
    return value

print(calculate_sum(10))
```

## Monte Carlo Simulation

You can use a monte carlo simulation to calculate the value of π. The easy way to do this is to take the region `x = [0, 1], y = [0, 1]`, and fill it with random points. For each point, calculate the distance to the origin. Calculate the ratio of the inside points to the total points, and multiply the value by 4 to estimate π.

You can use the `random` module to generate random values:

```python
import random

print(random.random())
print(random.random())
print(random.random())
```

Using the `random.random()` to generate x and y coordinates, write a function that:

- generates N random points
- calculate their distance to the origin
- Calculate the number of points that are `distance<=1`
- divide that by `N`, and multiply by `4`.

![Gif of the unit square 0, 1 on the x and y axes. Points are being randomly generated and points inside the unit circle are marked in red, outside in blue. A quarter of a circle starts to appear, and the numbers at the top show as N increases, the approximation of Pi improves.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Pi_30K.gif "Gif from the Wikipedia Article for Monte Carlo Method")

```python
# Write your code here!
import math

# Just a suggestion: write a function to calculate the distance to origin.
#
def distance(x, y):
    # ...
    return

def generate_random_point():
    # ....
    return [x, y]

def approximate(N=1000):
    # For every point in the range [0, N]
    #   check if it's distance is great than 1

    # Find the ratio of how many are distance<=1
    # and return 4 times that ratio.
    return 4 * x

# Try it with a couple N values like 1, 100, 100000,
n = 10000
# Since we're using a random number function, the result is different every
# time we run the simulation.
print(approximate(n))
print(approximate(n))
print(approximate(n))
```

## Sixpack

Sixpack is an old EMBOSS program which takes in a DNA sequence, and then for every frame, for both strands, emits every {ORF} that it sees.

```
  G  R  G  F  W  C  L  G  G  K  A  A  K  N  Y  R  E  K  S  V  D  V  A  G  Y  D  X   F1

    P  T  A  E  P  A  Q  A  T  F  R  C  F  V  V  T  F  L  R  H  I  H  R  T  I  I    F4
```

Here we see a DNA sequence `GGGCGTGGCTTCTGGTGCCTGGGCGGTAAAGCGGCAAAAAACTACCGTGAAAAGTCGGTGGATGTGGCGGGTTATGATG` which you'll use as input. Above is the translation of the sequence to protein, for each of the three frames (F1-6). Below is the reverse complement of the sequence, and the three frame translation again.

What sixpack does is:

```
orfs = []

for sequence in [forward, reverse_complement(forward)]:
    for frame in [sequence, sequence[1:], sequence[2:]]:
        # Remembering
        for potential start_codon:
            # accumulate until it sees a stop codon
            # and append it to the orfs array once it does.
```

Here are some variables for your convenience:

```python
start_codons = ['TTG', 'CTG', 'ATG']
stop_codons = ['TAA', 'TAG', 'TGA']

# And some convenience functions
def is_start_codon(codon):
    return codon in start_codons

def is_stop_codon(codon):
    return codon in stop_codons
```

It's a good exercise to rewrite `sixpack` in a very simplified version without most of the features in sixpack:

```python
# Write your code here!

# Some recommendations:
def reverse_complement(sequence):
    return ...

orfs = []

for sequence in [forward, reverse_complement(forward)]:
    for frame in [sequence, sequence[1:], sequence[2:]]:
        # Remembering
        for potential start_codon:
            # accumulate until it sees a stop codon
            # and append it to the orfs array once it does.
```
