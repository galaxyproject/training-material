It is covered with S-protein projections giving it an appearance of solar corona - hence the term coronavirus. Inside the envelope is a nucleocapsid that has helical symmetry far more typical of (-)-strand RNA viruses. There are four main structure proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N; Fig. below <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0065-3527(06)66005-3\">Masters:2006</a>):</p>\n<figure id=\"figure-3\" style=\"max-width: 90%;\"><img src=\"https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0065352706660053-gr1.jpg\" alt=\"Virion structure. \" loading=\"lazy\" /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0065352706660053-gr1.jpg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class=\"figcaption-prefix\"><strong>Figure 3</strong>:</span> Schematic of the coronavirus virion, with the minimal set of structural proteins</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Mature S protein is a trimer of two subunits: S1 and S2. The two subunits are produced from a single S-precursor by host proteases (see <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature17200\">Kirchdoerfer:2016</a>; this however is not the case for all coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV).

In the case of SARS-CoV-2 (as is in SARS-CoV) angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as the receptor binding to C-terminal portion of S1 domain. After receptor binding S protein is cleaved at two sites within the S2 subdomain. The first cleavage separates the receptor-binding domain of S from the membrane fusion domain. The second cleavage (at S2’) exposes the fusion peptide. The SARS-CoV-2 is different from SARS-CoV in that it contains a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furin\">furin</a> cleavage site that is processed during viral maturation within endoplasmatic reticulum (ER; see <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058\">Walls:2020</a>). The fusion peptide inserts into the cellular membrane and triggers joining on the two heptad regions with S2 forming an antiparallel six-helix bundle resulting in fusion and release of the genome into the cytoplasm (Fig. below from <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41580-021-00418-x\">Jackson:2022</a>.</p>\n<figure id=\"figure-4\" style=\"max-width: 90%;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DD7EO3G.png\" alt=\"Entering the cell. \" loading=\"lazy\" /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/DD7EO3G.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class=\"figcaption-prefix\"><strong>Figure 4</strong>:</span> Two spike (S) protein cleavage events are typically necessary for the coronavirus entry process: one at the junction of the S1 and S2 subunits and the other at the S2′ site, internal to the S2 subunit. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the polybasic sequence at the S1–S2 boundary is cleaved during virus maturation in an infected cell, but the S2′ site is cleaved at the target cell following angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding. Virus binding to ACE2 (step 1) induces conformational changes in the S1 subunit and exposes the S2′ cleavage site in the S2 subunit. Depending on the entry route taken by SARS-CoV-2, the S2′ site is cleaved by different proteases. Left: If the target cell expresses insufficient transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) or if a virus–ACE2 complex does not encounter TMPRSS2, the virus–ACE2 complex is internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (step 2) into the endolysosomes, where S2′ cleavage is performed by cathepsins, which require an acidic environment for their activity (steps 3 and 4). Right: In the presence of TMPRSS2, S2′ cleavage occurs at the cell surface (step 2). In both entry pathways, cleavage of the S2′ site exposes the fusion peptide (FP) and dissociation of S1 from S2 induces dramatic conformational changes in the S2 subunit, especially in heptad repeat 1, propelling the fusion peptide forward into the target membrane, initiating membrane fusion (step 5 on the left and step 3 on the right). Fusion between viral and cellular membranes forms a fusion pore through which viral RNA is released into the host cell cytoplasm for uncoating and replication (step 6 on the left and step 4 on the right). Several agents disrupt interaction between the S protein and ACE2: ACE2 mimetics, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies targeting the neutralizing epitopes on the S protein and antibodies elicited by vaccination block virus binding to ACE2 and thus inhibit both entry pathways. By contrast, strategies targeting post-receptor-binding steps differ between the two pathways. Being a serine protease inhibitor, camostat mesylate restricts the TMPRSS2-mediated entry pathway. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine block endosomal acidification, which is necessary for cathepsin activity, and thus restrict the cathepsin-mediated entry pathway</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"replication\">Replication</h2>\n<p>The above figure shows that in addition to the full length (+)-strand genome there is a number of (+)-strand subgenomic RNAs corresponding to 3’-end of the complete viral sequence. All of these <em>subgenomic</em> RNAs (sgRNAs) share the same leader sequence that is present only once at the extreme 5’-end of the viral genome. These RNAs are produced via discontinuous RNA synthesis when the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) switches template:</p>\n<iframe title=\"vimeo-player\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/133088346\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n<p>☝ Model for the formation of genome high-order structures regulating N gene transcription.

The method allows you to perform calculations or operations on existing columns to generate new columns without modifying the original DataFrame.</p>\n<p>For example, you can use the <code style=\"color: inherit\">assign</code> method to add a new column that calculates the sum of two existing columns or to add a column based on a complex calculation that involves multiple columns. The method also supports adding columns based on external data sources, such as NumPy arrays or other pandas DataFrames.</p>\n<p>Using <code style=\"color: inherit\">assign</code> method is useful because it allows you to create new columns and add them to a DataFrame in a way that is both readable and easy to maintain. The method is also chain-able, meaning you can add multiple columns in one call, making your code more concise and efficient.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-note-about-vectorization\">A note about vectorization</h2>\n<p>Notice how applying the <code style=\"color: inherit\">&lt;=</code> operator to a <code style=\"color: inherit\">Series</code> resulted in <strong>elementwise</strong> application.
