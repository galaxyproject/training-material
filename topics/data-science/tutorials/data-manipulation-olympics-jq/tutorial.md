Scientific analyses often consist of a number of tools that run one after the other, in order to go from the raw data to scientific insight. Between these specialized tools, simple data manipulation steps are often needed as a kind of "glue" between tools. For example, the output of tool A may produce a file that contains all the information needed as input for tool B, but tool B expects the columns in a different order. Or in genomic data analysis, some tools expect chromosome X to be listed as `chrX`, while others simply expect `X`. In these situations, extra data manipulation steps are needed to prepare files for input to analysis tools.

<!--
Note to contributors: feel free to add sections here to include additional data manipulation options.
Make sure each section is independent of each other, i.e. each section should start with the olympics.tsv file.
Also make sure to include many exercises (with answers) for your section!
-->

Galaxy has a large collection of tools to perform such basic data manipulation tasks, and becoming familiar with these operations will allow to perform your analysis more easily in Galaxy (and outside).

# Cheatsheet

Here is an overview table of the different data manipulations in this tutorial, with links to the tools in Galaxy.

If you've opened this tutorial via the {% icon level %} icon in Galaxy (top menu bar), you can click on the tool names in the last column to quickly open them in Galaxy and start using them on your own!

# Background

In this tutorial, we will use as our dataset a table with results from the Olympics, from the games in Athens in 1896 until Tokyo in 2020. The objective is to familiarize you with a large number of the most important data manipulation tools in Galaxy. Much like the Olympics, there are many different disciplines (types of operations), and for each operation there are often multiple techniques (tools) available to athletes (data analysts, you) that are great for achieving the goal.

We will show you many of these commonly needed data manipulation operations, and some examples of how to perform them in Galaxy. We also provide many exercises so that you can train your skills and become a data manipulation Olympian!


# Download Data

Before we can do any manipulation, we will need some data. Let's download our table with Olympics results now.

We can use `jq` just by itself to pretty print the results:

```bash
cat olympics.json | jq -S . | head -n 20
```

## About this dataset

The data was [obtained](https://github.com/UOSCS/Olympic_Athletes) from [Olympedia](https://www.olympedia.org/). The file `olympics.json` contains
234,522 rows and 17 columns. Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual Olympic event. The columns are:

- **athlete_id** - Unique number for each athlete
- **name** - Athlete's name
- **sex** - M or F
- **birth_year** - 4-digit number
- **birth_day** - e.g. 24 July
- **birth_place** - town and/or country
- **height** - In centimeters (or `NA` if data not known)
- **weight** - In kilograms (or `NA` if data not known)
- **team** - Team name
- **noc** - National Olympic Committee 3-letter code
- **games** - Year and season
- **year** - Integer
- **season** - Summer or Winter
- **city** - Host city
- **sport** - Sport
- **event** - Event
- **medal** - Gold, Silver, Bronze (or `NA` if no medal was won)

We will use this dataset to practice our data manipulation skills in Galaxy.


# Choose your adventure!

This tutorial is structured a bit differently than most. **You do not have to do the steps in the order they are presented below.** Every section in this tutorial uses the dataset you just uploaded (the `olympics.json` file) as input, so you can jump to any section in this tutorial right now if you have a particular data manipulation operation in mind you want to learn more about.

# File Format Conversion

The file we uploaded is a `.json` file. This stands for *JavaScript Object Notation*. This means that this is a file containing arrays (`[]`) and objects (`{}`). 

First we need to understand a bit about file structure, and how JQ can convert back and forth between different structures:

The `.` operator is the identity operator, it gives you back exactly the same structure

```bash
echo '[{"a": 1}, {"a": 2}]' | jq '.'
```

You can use `.[]` to loop over the items in an array:

```bash
echo '[{"a": 1}, {"a": 2}]' | jq '.[]'
```

And supply a number to access an individual array item:

```bash
echo '[{"a": 1}, {"a": 2}]' | jq '.[0]'
```

And `.<key>` to access a specific key

```bash
echo '[{"a": 1}, {"a": 2}]' | jq '.[].a'
```

But that's not all! Sometimes you may want the resulting output to be back in an array, rather than by line:

```bash
echo '[{"a": 1}, {"a": 2}]' | jq '[.[].a]'
```

By wrapping the entire expression in `[]` we say we want the output of that statement in an array. We can actually do the same to get each entry as a new object:

```bash
echo '[{"a": 1}, {"a": 2}]' | jq '{"results": .[].a}'
```

Or an object with an array:

```bash
echo '[{"a": 1}, {"a": 2}]' | jq '{"results": [.[].a]}'
```

Or an array of objects:

```bash
echo '[{"a": 1}, {"a": 2}]' | jq '[{"results": .[].a}]'
```

We'll need to use these reshaping abilities as we go, to get data in the right shape to be worked with. Sometimes you'll want an array of objects, or objects with items in their keys.

## Pipes

Lastly, pipes are incredibly important in JQ, we'll use them to combine multiple filters, or make our pipelines more readable:

```bash
echo '[{"a": 1}, {"a": 2}]' | jq '.'
```

Here we pipe the entire incoming object (JQ operates on streams of JSON objects, so, there can be multiple), to the identity operator again but this time with `[]` to loop over every object in that item. (Really this is the same as `.[]` but we use a pipe for demonstration.)

```bash
echo '[{"a": 1}, {"a": 2}]' | jq '. | .[]'
```

We can then pass that stream of individual items (no longer a single JSON object) on to another filter, one extracting an `.a`:

```bash
echo '[{"a": 1}, {"a": 2}]' | jq '. | .[] | .a'
```


# Sorting

We have a lot of data in this file, but it is ordered by the athlete ID number, which is a somewhat arbitrary and meaningless number. But we can sort the rows in this file to something more convenient, for example alphabetically by name of the athlete, or chronologically by year of the Olympics.

In `jq` we can use the `sort` or `sort_by` function. From the documentation:

```bash
echo '[8,3,null,6]' | jq '.sort'
```

`sort_by` however lets us sort multiple entries in an array, by a child key:

```bash
echo '[{"foo":4, "bar":10}, {"foo":3, "bar":100}, {"foo":2, "bar":1}]' | jq '.sort_by(.foo)'
echo '[{"foo":4, "bar":10}, {"foo":3, "bar":100}, {"foo":2, "bar":1}]' | jq '.sort_by(.bar)'
```

So let's sort our file in chronological order, based on the year of the Olympic games:

> <question-title></question-title>
>
> 1. Which key contains the year?
> 2. Do we want ascending or descending order if we want the oldest games at the top?
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> >
> > 1. `.year`
> > 2. The file should be sorted in ascending (increasing) order
> >
> {: .solution}
{: .question}

```bash
cat olympics.json | jq -c 'sort_by(.year) | .[]'
```

> <tip-title>What does `.[]` do?</tip-title>
> We use this to first take the identity operator, taking exactly the array that was passed to us, and then `[]` lets us loop over the array, returning a stream of multiple individual objects. The `-c` flag lets us see that more easily, with one object per line.
{: .tip}

If we wanted to do it in reverse, we could just use the `reverse` function, or just use `-` prefixed to our sort factor.

```bash
cat olympics.json | jq -c 'sort_by(.year) | reverse | .[]'
cat olympics.json | jq -c 'sort_by(-.year) | .[]'
```

> <question-title></question-title>
>
> 1. Write a JQ command to access only the first entry.
> 2. Which athlete is listed at the top of the file now?
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> > 1. We can simply access the 0th element:
> >    ```bash
> >    cat olympics.json | jq -c 'sort_by(.year) | .[0]'
> >    ```

> >
> {: .solution}
{: .question}

**Rename** the resulting file to somthing meaningful (e.g. `olympics-chronological.json`)

This is great, but maybe it would make more sense to sort alphabetically by athlete name *within each year*.

## Sort on multiple columns at once

So we want to sort twice, first by year, an then within each year, we sort again alphabetically by name. The `sort_by` function can do this too!

We will sort the file in chronological order based on the year of the Olympic games

```bash
cat olympics.json | jq -c 'sort_by(.year, .name) | .[]'
```

# Filtering

This file contains a lot of data, but we may only be interested in a subset of this data. For example, we may only want to look at one particular Olympics, or one particular sport. In such cases we can filter the dataset. This will create a new dataset, removing any rows that are not of interest to us (i.e. that don't meet the criteria we provide).


We will filter the file to show only winter Olympics
Look at the `olympics.json` file and answer the following questions

> <question-title></question-title>
>
> 1. Which key contains this information?
> 2. Which values can this column have? (make sure to notice capitalisation, 'Winter' is not the same as 'winter' to these tools)
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> >
> > 1. `.season`
> > 2. The values can be `Summer` or `Winter` (`jq -c '[.[].season] | sort | unique' < olympics.json`)
> >
> {: .solution}
{: .question}

We'll be using the `select()` filter to select entries matching specific conditions:

> <question-title></question-title>
>
> 1. How would you write the expressions for the following conditions:
>    1. `enrolled` must be 'Yes'
>    2. `age` must be smaller than 75

>    4. `birthplace` cannot be empty
>
> 2. It is also possible to combine multiple conditions, using `and`, `or`, `not` and parentheses
>    How would you write expressions for the following filtering conditions:
>    1. `height` is larger than 200 or smaller than 160
>    2. `height` is larger than 200 and smaller than 210
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>

Ok, great, now that you've got the hang of writing expressions for this tool, let's create a file with only Winter Olympics. Make sure it is contained in an array, in case we want to do further sorting.

```bash
jq -c '[.[] | select(.season == "Winter")]' < olympics.json > winter.json
```

> <question-title></question-title>

**Repeat** the step for the Summer Olympics

```bash
jq -c '[.[] | select(.season == "Summer")]' < olympics.json > summer.json
```

# Counting

A common operation we might want to perform on tables of data, is simple counting. How many times does a certain value appear? For our dataset for instance, we might want to know how many countries participated in each Olympics, how many women, etc; any column that has categorical data that we can count.

Let's start by simply counting how many different Olympic Games we have in our dataset, and how many times it appears (so how many participations there were each year)

We'll need to use the `group_by` filter which takes a key, and then emits arrays with objects with those matching keys:

```bash
echo '[{"foo":1, "bar":10}, {"foo":3, "bar":100}, {"foo":1, "bar":1}]' | jq 'group_by(.foo)
```

So let's try that with ours:

```bash
jq '. | group_by(.year)' < olympics.json
```

We now have a structure like

```
[
    [
        {"year" 1896, ...},
        {"year" 1896, ...},
        {"year" 1896, ...}
    ],
    [
        {"year" 1900, ...},
        {"year" 1900, ...},
        {"year" 1900, ...}
    ],
    ...
]
```

We'll re-structure to one "year group" per line:

```bash
jq '. | group_by(.year) | .[]' < olympics.json
```

So we can again use the `length` function to determine how many items are in each via

```bash
jq '. | group_by(.year) | .[] | [. | length]' < olympics.json
```

And all that's left is to include the game name:

```bash
jq '. | group_by(.year) | .[] | [. | length, .[0].games]' < olympics.json
```

But the output format is not so nice, so let's introduce the `@tsv` filter to turn the resulting data into a table:

```bash
jq '. | group_by(.year) | .[] | [. | length, .[0].games] | @tsv' < olympics.json
```

Where did the " and `\t` come from? We don't want those! That is a result of the resulting data being in a JSON string, so we can tell jq to use `raw` mode with `-r`

```bash
jq -r '. | group_by(.year) | .[] | [. | length, .[0].games] | @tsv' < olympics.json
```

You may have guessed that like `sort_by`, that we could have selected multiple columns in the `group_by` step. This lets us count on combinations of columns.

Let's try counting the number of men and women in each olympic games.

```bash
jq '. | group_by(.games, .sex) | .[] | [. | length, .[0].games, .[0].sex] | @tsv' -r < olympics.json
```

Let's say we wanted to know how many different sports there were in each Olympics. If we used the counting tool above, we would get a results file for each combination of sport and olympics, with the number of lines (participations) of each. But we don't really care about the number of lines that have this combination, just the total number of unique sports in each games.

We can use the `unique` filter in our pipeline to discover this. First let's do our group by and iterate over each resulting group:

```bash
jq '. | group_by(.games) | .[]' < olympics.json
```

For fun this time let's organise the output as an object. We know one value we want is the games:

```bash
jq '. | group_by(.games) | .[] | {"games": .[0].games}' < olympics.json
```

But the other we want is the list of sports. We can use our `.[]` to loop over every sport item in that group

```bash
jq '. | group_by(.games) | .[] | {"games": .[0].games, "sports": [.[].sport] }' < olympics.json
```

We're almost there! We just need to unique this list and determine it's length:

```bash
jq '. | group_by(.games) | .[] | {"games": .[0].games, "sports": [.[].sport] | unique | length }' < olympics.json
```

Or if you preferred as a table. But here it seems we can wrap it in `()` to make the parsing clearer:

```bash
jq '. | group_by(.games) | .[] | [.[0].games, ([.[].sport] | unique | length)] | @tsv' -r < olympics.json
```

# Computing

Sometimes we want to use the data in our column to compute a new value, and add that to the table. For instance, for our dataset we could caluclate athtletes BMI (using height and weight columns), or their age at time of participation (from year of birth and year of the Olymics). By adding these computed values as a new colum to our datset, we can more easily query the dataset for these values. We can do these types of operations using the `+=` operation on a given object.

As an example, let's calculate the age of each athlete at the time of participation, and add this as a new column to our dataset.

First let's structure our query to loop over every object in the array:

```bash
jq '.[]' < olympics.json
```

Then let's try adding a static value to it:

```bash
jq '.[] | . += {"marco": "polo"}' < olympics.json
```

Do you see the resulting key in the new file? Ok, let's replace it with a computed value:

```bash
jq '.[] | . += {"age": .year - .birth_year}' < olympics.json
```

This errors, but JQ is a bit sensitive to syntax, so we can add some `()` to make things more explicit

```bash
jq '.[] | . += {"age": (.year - .birth_year)}' < olympics.json
```

Ah and then we discover null values!

```bash
jq '.[] | select(.birth_year != null) | . += {"age": (.year - .birth_year)}' < olympics.json
```

And there we go! But this is structured as a stream of objects, maybe we want it again as an array `[]` to ensure it remains in the same shape as our input dataset.

```bash
jq '[.[] | select(.birth_year != null) | . += {"age": (.year - .birth_year)}]' < olympics.json > olympics-with-age.json
```

This was a simple computation, but much more complex mathematical expressions can be computed with this tool. See the help section at the bottom of the tool for a list of all supported operations. In the exercise below, we will compute the BMI for each athlete as an example.


## Exercises

BMI stands for Body Mass Index, is a metric to provide a very crude measure of how healthy your weight is. The formula to compute BMI is:

$$ BMI = weight / (height^2) $$

(with weight in kilograms and height in meters).

> <tip-title>BMI is problematic</tip-title>
> [Adolphe Quetelet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolphe_Quetelet), who invented [BMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index), was not a doctor of medicine, instead he was a Belgian astronomer, mathematician, statistician, and sociologist. His data consisted probably entirely of cisgender, white, european men and women {% cite Eknoyan_2007 %}.
> In his defense, he did argue it should not be used at individual levels, however it came to be used as such due to simplicity. (See [Wikipedia's History section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index#History)). BMI is a poor measure of health, especially for populations with high muscle content, and cannot be simply re-used as-is with anyone other than Anglo Saxons {% cite Caleyachetty_2021 %}, [Wikipedia:Limitations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index#Limitations).
>
> However as it is an easy to calculate metric, we include the calculation here.

# Find and Replace

Often you may need to change the contents of a file a bit to fit the expectations of an analysis tool. For instance, our file uses `NA` for missing values, but other conventions included leaving the cell empty, or using `NaN` (not a number) instead. Or, when working with chromosomal data, you may need to add or remove the `chr` prefix from a column before using it as input to a certain tool. In such situations, we can find all occurrences of a certain pattern in our file, and replace it with another value.

If we want to perform such a replacement on a single column in our data, we can use the `gsub` function.

A few of the basics of regular expression, plus some links to further resources are given in the box below:

{% snippet faqs/galaxy/analysis_regular_expressions.md %}

Let's start with a simple example:
Our file uses a mix of `Athina` and `Athens` to indicate the Capital City of Greece in the `city` column.
Let's standardize this by replacing occurrences of `Athina` with `Athens`.

Let's start by filtering out the old spelling:

```bash
jq '.[] | select(.city == "Athina")' < olympics.json
```

We can access just the .city and try out our gsub next:

```bash
jq '.[] | select(.city == "Athina") | .city | gsub("Athina"; "Athens")' < olympics.json
```

Looks good! Let's use the technique we learned in [Computing](#computing) to update the key with a new key.

```bash
jq '.[] | select(.city == "Athina") | . += {"city": (.city | gsub("Athina"; "Athens"))}' < olympics.json
```

Also looks good, ok, that's it!

```bash
jq '[.[] | . += {"city": (.city | gsub("Athina"; "Athens"))}]' < olympics.json
```


Look at the file before and after. Athlete 7 (Patrick Chila) near the top of the `olympics.tsv` file, had a value of Athina in the city column. Verify that it has been changed to Athens.

This was rather simple example, so let's try a few more examples with slightly more complex expressions.


## Exercises

You may have noticed that our file has a lot of missing data. Especially for the earlier years, things like height, weight and birthday of athletes was not registered, or simply not known. In some columns you see these missing values have been replaced with an `NA` (not available) value. In other columns (for example birth place), the cells have simply been left empty.

Different tools may expect different ways of handling missing data. So you may have to change your missing data from empty to `NA`, `NaN`, or something else, between analysis steps

Let's do another example, this one using capture groups.

Look at the `birth_day` column. It has values in a format like `12 December`. Suppose we have a tool that expects this data to be in the reverse format, `December 12`. The file is too big to change this manually in every column. But with regular expression tools we can make this replacement easily

We will now change the format in birthday column from `day month` to `month day`, as our boss is American and requested the silly format.

# Removing Columns

We can remove columns from a table using either `del(.key)` if we just want to remove a few values, or otherwise by selecting, if we just want to keep a few values.

Suppose we want to simplify our file a bit. All we want is file with 4 columns: athlete name, sport, olympic games, and medals.

We can most easily do this by returning an array:

```bash
jq '.[] | [.name, .sport, .games, .medal]' < olympics.json
```

But perhaps we want something a bit more structured:

```bash
jq '.[] | {"name": .name, "sport": .sport, "games": .games, "medal": .medal}' < olympics.json
```

And of course we'll keep our list shape:

```bash
jq '[.[] | {"name": .name, "sport": .sport, "games": .games, "medal": .medal}]' < olympics.json > subset.json
```

Notice that during this step, we also changed the order of the keys. This tool can also be used to re-arrange keys, if you supply all key names but in a different order.

# Unique

Sometimes, in the course of our data manipulations, we may end up with a file that has duplicate values. In order to filter these out, we can use the `unique` filter.

Let's say we would like to create a list of all unique athletes (id and name).

First we will cut just the `athlete_id` and `name` columns from our dataset

```bash
jq '.[] | {"name": .name, "athlete_id": .athlete_id}' < olympics.json
```

> <question-title></question-title>

{: .question}

Now let's remove those duplicates. For this filter to work, it needs to be passed an array, not individual values in a stream:

```bash
jq '[.[] | {"name": .name, "athlete_id": .athlete_id}] | unique' < olympics.json
```

# Joining Files

This file contains a lot of information, but we may want to add more information. For example if we had a file with information about each country (population, capital city, etc), we could join that information with our Olympics data, to get a single file with all information in every row.

For example, if we would like to be able to group by continent, to e.g. count athletes, medals etc per continent, we will have to add a `continent` column to our file. To do this we would need a second file that maps each country to the corresponding continent. This is what we will do in the next hands-on section.

We obtained country information data from [DataHub](https://datahub.io/core/country-codes). More information about this file can be found in the description there. It has 56 columns with a wide variety of data about each country (from country codes, to capital city, languages spoken, etc)

{: .question}

We would now like to take our Olympics dataset as the basis, and add columns to every row of this file with some information about the country. In order to join, we will need to have one column that is shared between the two files, on which we can match. The `NOC` column is perfect for this because it is a defined standard. Both files also contain a column with the country name in it, which is also a possible candidate to use for joining, but because it is less standardised, it is safer to use the NOC column. For example, if one file uses "Netherlands", while the other uses "The Netherlands" to indicate the same country, the joining will fail for these rows. So always make sure the columns you join on are compatible!

We can use the join and index commands, per [SQL Style Operators](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#SQL-StyleOperators) documentation and [this stack overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72609410)

```bash
jq '[JOIN(INDEX(input[]; .NOC); .[]; .noc; add)]' olympics.json country-information.json

# Concatenating

Concatenation of two files simple means putting the contents of the two files together, one after the other. Our dataset was created in 2021, but since then we've had another Olympic event, the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. If we have the same data for this latest Olympics, we could simply add the rows from the 2022 games to our current file with data, in order to create a single file with all data from 1896 to 2022.

First, let's get this data for the 2022 Olympics

```
wget {{page.zenodo_link}}/files/olympics_2022.json
```

View the new dataset, does it have the same structure as our original `olympics.json` file?

It is best to remove the header line from the second dataset after we have verified it is compatible. This way we will only add the real data rows to our dataset.
> >
> {: .solution}
{: .question}

Since this new dataset has the exact same structure (number and order of columns), we can simple add the lines from this file to the end of our existing `olympics.json` file.
For this, we'll need to use a new argument to `jq`, namely `-s` or `--slurp` which allows us to access all files as if they were one big indexed array.

```bash
cat olympics.json olympics_2022.json | jq -s '.[0] + .[1]' > olympics-combined.json
```

Alternatively we could loop over every array in the parent, and combine them. This would support more than two files:

```bash
cat olympics.json olympics_2022.json | jq -s '[.[][]]' > olympics-combined.json
```

Now this only works so simply because our two datasets had the same structure; two arrays. If your data comes from different sources, you may have to do some additional data manipulation before you can concatenate, e.g. to make sure the columns match, or how each file deals with missing data (empty cells, `NA`, `NaN` or something else).


# Splitting Files

This dataset contains a lot of data, we might want to split the data into one file per Olympic games, or have one file for all the winter games, and another file for all the summer games. In these situtations, where we want to create new, smaller files, based on the values in a column, we can use the tool.

> <tip-title>Not generically possible with only JQ</tip-title>
> It is not generically possible to e.g. split a file by value, with only jq. We need to use other tools, e.g. for loops, in addition to accomplish this.
{: .tip}

We would like to create a separate file for each Olympic event. First let's get a list of every event.

```bash
jq '[.[] | .games] | unique[]' -r < olympics.json
```

Easily done. Now we'll construct a loop over these results

```bash
jq '[.[] | .games] | unique[]' -r < olympics.json | while read -r game; do
    echo "Game: $game";
done
```

Here we can then use this to create a new file per the game identifier:

```bash
jq '[.[] | .games] | unique[]' -r < olympics.json | while read -r game; do
    echo "Selecting: $game";
    jq '[.[] | select(.games == "'$game'")]' < olympics.json > olympics-"$game".json
done
```

# Conclusion

These tools and operations covered in the tutorial are just a few examples of some of the most common operations. There are many more tools available in Galaxy that perform other data manipulations. We encourage you to look around the `General Text Tools` section in the Galaxy toolbox (left panel) to find and explore more data manipulation tools. The more comfortable you are performing these kinds of steps, the more you can get out of Galaxy!


# Exercises: Putting it all together!

This section provides a number of exercises that require you to combine two or more of the techniques you learned in this tutorial. This is a great way to practice your data manipulation skills. Full solutions are provided for every exercise (i.e. all tools and settings), but for many of these exercises there will be multiple solutions, so if you obtained the same results in a different way, that is correct too!

Ok, let's try another exercise! You might have noticed that some of the values in the weight column were classes, e.g. `63-78` (kg).
In this exercise, we will first clean up this weight column to avoid ranges (by taking the lower number in the range for every
row a weight range is used), and then answering the question a couple of questions around the weight of athletes.

> <question-title noprefix>Exercise 2: Data cleaning and computations of the weight column</question-title>
>
> 1. Get a list of all the values that occur in the weight value, take note of all the values that are not a single number or `NA`; anything else should be cleaned up
> 2. Clean up the weight value so that we only have single numbers; weight classes (e.g. `63-78`) should be replace by the lower bound (`63`) of that class
> 3. How heavy was the lightest woman competing in the Biathlon? And the heaviest?
>
> > <solution-title noprefix>Hints</solution-title>
> >
> > 1. You can use ` | sort | uniq -c` (the unix tools) to simplify some of the counting.
> > 2. You can use the `gsub` filter to clean up the weight.
> >    This tool is a bit complex, if you haven't done so yet, we strongly recommend you work through the [Find and Replace section](#find-and-replace) first.
> >    To check if your cleaning worked, re-run the counting from step 1.

> > 1. We see values such as `100-105`, but also `77,5`, `100, 104` (notice the space!) and even `76, 77, 79` to indicate weight ranges or other unexpected weight values.
> >    All these variations must be converted to single numbers. For this example we will simply convert these ranges to their lower number, and remove the rest when we
