                <p>Try/except are a construct in Python used to catch a potential exception. Sometimes things go wrong in your code! Or in someone else’s code in a module. Sometimes some errors might be expected like when you try and read a user supplied file, maybe it isn’t available because they’ve specified the wrong path.</p>

<h2 id="raise">Raise</h2>

<p>When you’re writing code, sometimes there are errors you might need to handle:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you’re calculating the mean of a set of numbers, and the list is empty. You don’t want to divide by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">len(numbers)</code> and trigger a Zero Division Error.</li>
  <li>If you’re opening a file, there maybe a chance that the file is not found.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using try/excepts allow you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide friendlier and more useful error messages</li>
  <li>handle expected error cases</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, returning to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mean()</code> function example, what should <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mean([])</code> return for a hypothetical mean function that calculates the average of a list of numbers. Should it return 0? It probably should return an error. Let’s look at some example code:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">mean</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">numbers</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nf">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">numbers</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="nf">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">numbers</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="nf">mean</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="nf">mean</span><span class="p">([])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This raises a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ZeroDivisionError</code>  but we can make this a more friendly error message by raising our own exception.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">mean</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">numbers</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">numbers</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="nc">ValueError</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">You are calculating the mean of an empty list, which is not possible.</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nf">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">numbers</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="nf">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">numbers</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="nf">mean</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="nf">mean</span><span class="p">([])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <div class="box-title tip-title" id="tip-where-do-valueerror-zerodivisionerror-come-from-1"><button class="gtn-boxify-button tip" type="button" aria-controls="tip-where-do-valueerror-zerodivisionerror-come-from-1" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Tip: Where do ValueError, ZeroDivisionError come from?</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>
  <p>There are loads of different types of exception codes! <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html">The python documentation has a large list</a> of exceptions and some descriptions for when or why those exceptions might be raised.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we get a much more useful error message from the function! Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">raise</code> is especially important for <em>library authors</em>, people writing python modules that we all use. If they provide useful error messages, it helps you as an end user understand what’s happening.</p>

<h2 id="try--except">Try &amp; Except</h2>

<p>Let’s look at how you would handle one of these exceptions, we’ll continue with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mean()</code> example above.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
<span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">mean</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">numbers</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">Result is </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">result</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">except</span> <span class="nb">ValueError</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">We cannot calculate the mean</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">try:</code> to setup a new block, and this code is <strong>tried</strong>, Python attempts to execute it. Below are one or more <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">except:</code> blocks which catch specific errors. Here we have specifically said we know a ValueError can happen, and decided to handle it.</p>

<p>Or for another example, accessing a user supplied file. Oftentimes users will call your program and supply a non-existent, or inacessible file. Here you can use multiple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">except</code> blocks to catch all of those potential errors.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">user_supplied_file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">does-not-exist.txt</span><span class="sh">'</span>
<span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nf">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user_supplied_file</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">r</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">except</span> <span class="nb">FileNotFoundError</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">The path you supplied (</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">user_supplied_file</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s">) doesn</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">t exist, please double check it!</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">except</span> <span class="n">PermissionError</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">You supplied a valid file, but it is unreadable. Try changing it</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">s permissions with `chmod +r </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">user_supplied_file</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s">`</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Failing to open a file raises a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileNotFoundError</code> which indicates the file isn’t available, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PermissionError</code> indicates that a file is unreadable. However in practice, sometimes you’ll see something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Bad!
try:
    doSomething()
except:
    print("error")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is called a <strong>bare exception</strong>, and will catch any exception, compared with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">except ValueError</code> which only catches value errors. People consider this generally a bad idea, termed <em>code smell</em>. (Because it smells (appears) bad!)</p>

<h2 id="finally">Finally</h2>

<p>The last portion of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">try:</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">except:</code> block is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">finally:</code>, a third block which lets us do cleanup. It’s often very nice to your users that if your program fails halfway through, that you cleanup after yourself.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">os</span>

<span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nf">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">gene_query.fa</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">w</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">handle</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">handle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">&gt;some fasta sequence we want to search against a database</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="c1"># runQuery('gene_query.fa')
</span>
    <span class="c1"># But here we have an error! Something goes wrong!
</span>    <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="k">except</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="c1"># And now our results are invalid.
</span>    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">Something went wrong! Oh no! Check your inputs.</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">finally</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="c1"># So we should cleanup this temporary file we created, so it doesn't cause
</span>    <span class="c1"># problems or distract the user from the results file.
</span>    <span class="c1"># This function will delete a file from your computer:
</span>    <span class="n">os</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">remove</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">gene_query.fa</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="fallback">Fallback</h2>

<p>Sometimes we can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">try</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">except</code> to have a fallback option. Consider the pseudocode below:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>try:
    runBlast()
except BlastNotAvailable:
    try:
        runBLAT()
    except BLATnotAvailable:
        print("Neither Blast nor BLAT were available.")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sometimes you have a fallback option, some other tool you can use in its place. When that’s possible, you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">try</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">except</code> to handle those cases and work around potential issues. But this isn’t always the case, sometimes you just need to print your error message and stop executing code.</p>
