<h1 id="background">Background</h1>

<p>Humans and computers commonly interact in many different ways, such as through a keyboard and mouse,
touch screen interfaces, or using speech recognition systems.
The most widely used way to interact with personal computers is called a
<strong>graphical user interface</strong> (GUI).
With a GUI, we give instructions by clicking a mouse and using menu-driven interactions.</p>

<p>While the visual aid of a GUI makes it intuitive to learn,
this way of delivering instructions to a computer scales very poorly.
Imagine the following task:
for a literature search, you have to copy the third line of one thousand text files in one thousand
different directories and paste it into a single file.
Using a GUI, you would not only be clicking at your desk for several hours,
but you could potentially also commit an error in the process of completing this repetitive task.
This is where we take advantage of the Unix shell.
The Unix shell is both a <strong>command-line interface</strong> (CLI) and a scripting language,
allowing such repetitive tasks to be done automatically and fast.
With the proper commands, the shell can repeat tasks with or without some modification
as many times as we want.
Using the shell, the task in the literature example can be accomplished in seconds.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>Before we do anything, we’ll get you setup with some test data which can help
guide your exploration of the CLI.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/
<span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> Desktop/
<span class="nb">cd </span>Desktop/
wget <span class="nt">-c</span> https://github.com/swcarpentry/shell-novice/raw/2929ba2cbb1bcb5ff0d1b4100c6e58b96e155fd1/data/shell-lesson-data.zip
unzip <span class="nt">-u</span> shell-lesson-data.zip
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="the-shell">The Shell</h2>

<p>The shell is a program where users can type commands.
With the shell, it’s possible to invoke complicated programs like climate modeling software
or simple commands that create an empty directory with only one line of code.
The most popular Unix shell is Bash (the Bourne Again SHell —
so-called because it’s derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne).
Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix and in most packages that provide
Unix-like tools for Windows.</p>

<p>Using the shell will take some effort and some time to learn.
While a GUI presents you with choices to select, CLI choices are not automatically presented to you,
so you must learn a few commands like new vocabulary in a language you’re studying.
However, unlike a spoken language, a small number of “words” (i.e. commands) gets you a long way,
and we’ll cover those essential few today.</p>

<p>The grammar of a shell allows you to combine existing tools into powerful
pipelines and handle large volumes of data automatically. Sequences of
commands can be written into a <em>script</em>, improving the reproducibility of
workflows.</p>

<p>In addition, the command line is often the easiest way to interact with remote machines
and supercomputers.
Familiarity with the shell is near essential to run a variety of specialized tools and resources
including high-performance computing systems.
As clusters and cloud computing systems become more popular for scientific data crunching,
being able to interact with the shell is becoming a necessary skill.
We can build on the command-line skills covered here
to tackle a wide range of scientific questions and computational challenges.</p>

<p>Let’s get started.</p>

<p>When the shell is first opened, you are presented with a <strong>prompt</strong>,
indicating that the shell is waiting for input.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The shell typically uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ </code> as the prompt, but may use a different symbol.
In the examples for this lesson, we will <strong>not</strong> include this prompt!</p>

<p>Most importantly:
when typing commands, either from these lessons or from other sources,
<em>do not type the prompt</em>, only the commands that follow it.
Also note that after you type a command, you have to press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to execute it.</p>

<p>The prompt is followed by a <strong>text cursor</strong>, a character that indicates the position where your
typing will appear.
The cursor is usually a flashing or solid block, but it can also be an underscore or a pipe.
You may have seen it in a text editor program, for example.</p>

<p>So let’s try our first command, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> which is short for listing.</p>

<h2 id="nelles-pipeline-a-typical-problem">Nelle’s Pipeline: A Typical Problem</h2>

<p>Nelle Nemo, a marine biologist,
has just returned from a six-month survey of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific_Gyre">North Pacific Gyre</a>,
where she has been sampling gelatinous marine life in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch">Great Pacific Garbage Patch</a>.
She has 1520 samples that she’s run through an assay machine to measure the relative abundance
of 300 proteins.
She needs to run these 1520 files through an imaginary program called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">goostats.sh</code> she inherited.
On top of this huge task, she has to write up results by the end of the month so her paper
can appear in a special issue of <em>Aquatic Goo Letters</em>.</p>

<p>The bad news is that if she has to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">goostats.sh</code> by hand using a GUI,
she’ll have to select and open a file 1520 times.
If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">goostats.sh</code> takes 30 seconds to run each file, the whole process will take more than 12 hours
of Nelle’s attention.
With the shell, Nelle can instead assign her computer this mundane task while she focuses
her attention on writing her paper.</p>

<p>The next few lessons will explore the ways Nelle can achieve this.
More specifically,
they explain how she can use a command shell to run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">goostats.sh</code> program,
using loops to automate the repetitive steps of entering file names,
so that her computer can work while she writes her paper.</p>

<p>As a bonus,
once she has put a processing pipeline together,
she will be able to use it again whenever she collects more data.</p>

<p>In order to achieve her task, Nelle needs to know how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>navigate to a file/directory</li>
  <li>create a file/directory</li>
  <li>check the length of a file</li>
  <li>chain commands together</li>
  <li>retrieve a set of files</li>
  <li>iterate over files</li>
  <li>run a shell script containing her pipeline</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="navigating-files-and-directories">Navigating Files and Directories</h1>

<p>The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories
is called the <strong>file system</strong>.
It organizes our data into files,
which hold information,
and directories (also called ‘folders’),
which hold files or other directories.</p>

<p>Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.
To start exploring them, we’ll go to our open shell window.</p>

<p>First, let’s find out where we are by running a command called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code>
(which stands for ‘print working directory’). Directories are like <em>places</em>, at any time
while we are using the shell, we are in exactly one place called
our <strong>current working directory</strong>. Commands mostly read and write files in the
current working directory, i.e. ‘here’, so knowing where you are before running
a command is important. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> shows you where you are:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">pwd</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Try running it now.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <div class="box-title tip-title" id="tip-home-directory-variation-1"><button class="gtn-boxify-button tip" type="button" aria-controls="tip-home-directory-variation-1" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Tip: Home Directory Variation</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p>The home directory path will look different on different operating systems.</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Linux</th>
        <th>OSX</th>
        <th>Jupyter (UseGalaxy/Binder)</th>
        <th>CoCalc</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/nelle</code></td>
        <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users/nelle</code></td>
        <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/joyvan</code></td>
        <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/projects/&lt;id&gt;</code></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>On Windows, it will be similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:\Documents and Settings\nelle</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:\Users\nelle</code>.
(Note that it may look slightly different for different versions of Windows.)
In future examples, we’ve used Mac output as the default - Linux and Windows
output may differ slightly but should be generally similar.</p>

  <p>We will also assume that your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> command returns your user’s home directory.
If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> returns something different, you may need to navigate there using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>
or some commands in this lesson will not work as written.
See <a href="#exploring-other-directories">Exploring Other Directories</a> for more details
on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> command.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To understand what a ‘home directory’ is,
let’s have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized.  For the
sake of this example, we’ll be
illustrating the filesystem on our scientist Nelle’s computer.  After this
illustration, you’ll be learning commands to explore your own filesystem,
which will be constructed in a similar way, but not be exactly identical.</p>

<p>On Nelle’s computer, the filesystem looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="../../images/carpentries-cli/filesystem.svg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/carpentries-cli/filesystem.svg" alt="The file system is made up of a root directory that contains sub-directories titled bin, data, users, and tmp. " width="54" height="29" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

<p>At the top is the <strong>root directory</strong>
that holds everything else.
We refer to it using a slash character, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>, on its own;
this character is the leading slash in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users/nelle</code>.</p>

<p>Inside that directory are several other directories:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin</code> (which is where some built-in programs are stored),
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code> (for miscellaneous data files),
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Users</code> (where users’ personal directories are located),
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmp</code> (for temporary files that don’t need to be stored long-term),
and so on.</p>

<p>We know that our current working directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users/nelle</code> is stored inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users</code>
because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users</code> is the first part of its name.
Similarly,
we know that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users</code> is stored inside the root directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>
because its name begins with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <div class="box-title tip-title" id="tip-slashes-1"><button class="gtn-boxify-button tip" type="button" aria-controls="tip-slashes-1" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Tip: Slashes</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p>Notice that there are two meanings for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> character.
When it appears at the front of a file or directory name,
it refers to the root directory. When it appears <em>inside</em> a path,
it’s just a separator.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Underneath <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users</code>,
we find one directory for each user with an account on Nelle’s machine,
her colleagues <em>imhotep</em> and <em>larry</em>.</p>

<p><a href="../../images/carpentries-cli/home-directories.svg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/carpentries-cli/home-directories.svg" alt="Like other directories, home directories are sub-directories underneath '/Users' like '/Users/imhotep', '/Users/larry' or '/Users/nelle'. " width="55" height="50" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

<p>The user <em>imhotep</em>’s files are stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users/imhotep</code>,
user <em>larry</em>’s in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users/larry</code>,
and Nelle’s in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users/nelle</code>.  Because Nelle is the user in our
examples here, therefore we get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users/nelle</code> as our home directory.
Typically, when you open a new command prompt, you will be in
your home directory to start.</p>

<p>Now let’s learn the command that will let us see the contents of our
own filesystem.  We can see what’s in our home directory by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory.
We can make its output more comprehensible by using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-F</code> <strong>option</strong>
(also known as a <strong>switch</strong> or a <strong>flag</strong>),
which tells <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> to classify the output
by adding a marker to file and directory names to indicate what they are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a trailing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> indicates that this is a directory</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@</code> indicates a link</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> indicates an executable</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on your default options,
the shell might also use colors to indicate whether each entry is a file or
directory.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls</span> <span class="nt">-F</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here,
we can see that our home directory contains only <strong>sub-directories</strong>.
Any names in our output that don’t have a classification symbol
are plain old <strong>files</strong>.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">

<h3 id="getting-help">Getting help</h3>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> has lots of other <strong>options</strong>. There are two common ways to find out how
to use a command and what options it accepts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We can pass a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--help</code> option to the command,</li>
  <li>We can read its manual with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man</code></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="the---help-option">The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--help</code> option</h4>

<p>Many bash commands, and programs that people have written that can be
run from within bash, support a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--help</code> option to display more
information on how to use the command or program.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls</span> <span class="nt">--help</span>

  <p>If you try to use an option (flag) that is not supported, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> and other commands
will usually print an error message similar to:</p>

<p>This command will turn your terminal into a page with a description
of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command and its options.</p>

<p>To navigate through the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man</code> pages,
you may use <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> to move line-by-line,
or try <kbd>B</kbd> and <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> to skip up and down by a full page.
To search for a character or word in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man</code> pages,
use <kbd>/</kbd> followed by the character or word you are searching for.
Sometimes a search will result in multiple hits.
If so, you can move between hits using <kbd>N</kbd> (for moving forward) and
<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> (for moving backward).</p>

<p>To <strong>quit</strong> the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man</code> pages, press <kbd>Q</kbd>.</p>

<h3 id="exploring-other-directories">Exploring Other Directories</h3>

<p>Not only can we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> on the current working directory,
but we can use it to list the contents of a different directory.
Let’s take a look at our current directory by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -F ~/</code>,
i.e.,
the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-F</code> <strong>option</strong> and the <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/reference.html#argument"><strong>argument</strong></a>  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>.
The argument <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/</code> tells <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> that
we want a listing of something other than our current working directory:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls</span> <span class="nt">-F</span> ~/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you may now see, using a bash shell is strongly dependent on the idea that
your files are organized in a hierarchical file system.
Organizing things hierarchically in this way helps us keep track of our work:
it’s possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory,
just as it’s possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk,
but it’s a self-defeating strategy.</p>

<p>Now that we know the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shell-lesson-data</code> directory is located in current working directory, we
can do two things.</p>

<p>First, we can look at its contents, using the same strategy as before, passing
a directory name to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls</span> <span class="nt">-F</span> shell-lesson-data
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Second, we can actually change our location to a different directory, so
we are no longer located in
our home directory.</p>

<p>The command to change locations is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> followed by a
directory name to change our working directory.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> stands for ‘change directory’,
which is a bit misleading:
the command doesn’t change the directory;
it changes the shell’s idea of what directory we are in.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> command is akin to double clicking a folder in a graphical interface to get into a folder.</p>

<p>Let’s say we want to move to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code> directory we saw above. We can
use the following series of commands to get there:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd </span>shell-lesson-data
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These commands will move us into
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shell-lesson-data</code> directory, then into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code> directory.
You will notice that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> doesn’t print anything. This is normal.
Many shell commands will not output anything to the screen when successfully executed.
But if we run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> after it, we can see that we are now
in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/data</code>.
If we run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -F</code> without arguments now,
it lists the contents of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/data</code>,
because that’s where we now are:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">pwd</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls</span> <span class="nt">-F</span> data/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We now know how to go down the directory tree (i.e. how to go into a subdirectory),
but how do we go up (i.e. how do we leave a directory and go into its parent directory)?
We might try the following:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd </span>shell-lesson-data
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But we get an error! Why is this?</p>

<p>With our methods so far,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> can only see sub-directories inside your current directory. There are
different ways to see directories above your current location; we’ll start
with the simplest.</p>

<p>There is a shortcut in the shell to move up one directory level
that looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd</span> ..
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">..</code> is a special directory name meaning
“the directory containing this one”,
or more succinctly,
the <strong>parent</strong> of the current directory.
Sure enough,
if we run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> after running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd ..</code>, we’re back in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data</code>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">pwd</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The special directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">..</code> doesn’t usually show up when we run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>. If we want
to display it, we can add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-a</code> option to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -F</code>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls</span> <span class="nt">-F</span> <span class="nt">-a</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-a</code> stands for ‘show all’;
it forces <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> to show us file and directory names that begin with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code>,
such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">..</code> (which, if we’re in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users/nelle</code>, refers to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users</code> directory).
As you can see,
it also displays another special directory that’s just called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code>,
which means ‘the current working directory’.
It may seem redundant to have a name for it,
but we’ll see some uses for it soon.</p>

<p>Note that in most command line tools, multiple options can be combined
with a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> and no spaces between the options: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -F -a</code> is
equivalent to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -Fa</code>.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <div class="box-title tip-title" id="tip-other-hidden-files-1"><button class="gtn-boxify-button tip" type="button" aria-controls="tip-other-hidden-files-1" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Tip: Other Hidden Files</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p>In addition to the hidden directories <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">..</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code>, you may also see a file
called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bash_profile</code>. This file usually contains shell configuration
settings. You may also see other files and directories beginning
with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code>. These are usually files and directories that are used to configure
different programs on your computer. The prefix <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code> is used to prevent these
configuration files from cluttering the terminal when a standard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command
is used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These three commands are the basic commands for navigating the filesystem on your computer:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>. Let’s explore some variations on those commands. What happens
if you type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> on its own, without giving
a directory?</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How can you check what happened? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> gives us the answer!</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">pwd</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It turns out that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> without an argument will return you to your home directory,
which is great if you’ve gotten lost in your own filesystem.</p>

<p>Let’s try returning to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code> directory from before. Last time, we used
three commands, but we can actually string together the list of directories
to move to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code> in one step:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/data
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Check that we’ve moved to the right place by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -F</code>.</p>

<p>If we want to move up one level from the data directory, we could use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd ..</code>.  But
there is another way to move to any directory, regardless of your
current location.</p>

<p>So far, when specifying directory names, or even a directory path (as above),
we have been using <strong>relative paths</strong>.  When you use a relative path with a command
like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>, it tries to find that location from where we are,
rather than from the root of the file system.</p>

<p>However, it is possible to specify the <strong>absolute path</strong> to a directory by
including its entire path from the root directory, which is indicated by a
leading slash. The leading <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> tells the computer to follow the path from
the root of the file system, so it always refers to exactly one directory,
no matter where we are when we run the command.</p>

<p>This allows us to move to our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shell-lesson-data</code> directory from anywhere on
the filesystem (including from inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code>). To find the absolute path
we’re looking for, we can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> and then extract the piece we need
to move to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shell-lesson-data</code>.</p>

<blockquote class="code-in">
  <div class="box-title code-in-title" id="code-in-bash-12"><i class="far fa-keyboard" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Input: Bash</div>
  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ pwd
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="code-out">
  <div class="box-title code-out-title" id="code-out-9"><i class="fas fa-laptop-code" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Output</div>
  <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/Users/nelle/
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>Then we could run something like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cd /Users/nelle/shell-lesson-data
</code></pre></div></div>

  <p>The shell interprets a tilde (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code>) character at the start of a path to
mean “the current user’s home directory”. For example, if Nelle’s home
directory is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users/nelle</code>, then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/data</code> is equivalent to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users/nelle/data</code>. This only works if it is the first character in the
path: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">here/there/~/elsewhere</code> is <em>not</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">here/there/Users/nelle/elsewhere</code>.</p>

  <p>Another shortcut is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> (dash) character. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> will translate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> into
<em>the previous directory I was in</em>, which is faster than having to remember,
then type, the full path.  This is a <em>very</em> efficient way of moving
<em>back and forth between two directories</em> – i.e. if you execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd -</code> twice,
you end up back in the starting directory.</p>

  <p>The difference between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd ..</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd -</code> is
that the former brings you <em>up</em>, while the latter brings you <em>back</em>.</p>

<h2 id="general-syntax-of-a-shell-command">General Syntax of a Shell Command</h2>
<p>We have now encountered commands, options, and arguments,
but it is perhaps useful to formalise some terminology.</p>

<p>Consider the command below as a general example of a command,
which we will dissect into its component parts:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ls -F ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> is the <strong>command</strong>, with an <strong>option</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-F</code> and an
<strong>argument</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>.
We’ve already encountered options (also called <strong>switches</strong> or <strong>flags</strong>) which
either start with a single dash (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code>) or two dashes (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--</code>),
and they change the behavior of a command.
<a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/reference.html#argument">Arguments</a> tell the command what to operate on (e.g. files and directories).
Sometimes options and arguments are referred to as <strong>parameters</strong>.
A command can be called with more than one option and more than one argument, but a
command doesn’t always require an argument or an option.</p>

<p>Each part is separated by spaces: if you omit the space
between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-F</code> the shell will look for a command called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls-F</code>, which
doesn’t exist. Also, capitalization can be important.
For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -s</code> will display the size of files and directories alongside the names,
while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -S</code> will sort the files and directories by size, as shown below:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ls -s Desktop/shell-lesson-data/data
total 116
 4 amino-acids.txt   4 animals.txt   4 morse.txt  12 planets.txt  76 sunspot.txt
 4 animal-counts     4 elements      4 pdb         4 salmon.txt
$ ls -S Desktop/shell-lesson-data/data
sunspot.txt  animal-counts  pdb        amino-acids.txt  salmon.txt
planets.txt  elements       morse.txt  animals.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Putting all that together, our command above gives us a listing
of files and directories in our shell-lesson-data folder.</p>

<h3 id="nelles-pipeline-organizing-files">Nelle’s Pipeline: Organizing Files</h3>

<p>Knowing this much about files and directories,
Nelle is ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.
First,
she creates a directory called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">north-pacific-gyre</code>
(to remind herself where the data came from).
Inside that,
she creates a directory called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2012-07-03</code>,
which is the date she started processing the samples.
She used to use names like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">conference-paper</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">revised-results</code>,
but she found them hard to understand after a couple of years.
(The final straw was when she found herself creating
a directory called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">revised-revised-results-3</code>.)</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <div class="box-title tip-title" id="tip-sorting-output-1"><button class="gtn-boxify-button tip" type="button" aria-controls="tip-sorting-output-1" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Tip: Sorting Output</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p>Nelle names her directories ‘year-month-day’,
with leading zeroes for months and days,
because the shell displays file and directory names in alphabetical order.
If she used month names,
December would come before July;
if she didn’t use leading zeroes,
November (‘11’) would come before July (‘7’). Similarly, putting the year first
means that June 2012 will come before June 2013.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each of her physical samples is labelled according to her lab’s convention
with a unique ten-character ID,
such as ‘NENE01729A’.
This ID is what she used in her collection log
to record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample,
so she decides to use it as part of each data file’s name.
Since the assay machine’s output is plain text,
she will call her files <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NENE01729A.txt</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NENE01812A.txt</code>, and so on.
All 1520 files will go into the same directory.</p>

<p>Now in her current directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shell-lesson-data</code>,
Nelle can see what files she has using the command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls </span>north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This command is a lot to type,
but she can let the shell do most of the work through what is called <strong>tab completion</strong>.
If she types:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls </span>nor
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and then presses <kbd>Tab</kbd> (the tab key on her keyboard),
the shell automatically completes the directory name for her:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">ls </span>north-pacific-gyre/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If she presses <kbd>Tab</kbd> again,
Bash will add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2012-07-03/</code> to the command,
since it’s the only possible completion.
Pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> again does nothing,
since there are 19 possibilities;
pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> twice brings up a list of all the files,
and so on.
This is called <strong>tab completion</strong>,
and we will see it in many other tools as we go on.</p>

<h1 id="working-with-files-and-directories">Working with Files and Directories</h1>

<p>We now know how to explore files and directories,
but how do we create them in the first place?</p>

<h2 id="step-one-see-where-we-are-and-what-we-already-have">Step one: see where we are and what we already have</h2>

<p>Let’s go back to our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shell-lesson-data</code> directory on the Desktop
and use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -F</code> to see what it contains:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">pwd</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls</span> <span class="nt">-F</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You should see folders like the following, if not, you’re in the wrong place!</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>creatures/  data/  molecules/  north-pacific-gyre/  notes.txt  pizza.cfg  solar.pdf  writing/
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="create-a-directory">Create a directory</h2>

<p>Let’s create a new directory called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thesis</code> using the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir thesis</code>
(which has no output):</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">mkdir </span>thesis
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you might guess from its name,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code> means ‘make directory’.
Since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thesis</code> is a relative path
(i.e., does not have a leading slash, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/what/ever/thesis</code>),
the new directory is created in the current working directory:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls</span> <span class="nt">-F</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since we’ve just created the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thesis</code> directory, there’s nothing in it yet:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls</span> <span class="nt">-F</span> thesis
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code> is not limited to creating single directories one at a time.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-p</code> option allows <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code> to create a directory with nested subdirectories
in a single operation:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> project/data project/results
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-R</code> option to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command will list all nested subdirectories within a directory.
Let’s use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -FR</code> to recursively list the new directory hierarchy we just created in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">project</code> directory:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls</span> <span class="nt">-FR</span> project
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It should look like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>project/:
data/  results/

project/data:

project/results:
</code></pre></div></div>

  <p>Complicated names of files and directories can make your life painful
when working on the command line. Here we provide a few useful
tips for the names of your files and directories.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Don’t use spaces.</p>

      <p>Spaces can make a name more meaningful,
but since spaces are used to separate arguments on the command line
it is better to avoid them in names of files and directories.
You can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_</code> instead (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">north-pacific-gyre/</code> rather than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">north pacific gyre/</code>).
To test this out, try typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir north pacific gyre</code>and see what directory (or directories!)
are made when you check with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -F</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Don’t begin the name with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> (dash).</p>

      <p>Commands treat names starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> as options.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Stick with letters, numbers, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code> (period or ‘full stop’), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> (dash) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_</code> (underscore).</p>

      <p>Many other characters have special meanings on the command line.
We will learn about some of these during this lesson.
There are special characters that can cause your command to not work as
expected and can even result in data loss.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>If you need to refer to names of files or directories that have spaces
or other special characters, you should surround the name in quotes (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">""</code>).</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-text-file">Creating a text file</h2>

<p>Let’s change our working directory to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thesis</code> using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>,

  <p>Nano is an interactive, full screen editor. You’ll need to switch to a proper

  <p>When we say, “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code> is a text editor” we really do mean “text”: it can
only work with plain character data, not tables, images, or any other
human-friendly media. We use it in examples because it is one of the
least complex text editors. However, because of this trait, it may
not be powerful enough or flexible enough for the work you need to do
after this workshop. On Unix systems (such as Linux and macOS),
many programmers use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> or
<a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> (both of which require more time to learn),
or a graphical editor such as
<a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/">Gedit</a>. On Windows, you may wish to
use <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>.  Windows also has a built-in
editor called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notepad</code> that can be run from the command line in the same
way as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code> for the purposes of this lesson.</p>

  <p>No matter what editor you use, you will need to know where it searches
for and saves files. If you start it from the shell, it will (probably)
use your current working directory as its default location. If you use
your computer’s start menu, it may want to save files in your desktop or
documents directory instead. You can change this by navigating to
another directory the first time you “Save As…”</p>

  <p>You may have noticed that all of Nelle’s files are named ‘something dot
something’, and in this part of the lesson, we always used the extension
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.txt</code>.  This is just a convention: we can call a file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mythesis</code> or
almost anything else we want. However, most people use two-part names
most of the time to help them (and their programs) tell different kinds
of files apart. The second part of such a name is called the
<strong>filename extension</strong> and indicates
what type of data the file holds: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.txt</code> signals a plain text file, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pdf</code>
indicates a PDF document, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.cfg</code> is a configuration file full of parameters
for some program or other, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.png</code> is a PNG image, and so on.</p>

  <p>This is <em>just a convention</em>, albeit an important one. Files contain
bytes: it’s up to us and our programs to interpret those bytes
according to the rules for plain text files, PDF documents, configuration
files, images, and so on.</p>

  <p>Naming a PNG image of a whale as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">whale.mp3</code> doesn’t somehow
magically turn it into a recording of whale song, though it <em>might</em>
cause the operating system to try to open it with a music player
when someone double-clicks it.</p>

<h2 id="moving-files-and-directories">Moving files and directories</h2>
<p>Returning to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shell-lesson-data</code> directory,</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thesis</code> directory we have a file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">draft.txt</code>
which isn’t a particularly informative name,
so let’s change the file’s name using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv</code>,
which is short for ‘move’:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">mv </span>thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first argument tells <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv</code> what we’re ‘moving’,
while the second is where it’s to go.
In this case,
we’re moving <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thesis/draft.txt</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thesis/quotes.txt</code>,
which has the same effect as renaming the file.
Sure enough,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> shows us that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thesis</code> now contains one file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">quotes.txt</code>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls </span>thesis
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One must be careful when specifying the target file name, since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv</code> will
silently overwrite any existing file with the same name, which could
lead to data loss. An additional option, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv -i</code> (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv --interactive</code>),
can be used to make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv</code> ask you for confirmation before overwriting.</p>

<p>Note that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv</code> also works on directories.</p>

<p>Let’s move <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">quotes.txt</code> into the current working directory.
We use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv</code> once again,
but this time we’ll use just the name of a directory as the second argument
to tell <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv</code> that we want to keep the filename
but put the file somewhere new.
(This is why the command is called ‘move’.)
In this case,
the directory name we use is the special directory name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code> that we mentioned earlier.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">mv </span>thesis/quotes.txt <span class="nb">.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The effect is to move the file from the directory it was in to the current working directory.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> now shows us that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thesis</code> is empty:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls </span>thesis
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alternatively, we can confirm the file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">quotes.txt</code> is no longer present in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thesis</code> directory
by explicitly trying to list it:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls </span>thesis/quotes.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> with a filename or directory as an argument only lists the requested file or directory.
If the file given as the argument doesn’t exist, the shell returns an error as we saw above.
We can use this to see that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">quotes.txt</code> is now present in our current directory:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls </span>quotes.txt

<h2 id="copying-files-and-directories">Copying files and directories</h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp</code> command works very much like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv</code>,
except it copies a file instead of moving it.
We can check that it did the right thing using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>
with two paths as arguments — like most Unix commands,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> can be given multiple paths at once:</p>

<p>We can also copy a directory and all its contents by using the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion">recursive</a> option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-r</code>,
e.g. to back up a directory:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cp</span> <span class="nt">-r</span> thesis thesis_backup

<blockquote class="tip">
  <div class="box-title tip-title" id="tip-wildcards-1"><button class="gtn-boxify-button tip" type="button" aria-controls="tip-wildcards-1" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Tip: Wildcards</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> is a <strong>wildcard</strong>, which matches zero or more  characters.
Let’s consider the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shell-lesson-data/molecules</code> directory:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.pdb</code> matches <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ethane.pdb</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">propane.pdb</code>, and every
file that ends with ‘.pdb’. On the other hand, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p*.pdb</code> only matches
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pentane.pdb</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">propane.pdb</code>, because the ‘p’ at the front only
matches filenames that begin with the letter ‘p’.</p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code> is also a wildcard, but it matches exactly one character.
So <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?ethane.pdb</code> would match <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">methane.pdb</code> whereas
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*ethane.pdb</code> matches both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ethane.pdb</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">methane.pdb</code>.</p>

  <p>Wildcards can be used in combination with each other
e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">???ane.pdb</code> matches three characters followed by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ane.pdb</code>,
giving <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  octane.pdb</code>.</p>

  <p>When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a
list of matching filenames <em>before</em> running the command that was
asked for. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match
any file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command
as it is. For example, typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls *.pdf</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">molecules</code> directory
(which contains only files with names ending with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pdb</code>) results in
an error message that there is no file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.pdf</code>.
However, generally commands like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wc</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> see the lists of
file names matching these expressions, but not the wildcards
themselves. It is the shell, not the other programs, that deals with
expanding wildcards.</p>

    <p>The solution is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.</code></p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.</code> shows all files whose names contain zero or more characters (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code>)
followed by the letter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t</code>,
then zero or more characters (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code>) followed by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ane.pdb</code>.
This gives <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb</code>.</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2.</code> shows all files whose names start with zero or more characters (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code>) followed by
the letter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t</code>,
then a single character (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code>), then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ne.</code> followed by zero or more characters (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code>).
This will give us <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">octane.pdb</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pentane.pdb</code> but doesn’t match anything
which ends in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thane.pdb</code>.</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.</code> fixes the problems of option 2 by matching two characters (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">??</code>) between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ne</code>.
This is the solution.</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4.</code> only shows files starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ethane.</code>.</p>

<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">processed</code> that contain data files.  The goal is to copy the folder structure
of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2016-05-18-data</code> folder into a folder called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2016-05-20</code>
so that your final directory structure looks like this:</p>

└── data
   ├── processed
   └── raw
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>Which of the following set of commands would achieve this objective?
What would the other commands do?</p>

    <p>The first two sets of commands achieve this objective.
The first set uses relative paths to create the top-level directory before
the subdirectories.</p>

    <p>The third set of commands will give an error because the default behavior of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code>
won’t create a subdirectory of a non-existent directory:
the intermediate level folders must be created first.</p>

    <p>The fourth set of commands achieve this objective. Remember, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-p</code> option,
followed by a path of one or more
directories, will cause <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code> to create any intermediate subdirectories as required.</p>

    <p>The final set of commands generates the ‘raw’ and ‘processed’ directories at the same level
as the ‘data’ directory.</p>
