time_estimation: 1H
key_points:
- A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs.
- This lesson uses Bash, the default shell in many implementations of Unix.
- Programs can be run in Bash by entering commands at the command-line prompt.
- The shell's main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio, its support for automating repetitive tasks, and its capacity to access networked machines.
- The shell's main disadvantages are its primarily textual nature and how cryptic its commands and operation can be.
- "The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk."
- "Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders)."
- "Directories can also store other directories, which then form a directory tree."
- "`cd [path]` changes the current working directory."
- "`ls [path]` prints a listing of a specific file or directory; `ls` on its own lists the current working directory."
- "`pwd` prints the user's current working directory."
- "`/` on its own is the root directory of the whole file system."
- "Most commands take options (flags) that begin with a `-`."
- "A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location."
- "An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system."
- "Directory names in a path are separated with `/` on Unix, but `\\` on Windows."
- "`..` means 'the directory above the current one'; `.` on its own means 'the current directory'."
- "`cp [old] [new]` copies a file."
- "`mkdir [path]` creates a new directory."
- "`mv [old] [new]` moves (renames) a file or directory."
- "`rm [path]` removes (deletes) a file."
- "`*` matches zero or more characters in a filename, so `*.txt` matches all files ending in `.txt`."
- "`?` matches any single character in a filename, so `?.txt` matches `a.txt` but not `any.txt`."
- "Use of the Control key may be described in many ways, including `Ctrl-X`, `Control-X`, and `^X`."
- "The shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it's really gone."
- "Most files' names are `something.extension`. The extension isn't required, and doesn't guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file."
- "Depending on the type of work you do, you may need a more powerful text editor than Nano."

# Background


Humans and computers commonly interact in many different ways, such as through a keyboard and mouse,
touch screen interfaces, or using speech recognition systems.
The most widely used way to interact with personal computers is called a
**graphical user interface** (GUI).
With a GUI, we give instructions by clicking a mouse and using menu-driven interactions.

While the visual aid of a GUI makes it intuitive to learn,
this way of delivering instructions to a computer scales very poorly.
Imagine the following task:
for a literature search, you have to copy the third line of one thousand text files in one thousand
different directories and paste it into a single file.
Using a GUI, you would not only be clicking at your desk for several hours,
but you could potentially also commit an error in the process of completing this repetitive task.
This is where we take advantage of the Unix shell.
The Unix shell is both a **command-line interface** (CLI) and a scripting language,
allowing such repetitive tasks to be done automatically and fast.
With the proper commands, the shell can repeat tasks with or without some modification
as many times as we want.
Using the shell, the task in the literature example can be accomplished in seconds.

## Setup

Before we do anything, we'll get you setup with some test data which can help
guide your exploration of the CLI.

```bash
cd ~/
mkdir -p Desktop/
cd Desktop/
wget -c https://github.com/swcarpentry/shell-novice/raw/2929ba2cbb1bcb5ff0d1b4100c6e58b96e155fd1/data/shell-lesson-data.zip
unzip -u shell-lesson-data.zip
```


## The Shell

The shell is a program where users can type commands.
With the shell, it's possible to invoke complicated programs like climate modeling software
or simple commands that create an empty directory with only one line of code.
The most popular Unix shell is Bash (the Bourne Again SHell ---
so-called because it's derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne).
Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix and in most packages that provide
Unix-like tools for Windows.

Using the shell will take some effort and some time to learn.
While a GUI presents you with choices to select, CLI choices are not automatically presented to you,
so you must learn a few commands like new vocabulary in a language you're studying.
However, unlike a spoken language, a small number of "words" (i.e. commands) gets you a long way,
and we'll cover those essential few today.

The grammar of a shell allows you to combine existing tools into powerful
pipelines and handle large volumes of data automatically. Sequences of
commands can be written into a *script*, improving the reproducibility of
workflows.

In addition, the command line is often the easiest way to interact with remote machines
and supercomputers.
Familiarity with the shell is near essential to run a variety of specialized tools and resources
including high-performance computing systems.
As clusters and cloud computing systems become more popular for scientific data crunching,
being able to interact with the shell is becoming a necessary skill.
We can build on the command-line skills covered here
to tackle a wide range of scientific questions and computational challenges.

Let's get started.

When the shell is first opened, you are presented with a **prompt**,
indicating that the shell is waiting for input.

```
$
```

The shell typically uses `$ ` as the prompt, but may use a different symbol.
In the examples for this lesson, we will **not** include this prompt!

Most importantly:
when typing commands, either from these lessons or from other sources,
*do not type the prompt*, only the commands that follow it.
Also note that after you type a command, you have to press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to execute it.

The prompt is followed by a **text cursor**, a character that indicates the position where your
typing will appear.
The cursor is usually a flashing or solid block, but it can also be an underscore or a pipe.
You may have seen it in a text editor program, for example.

So let's try our first command, `ls` which is short for listing.

## Nelle's Pipeline: A Typical Problem

Nelle Nemo, a marine biologist,
has just returned from a six-month survey of the
[North Pacific Gyre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific_Gyre),
where she has been sampling gelatinous marine life in the
[Great Pacific Garbage Patch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch).
She has 1520 samples that she's run through an assay machine to measure the relative abundance
of 300 proteins.
She needs to run these 1520 files through an imaginary program called `goostats.sh` she inherited.
On top of this huge task, she has to write up results by the end of the month so her paper
can appear in a special issue of *Aquatic Goo Letters*.

The bad news is that if she has to run `goostats.sh` by hand using a GUI,
she'll have to select and open a file 1520 times.
If `goostats.sh` takes 30 seconds to run each file, the whole process will take more than 12 hours
of Nelle's attention.
With the shell, Nelle can instead assign her computer this mundane task while she focuses
her attention on writing her paper.

The next few lessons will explore the ways Nelle can achieve this.
More specifically,
they explain how she can use a command shell to run the `goostats.sh` program,
using loops to automate the repetitive steps of entering file names,
so that her computer can work while she writes her paper.

As a bonus,
once she has put a processing pipeline together,
she will be able to use it again whenever she collects more data.

In order to achieve her task, Nelle needs to know how to:
- navigate to a file/directory
- create a file/directory
- check the length of a file
- chain commands together
- retrieve a set of files
- iterate over files
- run a shell script containing her pipeline

# Navigating Files and Directories

The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories
is called the **file system**.
It organizes our data into files,
which hold information,
and directories (also called 'folders'),
which hold files or other directories.

Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.
To start exploring them, we'll go to our open shell window.

First, let's find out where we are by running a command called `pwd`
(which stands for 'print working directory'). Directories are like *places*, at any time
while we are using the shell, we are in exactly one place called
our **current working directory**. Commands mostly read and write files in the
current working directory, i.e. 'here', so knowing where you are before running
a command is important. `pwd` shows you where you are:

```bash
pwd
```

Try running it now.

To understand what a 'home directory' is,
let's have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized.  For the
sake of this example, we'll be
illustrating the filesystem on our scientist Nelle's computer.  After this
illustration, you'll be learning commands to explore your own filesystem,
which will be constructed in a similar way, but not be exactly identical.

On Nelle's computer, the filesystem looks like this:

![The file system is made up of a root directory that contains sub-directories titled bin, data, users, and tmp](../../images/carpentries-cli/filesystem.svg)

At the top is the **root directory**
that holds everything else.
We refer to it using a slash character, `/`, on its own;
this character is the leading slash in `/Users/nelle`.

Inside that directory are several other directories:
`bin` (which is where some built-in programs are stored),
`data` (for miscellaneous data files),
`Users` (where users' personal directories are located),
`tmp` (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term),
and so on.

We know that our current working directory `/Users/nelle` is stored inside `/Users`
because `/Users` is the first part of its name.
Similarly,
we know that `/Users` is stored inside the root directory `/`
because its name begins with `/`.

> <tip-title>Slashes</tip-title>
>
> Notice that there are two meanings for the `/` character.
> When it appears at the front of a file or directory name,
> it refers to the root directory. When it appears *inside* a path,
> it's just a separator.
{: .tip}

Underneath `/Users`,
we find one directory for each user with an account on Nelle's machine,
her colleagues *imhotep* and *larry*.

![Like other directories, home directories are sub-directories underneath '/Users' like '/Users/imhotep', '/Users/larry' or '/Users/nelle'](../../images/carpentries-cli/home-directories.svg)

The user *imhotep*'s files are stored in `/Users/imhotep`,
user *larry*'s in `/Users/larry`,
and Nelle's in `/Users/nelle`.  Because Nelle is the user in our
examples here, therefore we get `/Users/nelle` as our home directory.
Typically, when you open a new command prompt, you will be in
your home directory to start.

Now let's learn the command that will let us see the contents of our
own filesystem.  We can see what's in our home directory by running `ls`:

```bash
ls
```

`ls` prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory.
We can make its output more comprehensible by using the `-F` **option**
(also known as a **switch** or a **flag**),
which tells `ls` to classify the output
by adding a marker to file and directory names to indicate what they are:
- a trailing `/` indicates that this is a directory
- `@` indicates a link
- `*` indicates an executable

Depending on your default options,
the shell might also use colors to indicate whether each entry is a file or
directory.

```bash
ls -F
```

Here,
we can see that our home directory contains only **sub-directories**.
Any names in our output that don't have a classification symbol
are plain old **files**.

### Getting help

`ls` has lots of other **options**. There are two common ways to find out how
to use a command and what options it accepts:

1. We can pass a `--help` option to the command,
2. We can read its manual with `man`

#### The `--help` option

Many bash commands, and programs that people have written that can be
run from within bash, support a `--help` option to display more
information on how to use the command or program.

```bash
ls --help
```

> <tip-title>Unsupported command-line options</tip-title>
> If you try to use an option (flag) that is not supported, `ls` and other commands

> > ```
> > ls: invalid option -- 'j'

#### The `man` command

The other way to learn about `ls` is to type

> ```
> $ man ls
> ```
{: .code-in}

> <code-out-title></code-out-title>

This command will turn your terminal into a page with a description
of the `ls` command and its options.

To navigate through the `man` pages,
you may use <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> to move line-by-line,
or try <kbd>B</kbd> and <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> to skip up and down by a full page.
To search for a character or word in the `man` pages,
use <kbd>/</kbd> followed by the character or word you are searching for.
Sometimes a search will result in multiple hits.
If so, you can move between hits using <kbd>N</kbd> (for moving forward) and
<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> (for moving backward).

To **quit** the `man` pages, press <kbd>Q</kbd>.

### Exploring Other Directories

Not only can we use `ls` on the current working directory,
but we can use it to list the contents of a different directory.
Let's take a look at our current directory by running `ls -F ~/`,
i.e.,
the command `ls` with the `-F` **option** and the [**argument**][Arguments]  `/`.
The argument `~/` tells `ls` that
we want a listing of something other than our current working directory:

```bash
ls -F ~/
```

As you may now see, using a bash shell is strongly dependent on the idea that
your files are organized in a hierarchical file system.
Organizing things hierarchically in this way helps us keep track of our work:
it's possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory,
just as it's possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk,
but it's a self-defeating strategy.

Now that we know the `shell-lesson-data` directory is located in current working directory, we
can do two things.

First, we can look at its contents, using the same strategy as before, passing
a directory name to `ls`:

```bash
ls -F shell-lesson-data
```

Second, we can actually change our location to a different directory, so
we are no longer located in
our home directory.

The command to change locations is `cd` followed by a
directory name to change our working directory.
`cd` stands for 'change directory',
which is a bit misleading:
the command doesn't change the directory;
it changes the shell's idea of what directory we are in.
The `cd` command is akin to double clicking a folder in a graphical interface to get into a folder.

Let's say we want to move to the `data` directory we saw above. We can
use the following series of commands to get there:

```bash
cd shell-lesson-data
```

These commands will move us into
the `shell-lesson-data` directory, then into the `data` directory.
You will notice that `cd` doesn't print anything. This is normal.
Many shell commands will not output anything to the screen when successfully executed.
But if we run `pwd` after it, we can see that we are now
in `/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/data`.
If we run `ls -F` without arguments now,
it lists the contents of `/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/data`,
because that's where we now are:

```bash
pwd
```

```bash
ls -F data/
```

We now know how to go down the directory tree (i.e. how to go into a subdirectory),
but how do we go up (i.e. how do we leave a directory and go into its parent directory)?
We might try the following:

```bash
cd shell-lesson-data
```

But we get an error! Why is this?

With our methods so far,
`cd` can only see sub-directories inside your current directory. There are
different ways to see directories above your current location; we'll start
with the simplest.

There is a shortcut in the shell to move up one directory level
that looks like this:

```bash
cd ..
```

`..` is a special directory name meaning
"the directory containing this one",
or more succinctly,
the **parent** of the current directory.
Sure enough,
if we run `pwd` after running `cd ..`, we're back in `/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data`:

```bash
pwd
```

The special directory `..` doesn't usually show up when we run `ls`. If we want
to display it, we can add the `-a` option to `ls -F`:

```bash
ls -F -a
```

`-a` stands for 'show all';
it forces `ls` to show us file and directory names that begin with `.`,
such as `..` (which, if we're in `/Users/nelle`, refers to the `/Users` directory).
As you can see,
it also displays another special directory that's just called `.`,
which means 'the current working directory'.
It may seem redundant to have a name for it,
but we'll see some uses for it soon.

Note that in most command line tools, multiple options can be combined
with a single `-` and no spaces between the options: `ls -F -a` is
equivalent to `ls -Fa`.

{: .tip}

These three commands are the basic commands for navigating the filesystem on your computer:
`pwd`, `ls`, and `cd`. Let's explore some variations on those commands. What happens
if you type `cd` on its own, without giving
a directory?

```bash
cd
```

How can you check what happened? `pwd` gives us the answer!

```bash
pwd
```

It turns out that `cd` without an argument will return you to your home directory,
which is great if you've gotten lost in your own filesystem.

Let's try returning to the `data` directory from before. Last time, we used
three commands, but we can actually string together the list of directories
to move to `data` in one step:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/data
```

Check that we've moved to the right place by running `pwd` and `ls -F`.

If we want to move up one level from the data directory, we could use `cd ..`.  But
there is another way to move to any directory, regardless of your
current location.

So far, when specifying directory names, or even a directory path (as above),
we have been using **relative paths**.  When you use a relative path with a command
like `ls` or `cd`, it tries to find that location from where we are,
rather than from the root of the file system.

However, it is possible to specify the **absolute path** to a directory by
including its entire path from the root directory, which is indicated by a
leading slash. The leading `/` tells the computer to follow the path from
the root of the file system, so it always refers to exactly one directory,
no matter where we are when we run the command.

This allows us to move to our `shell-lesson-data` directory from anywhere on
the filesystem (including from inside `data`). To find the absolute path
we're looking for, we can use `pwd` and then extract the piece we need
to move to `shell-lesson-data`.

> <code-in-title>Bash</code-in-title>
> ```
> $ pwd
> ```
{: .code-in}

> <code-out-title></code-out-title>
> ```bash
> /Users/nelle/
> ```
{: .code-out}

Then we could run something like:

```
$ cd /Users/nelle/shell-lesson-data
```

Run `pwd` and `ls -F` to ensure that we're in the directory we expect. If we're not, edit the command block below to make sure we're in the correct location (`~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/`)

```
pwd
ls -F
```

First navigate to `~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data` (you should already be there).

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data
```

Then `cd` into the `creatures` directory
```bash
cd creatures
```

Now if you run
```bash
cd -
```
you'll see you're back in `~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data`.
Run `cd -` again and you're back in `~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/creatures`

## General Syntax of a Shell Command
We have now encountered commands, options, and arguments,
but it is perhaps useful to formalise some terminology.

Consider the command below as a general example of a command,
which we will dissect into its component parts:

```
$ ls -F ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/
```

`ls` is the **command**, with an **option** `-F` and an
**argument** `/`.
We've already encountered options (also called **switches** or **flags**) which
either start with a single dash (`-`) or two dashes (`--`),
and they change the behavior of a command.
[Arguments] tell the command what to operate on (e.g. files and directories).
Sometimes options and arguments are referred to as **parameters**.
A command can be called with more than one option and more than one argument, but a
command doesn't always require an argument or an option.

Each part is separated by spaces: if you omit the space
between `ls` and `-F` the shell will look for a command called `ls-F`, which
doesn't exist. Also, capitalization can be important.
For example, `ls -s` will display the size of files and directories alongside the names,
while `ls -S` will sort the files and directories by size, as shown below:

```
$ ls -s Desktop/shell-lesson-data/data
total 116
 4 amino-acids.txt   4 animals.txt   4 morse.txt  12 planets.txt  76 sunspot.txt
 4 animal-counts     4 elements      4 pdb         4 salmon.txt
$ ls -S Desktop/shell-lesson-data/data
sunspot.txt  animal-counts  pdb        amino-acids.txt  salmon.txt
planets.txt  elements       morse.txt  animals.txt
```

Putting all that together, our command above gives us a listing
of files and directories in our shell-lesson-data folder.


### Nelle's Pipeline: Organizing Files

Knowing this much about files and directories,
Nelle is ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.
First,
she creates a directory called `north-pacific-gyre`
(to remind herself where the data came from).
Inside that,
she creates a directory called `2012-07-03`,
which is the date she started processing the samples.
She used to use names like `conference-paper` and `revised-results`,
but she found them hard to understand after a couple of years.
(The final straw was when she found herself creating
a directory called `revised-revised-results-3`.)

> <tip-title>Sorting Output</tip-title>
>
> Nelle names her directories 'year-month-day',
> with leading zeroes for months and days,
> because the shell displays file and directory names in alphabetical order.
> If she used month names,
> December would come before July;
> if she didn't use leading zeroes,
> November ('11') would come before July ('7'). Similarly, putting the year first
> means that June 2012 will come before June 2013.
{: .tip}

Each of her physical samples is labelled according to her lab's convention
with a unique ten-character ID,
such as 'NENE01729A'.
This ID is what she used in her collection log
to record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample,
so she decides to use it as part of each data file's name.
Since the assay machine's output is plain text,
she will call her files `NENE01729A.txt`, `NENE01812A.txt`, and so on.
All 1520 files will go into the same directory.

Now in her current directory `shell-lesson-data`,
Nelle can see what files she has using the command:

```bash
ls north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/
```

This command is a lot to type,
but she can let the shell do most of the work through what is called **tab completion**.
If she types:

```bash
ls nor
```

and then presses <kbd>Tab</kbd> (the tab key on her keyboard),
the shell automatically completes the directory name for her:

```
$ ls north-pacific-gyre/
```
{: .language-bash}

If she presses <kbd>Tab</kbd> again,
Bash will add `2012-07-03/` to the command,
since it's the only possible completion.
Pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> again does nothing,
since there are 19 possibilities;
pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> twice brings up a list of all the files,
and so on.
This is called **tab completion**,
and we will see it in many other tools as we go on.


# Working with Files and Directories

We now know how to explore files and directories,
but how do we create them in the first place?

## Step one: see where we are and what we already have

Let's go back to our `shell-lesson-data` directory on the Desktop
and use `ls -F` to see what it contains:

```bash
pwd
```

```bash
ls -F
```

You should see folders like the following, if not, you're in the wrong place!

```
creatures/  data/  molecules/  north-pacific-gyre/  notes.txt  pizza.cfg  solar.pdf  writing/
```

## Create a directory

Let's create a new directory called `thesis` using the command `mkdir thesis`
(which has no output):

```bash
mkdir thesis
```

As you might guess from its name,
`mkdir` means 'make directory'.
Since `thesis` is a relative path
(i.e., does not have a leading slash, like `/what/ever/thesis`),
the new directory is created in the current working directory:

```bash
ls -F
```

Since we've just created the `thesis` directory, there's nothing in it yet:

```bash
ls -F thesis
```

Note that `mkdir` is not limited to creating single directories one at a time.
The `-p` option allows `mkdir` to create a directory with nested subdirectories
in a single operation:

```bash
mkdir -p project/data project/results
```

The `-R` option to the `ls` command will list all nested subdirectories within a directory.
Let's use `ls -FR` to recursively list the new directory hierarchy we just created in the
`project` directory:

```bash
ls -FR project
```

It should look like:

```
project/:
data/  results/

project/data:

project/results:
```

## Creating a text file

Let's change our working directory to `thesis` using `cd`,
then run a text editor called Nano to create a file called `draft.txt`:

```
$ cd thesis
$ nano draft.txt
```

> <warning-title>Nano won't work in a Jupyter Notebook!</warning-title>

{: .tip}

Let's type in a few lines of text.
Once we're happy with our text, we can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>
(press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Control</kbd> key and, while
holding it down, press the <kbd>O</kbd> key) to write our data to disk
(we'll be asked what file we want to save this to:
press <kbd>Return</kbd> to accept the suggested default of `draft.txt`).

![screenshot of nano text editor in action](../../images/carpentries-cli/nano-screenshot.png)

Once our file is saved, we can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> to quit the editor and
return to the shell.

`nano` doesn't leave any output on the screen after it exits,
but `ls` now shows that we have created a file called `draft.txt`:

## Moving files and directories
Returning to the `shell-lesson-data` directory,

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/
```

In our `thesis` directory we have a file `draft.txt`
which isn't a particularly informative name,
so let's change the file's name using `mv`,
which is short for 'move':

```bash
mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt
```

The first argument tells `mv` what we're 'moving',
while the second is where it's to go.
In this case,
we're moving `thesis/draft.txt` to `thesis/quotes.txt`,
which has the same effect as renaming the file.
Sure enough,
`ls` shows us that `thesis` now contains one file called `quotes.txt`:

```bash
ls thesis
```

One must be careful when specifying the target file name, since `mv` will
silently overwrite any existing file with the same name, which could
lead to data loss. An additional option, `mv -i` (or `mv --interactive`),
can be used to make `mv` ask you for confirmation before overwriting.

Note that `mv` also works on directories.

Let's move `quotes.txt` into the current working directory.
We use `mv` once again,
but this time we'll use just the name of a directory as the second argument
to tell `mv` that we want to keep the filename
but put the file somewhere new.
(This is why the command is called 'move'.)
In this case,
the directory name we use is the special directory name `.` that we mentioned earlier.

```bash
mv thesis/quotes.txt .
```

The effect is to move the file from the directory it was in to the current working directory.
`ls` now shows us that `thesis` is empty:

```bash
ls thesis
```

Alternatively, we can confirm the file `quotes.txt` is no longer present in the `thesis` directory
by explicitly trying to list it:

```bash
ls thesis/quotes.txt
```

`ls` with a filename or directory as an argument only lists the requested file or directory.
If the file given as the argument doesn't exist, the shell returns an error as we saw above.
We can use this to see that `quotes.txt` is now present in our current directory:

```bash
ls quotes.txt
```

## Copying files and directories

The `cp` command works very much like `mv`,
except it copies a file instead of moving it.
We can check that it did the right thing using `ls`
with two paths as arguments --- like most Unix commands,
`ls` can be given multiple paths at once:

```bash
cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
```

We can also copy a directory and all its contents by using the
[recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) option `-r`,
e.g. to back up a directory:

```bash
cp -r thesis thesis_backup
```

We can check the result by listing the contents of both the `thesis` and `thesis_backup` directory:

```bash
ls thesis thesis_backup
```

## Removing files and directories

Returning to the `shell-lesson-data` directory,
let's tidy up this directory by removing the `quotes.txt` file we created.
The Unix command we'll use for this is `rm` (short for 'remove'):

```bash
rm quotes.txt
```

We can confirm the file has gone using `ls`:

```bash
ls quotes.txt
```

If we try to remove the `thesis` directory using `rm thesis`,
we get an error message:

```bash
rm thesis
```

This happens because `rm` by default only works on files, not directories.

`rm` can remove a directory *and all its contents* if we use the
recursive option `-r`, and it will do so *without any confirmation prompts*:

```bash
rm -r thesis
```

Given that there is no way to retrieve files deleted using the shell,
`rm -r` *should be used with great caution*
(you might consider adding the interactive option `rm -r -i`).

## Operations with multiple files and directories

Oftentimes one needs to copy or move several files at once.
This can be done by providing a list of individual filenames,
or specifying a naming pattern using wildcards.

### Using wildcards for accessing multiple files at once

> <tip-title>Wildcards</tip-title>
>
> `*` is a **wildcard**, which matches zero or more  characters.
> Let's consider the `shell-lesson-data/molecules` directory:
> `*.pdb` matches `ethane.pdb`, `propane.pdb`, and every
> file that ends with '.pdb'. On the other hand, `p*.pdb` only matches
> `pentane.pdb` and `propane.pdb`, because the 'p' at the front only
> matches filenames that begin with the letter 'p'.
>
> `?` is also a wildcard, but it matches exactly one character.
> So `?ethane.pdb` would match `methane.pdb` whereas
> `*ethane.pdb` matches both `ethane.pdb`, and `methane.pdb`.
>
> Wildcards can be used in combination with each other
> e.g. `???ane.pdb` matches three characters followed by `ane.pdb`,
> giving `cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  octane.pdb`.
>
> When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a
> list of matching filenames *before* running the command that was
> asked for. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match
> any file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command
> as it is. For example, typing `ls *.pdf` in the `molecules` directory
> (which contains only files with names ending with `.pdb`) results in
> an error message that there is no file called `*.pdf`.
> However, generally commands like `wc` and `ls` see the lists of
> file names matching these expressions, but not the wildcards
> themselves. It is the shell, not the other programs, that deals with
> expanding wildcards.
