# Background

- Need: digitally store biological data
- All biological data could be (and initially was) included in simple text files
- Yet, significant limitations:
    - Not structured, hence not programmatically accessible
    - Impossible to distinguish data (e.g. gene sequence) from metadata (e.g. annotations about location, quality, function, etc.)

???

In this presentation, we'll look into the history of biological data.
Initially, all type of data was approached using simple text files, but this quickly became limiting.
Indeed, unstructured text files are not programmatically accessible and in such files it is impossible to distinguish data from metadata.
It's important to understand these limitations as they set the stage for the development of more advanced storage methods.

---

## Different information in different file formats

- In the years, different file formats have been developed to store different types of data with the relevant metadata fields
- E.g. for a biological sequence
    - From the simplest, text-like file (FASTA)
    - To more complex formats which include genomic features and quality annotation
- Different file formats not only to represent different levels of complexity but also different types of information
- E.g. about a protein
    - From a text-like file to store the sequence (FASTA)
    - To a tabular file to store the exact coordinates of each atom in the structure, hence comvey the 3D arrangement

???

As time progressed, the need for more structured and accessible data storage became apparent.
Various file formats were developed to accommodate different types of biological data.
We'll explore some of these formats, ranging from simple text-like files for storing sequences to more complex ones
that include annotations, 3D structures, and genomic features.

---

## Different information in different databases

- Consequently, different resources evolved not only to store, but also represent/visualise this varied information
- These resources often have a database storing data and a web interface that allows to navigate it
- They usually represent different levels of complexity of one specific type of biological entity
    - E.g. A database of protein sequences and their annotation (sequence variability, genomic location, effect of mutations, etc.)
    - E.g. A database of protein structures and their annotation (3D coordinates, flexibility, methods used to resolve the structure, etc.)

???

In parallel, different biological resources emerged, each designed to handle specific types of data and complexity.
These resources often consist of databases with associated web interfaces, enabling users to navigate and visualize the data effectively.

---

### Definition of a biological database/resources

- The [NAR Database Issue](https://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/c/) collects publications of established databases in the field
- Collection of data (and metadata) in the related format
    - structured
    - searchable (indexed)
    - updated periodically
    - entries mapped to unique identifiers, and cross-referenced
- Includes associated software necessary for DB access, update, search, visualisation (web)

???

Biological databases play a crucial role in housing and organizing biological data.
The NAR Database Issue collects publications about established databases in the field.
Requirements to be featured in this issues are to have a structured nature, searchability, regular updates, and cross-referencing capabilities.
These databases also offer software tools for accessing, updating, and visualizing the data they contain.

# Biological file formats

- Sequence formats
- Alignment formats
- Features/annotations formats
- Structure formats

???

In the following tutorials, we'll explore some of the most commonly used biological file formats in detail.
We'll provide examples and explanations for each format, helping you understand how they store and represent different types of biological data.


---

## Sequence formats

**FASTA**

File extensions: file.fa, file.fasta, file.fsa

Example:

```markdown
>XR_002086427.1 Candida albicans SC5314 uncharacterized ncRNA (SCR1), ncRNA

TGGCTGTGATGGCTTTTAGCGGAAGCGCGCTGTTCGCGTACCTGCTGTTTGTTGAAAATTTAAGAGCAAAGTGTCCGGCTCGATCCCTGCGAATTGAATTCTGAACGCTAGAGTAATCAGTGTCTTTCAAGTTCTGGTAATGTTTAGCATAACCACTGGAGGGAAGCAATTCAGCACAGTAATGCTAATCGTGGTGGAGGCGAATCCGGATGGCACCTTGTTTGTTGATAAATAGTGCGGTATCTAGTGTTGCAACTCTATTTTT
```

???

Fasta format is a simple way of representing nucleotide or amino acid sequences of nucleic acids and proteins.
This is a very basic format with two minimum lines. First line referred as comment line starts with ‘>’ and gives
basic information about sequence. There is no set format for comment line. Any other line that starts with ‘;’ will
be ignored. Lines with ‘;’ are not a common feature of fasta files. After comment line, sequence of nucleic acid or
protein is included in standard one letter code. Any tabulators, spaces, asterisks etc in sequence will be ignored.

---

## Sequence formats

**FASTQ**

File extensions: ile.fastq, file.sanfastq, file.fq

Example:

```markdown
@K00188:208:HFLNGBBXX:3:1101:1428:1508 2:N:0:CTTGTA
ATAATAGGATCCCTTTTCCTGGAGCTGCCTTTAGGTAATGTAGTATCTNATNGACTGNCNCCANANGGCTAAAGT
+
AAAFFJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJFJJFJJJJJFJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ#FJ#JJJJF#F#FJJ#F#JJJFJJJJJ
```

???

Fastq format was developed by Sanger institute in order to group together sequence and its quality scores (Q: phred quality score). In fastq files each entry is associated with 4 lines.

- Line 1 begins with a ‘@‘ character and is a sequence identifier and an optional description.
- Line 2 Sequence in standard one letter code.
- Line 3 begins with a ‘+‘ character and is optionally followed by the same sequence identifier (and any additional description) again.
- Line 4 encodes the quality values for the sequence in Line 2, and must contain the same number of symbols as letters in the sequence.

## Alignment formats

**SAM (Sequence Alignment Map)**

File extensions: file.sam

Example:

```markdown

```

???

The SAM Format is a text format for storing sequence data in a series of tab delimited ASCII columns. Most often it is
generated as a human readable version of its sister BAM format, which stores the same data in a compressed, indexed, binary form.

SAM format files are generated following mapping of the reads to reference sequence. It is TAB-delimited text format
with header and a body. Header lines start with ‘@’ while alignment lines do not. Header hold generic information on
SAM file along with version information, if the file is sorted, information on reference sequence, etc. The alignment
records constitute the body of the file. Each alignment line/record has 11 mandatory fields describing essential alignment information.

---

## Alignment formats

**BAM (Binary Alignment/Map)**

File extensions: file.bam

A BAM file is the compressed binary version of the Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM).

???

a compact and indexable representation of nucleotide sequence alignments. The data between SAM and BAM is exactly
same. Being Binary BAM files are small in size and ideal to store alignment files. Require samtools to view the file.

???

GFF (General Feature Format or Gene Finding Format). GFF can be used for any kind of feature (Transcripts, exon,
intron, promoter, 3’ UTR, repeatitive elements etc) associated with the sequence, whereas GTF is primarily for
genes/transcripts.  GFF3 is the latest version and an improvement over GFF2 format. However, many databases are
still not equipped to handle GFF3 version. The differences will be explained later in text.

The GFF format has 9 mandatory columns and they are TAB separated.
- Col. 1 Reference Sequence
- Col. 2 Source
- Col. 3 Feature
- Col. 4 Start
- Col. 5 End
- Col. 6 Score
- Col. 7 Strand
- Col. 8 Frame (GFF2 and GTF) or Phase (GFF3)
- Col. 9  Attribute or Group field
