<p>For this tutorial we need to download a database that we will use for the queries.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="err">!</span><span class="n">wget</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="n">http</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">swcarpentry</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">github</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">io</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">novice</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">survey</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">files</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">survey</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">db</span>

<h1 id="programming-with-databases---python">Programming with Databases - Python</h1>

<p>Let’s have a look at how to access a database from
a general-purpose programming language like Python.
Other languages use almost exactly the same model:
library and function names may differ,
but the concepts are the same.</p>

<p>Here’s a short Python program that selects latitudes and longitudes
from an SQLite database stored in a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">survey.db</code>:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">sqlite3</span>

<span class="n">connection</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sqlite3</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">connect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">survey.db</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">cursor</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">connection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">cursor</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">cursor</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">execute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">SELECT Site.lat, Site.long FROM Site;</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">results</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cursor</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">fetchall</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">r</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">results</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">r</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">cursor</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">close</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">connection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">close</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The program starts by importing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sqlite3</code> library.
If we were connecting to MySQL, DB2, or some other database,
we would import a different library,
but all of them provide the same functions,
so that the rest of our program does not have to change
(at least, not much)
if we switch from one database to another.</p>

<p>Line 2 establishes a connection to the database.
Since we’re using SQLite,
all we need to specify is the name of the database file.
Other systems may require us to provide a username and password as well.
Line 3 then uses this connection to create a cursor.
Just like the cursor in an editor,
its role is to keep track of where we are in the database.</p>

<p>On line 4, we use that cursor to ask the database to execute a query for us.
The query is written in SQL,
and passed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cursor.execute</code> as a string.
It’s our job to make sure that SQL is properly formatted;
if it isn’t,
or if something goes wrong when it is being executed,
the database will report an error.</p>

<p>The database returns the results of the query to us
in response to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cursor.fetchall</code> call on line 5.
This result is a list with one entry for each record in the result set;
if we loop over that list (line 6) and print those list entries (line 7),
we can see that each one is a tuple
with one element for each field we asked for.</p>

<p>Finally, lines 8 and 9 close our cursor and our connection,
since the database can only keep a limited number of these open at one time.
Since establishing a connection takes time,
though,
we shouldn’t open a connection,
do one operation,
then close the connection,
only to reopen it a few microseconds later to do another operation.
Instead,
it’s normal to create one connection that stays open for the lifetime of the program.</p>

<p>Queries in real applications will often depend on values provided by users.
For example,
this function takes a user’s ID as a parameter and returns their name:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">sqlite3</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_name</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">database_file</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">person_id</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="n">cursor</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">close</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">connection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">close</span><span class="p">()</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">results</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We use string concatenation on the first line of this function
to construct a query containing the user ID we have been given.
This seems simple enough,
but what happens if someone gives us this string as input?</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>dyer'; DROP TABLE Survey; SELECT '
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It looks like there’s garbage after the user’s ID,
but it is very carefully chosen garbage.
If we insert this string into our query,
the result is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT personal || ' ' || family FROM Person WHERE id='dyer'; DROP TABLE Survey; SELECT '';
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we execute this,
it will erase one of the tables in our database.</p>

<p>This is called an SQL injection attack,
and it has been used to attack thousands of programs over the years.
In particular,
many web sites that take data from users insert values directly into queries
without checking them carefully first.
A very <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/">relevant XKCD</a> that explains the
dangers of using raw input in queries a little more succinctly:</p>

<p><a href="../../images/xkcd/exploits_of_a_mom.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="../../images/xkcd/exploits_of_a_mom.png" alt="A 4 panel comic, in the first panel a person is shown answering the phone, hearing that their son's school has some computer trouble. In panel 2 they apologises asking if their child broke something. In panel 3, the unseen person on the other end of the phone call asks if they really named their son Robert'); Drop table students;--? They respond saying 'oh yes. little bobby tables we call him.' In the 4th panel the caller says 'well we have lost this years student records, I hope you're happy.' They respond 'And I hope you've learned to sanitize your database inputs'." width="666" height="205" loading="lazy" /></a></p>

<p>Since a villain might try to smuggle commands into our queries in many different ways,
the safest way to deal with this threat is
to replace characters like quotes with their escaped equivalents,
so that we can safely put whatever the user gives us inside a string.
We can do this by using a prepared statement
instead of formatting our statements as strings.
Here’s what our example program looks like if we do this:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">sqlite3</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_name</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">database_file</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">person_id</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">SELECT personal || </span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s"> || family FROM Person WHERE id=?;</span><span class="sh">"</span>

    <span class="n">connection</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sqlite3</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">connect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">database_file</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">cursor</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">connection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">cursor</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">cursor</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">execute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">query</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">person_id</span><span class="p">])</span>
    <span class="n">results</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cursor</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">fetchall</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">cursor</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">close</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">connection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">close</span><span class="p">()</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">results</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">Full name for dyer:</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nf">get_name</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">survey.db</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">dyer</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The key changes are in the query string and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">execute</code> call.
Instead of formatting the query ourselves,
we put question marks in the query template where we want to insert values.
When we call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">execute</code>,
we provide a list
that contains as many values as there are question marks in the query.
The library matches values to question marks in order,
and translates any special characters in the values
into their escaped equivalents
so that they are safe to use.</p>

<p>We can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sqlite3</code>’s cursor to make changes to our database,
such as inserting a new name.
For instance, we can define a new function called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add_name</code> like so:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">sqlite3</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add_name</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">database_file</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">new_person</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">INSERT INTO Person (id, personal, family) VALUES (?, ?, ?);</span><span class="sh">"</span>

  <p>Write a Python program that creates a new database called

the values greater than 20.0 from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">original.db</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">backup.db</code>.
Which is faster: filtering values in the query, or reading

    <p>The first example reads all the data into memory and filters the
numbers using the if statement in Python.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import sqlite3

    <p>In contrast the following example uses the conditional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SELECT</code> statement
to filter the numbers in SQL.
The only lines that changed are in line 5, where the values are fetched
from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">original.db</code> and the for loop starting in line 15 used to insert
the numbers into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">backup.db</code>.
Note how this version does not require the use of Python’s if statement.</p>
