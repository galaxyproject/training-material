<h2 id="types">Types</h2>

<p>Every value in a program has a specific type.</p>

<h3 id="checking-the-type">Checking the Type</h3>

<p>Use the built-in function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type</code> to find out what type a value has. This works on values as well as variables. But remember: the <em>value</em> has the type — the <em>variable</em> is just a label.</p>

<p>Check the type of values with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functions.html#type"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type()</code></a> function:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">52</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">3.14159</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also check the types of variables</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">fitness</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">average</span><span class="sh">'</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fitness</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>

<p>A value’s type determines what the program can do to it. Some operations may work</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And some operations may not work:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">hello</span><span class="sh">'</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">h</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For instance, you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> operators on strings.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">full_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">Ahmed</span><span class="sh">'</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="sh">'</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">Walsh</span><span class="sh">'</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">full_name</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">separator</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">=</span><span class="sh">'</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">10</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">separator</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some methods only accept specific types, or only work on specific types.</p>

<p>The built-in function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">len</code> returns the length of your data. Which of the following would you expect to work? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">len(string)</code>? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">len(int)</code>?</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">full_name</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">52</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="matching-types">Matching Types</h3>

<p>Not all types support all operations, adding an integer to a string doesn’t make much sense:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">2</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This does not work because it’s ambiguous: should <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1 + '2'</code> be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3</code> (a number) or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'12'</code> (a string)? Some types can be converted to other types by using the type name as a function.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nf">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">2</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">2</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="operation-support">Operation Support</h3>

<p>Here is a quick chart showing which operations are allowed for each pair:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Left\Right</th>
      <th><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code></th>
      <th><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code></th>
      <th><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+-*/</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+-*/</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+-*/</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+-*/</code></td>
      <td>``</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code></td>
      <td>``</td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>As you can see you can do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3 * "test"</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"test" * 3</code>, but it doesn’t work with floats.</p>

<h2 id="can-mix-integers-and-floats-freely-in-operations">Can mix integers and floats freely in operations.</h2>

<p>Integers and floating-point numbers can be mixed in arithmetic. Python 3 (which we use) automatically converts integers to floats as needed.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">half is </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mf">2.0</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="variables-only-change-value-when-something-is-assigned-to-them">Variables only change value when something is assigned to them.</h2>

<p>If we make one cell in a spreadsheet depend on another, and update the latter,
the former updates automatically. However, this does <strong>not</strong> happen in programming languages.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">variable_one</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="n">variable_two</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">variable_one</span>
<span class="n">variable_one</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">first is </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">variable_one</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s"> and second is </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">variable_two</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The computer reads the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">first</code> when doing the multiplication, creates
a new value, and assigns it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">second</code>. After that, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">second</code> does not remember
where it came from. Every computation happens line-by-line.</p>

  <p>What type of value (integer, floating point number, or character string)

    <li>Time elapsed from the start of the year until now in days.</li>

    <p>The answers to the questions are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Integer, since the number of days would lie between 1 and 365.</li>
      <li>Floating point, since fractional days are required</li>
      <li>Character string if serial number contains letters and numbers, otherwise integer if the serial number consists only of numerals</li>
      <li>This will vary! How do you define a specimen’s age? whole days since collection (integer)? date and time (string)?</li>
      <li>Choose floating point to represent population as large aggregates (eg millions), or integer to represent population in units of individuals.</li>
      <li>Floating point number, since an average is likely to have a fractional part.</li>

  <p>Given this information, what do you expect the following program to do?</p>

  <p>What does it actually do?</p>

  <p>Why do you think it does that?</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>print("fractional string to int:", int("3.4"))
</code></pre></div>  </div>

    <p>What do you expect this program to do? It would not be so unreasonable to expect the Python 3 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code> command to
convert the string “3.4” to 3.4 and an additional type conversion to 3. After all, Python 3 performs a lot of other
magic - isn’t that part of its charm?</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>int("3.4")
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>However, Python 3 throws an error.</p>
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '3.4'
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Why? To be consistent, possibly. If you ask Python to perform two consecutive
typecasts, you must convert it explicitly in code.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>int(float("3.4"))
</code></pre></div>    </div>
