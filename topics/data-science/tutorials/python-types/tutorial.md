Python is a typed language, data has a type, and different types of data cannot always be connected immediately and might need some conversion step before they can be used together. For instance if you add a number to a number, what should happen? If you add a number to a message, what do you expect will happen?

## Types

Every value in a program has a specific type.

Name                  | Python Code | Represents
---                   | ---         | ---
Integer               | `int`       | represents positive or negative whole numbers like 3 or -512.
Floating point number | `float`     | represents real numbers like 3.14159 or -2.5.
Character string      | `str`       | text, written with either `'` or `"` quotes (they must match)

### Checking the Type

Use the built-in function `type` to find out what type a value has. This works on values as well as variables. But remember: the *value* has the type --- the *variable* is just a label.

Check the type of values with the [`type()`](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functions.html#type) function:

```python
print(type(52))
print(type(3.14159))
```

You can also check the types of variables

```python
fitness = 'average'
print(type(fitness))
```

### Methods

A value's type determines what the program can do to it. Some operations may work

```python
print(5 - 3)
```

And some operations may not work:

```python
print('hello' - 'h')
```

For instance, you can use the `+` and `*` operators on strings.

```python
full_name = 'Ahmed' + ' ' + 'Walsh'
print(full_name)
separator = '=' * 10
print(separator)
```

Some methods only accept specific types, or only work on specific types.

The built-in function `len` returns the length of your data. Which of the following would you expect to work? `len(string)`? `len(int)`?

```python
print(len(full_name))
print(len(52))
```

### Matching Types

Not all types support all operations, adding an integer to a string doesn't make much sense:

```python
print(1 + '2')
```

This does not work because it's ambiguous: should `1 + '2'` be `3` (a number) or `'12'` (a string)? Some types can be converted to other types by using the type name as a function.

```python
print(1 + int('2'))
print(str(1) + '2')
```

### Operation Support

Here is a quick chart showing which operations are allowed for each pair:

Left\Right | `int`  | `float` | `str`
---------- | ---    | -----   | ---
`int`      | `+-*/` | `+-*/`  | `*`
`float`    | `+-*/` | `+-*/`  | ``
`str`      | `*`    | ``      | `+`

As you can see you can do `3 * "test"` and `"test" * 3`, but it doesn't work with floats.

## Can mix integers and floats freely in operations.

Integers and floating-point numbers can be mixed in arithmetic. Python 3 (which we use) automatically converts integers to floats as needed.

```python
print(f'half is {1 / 2.0}')
print(f'three squared is {3.0 ** 2}')
```


## Variables only change value when something is assigned to them.

If we make one cell in a spreadsheet depend on another, and update the latter,
the former updates automatically. However, this does **not** happen in programming languages.

```python
variable_one = 1
variable_two = 5 * variable_one
variable_one = 2
print(f'first is {variable_one} and second is {variable_two}')
```

The computer reads the value of `first` when doing the multiplication, creates
a new value, and assigns it to `second`. After that, `second` does not remember
where it came from. Every computation happens line-by-line.
