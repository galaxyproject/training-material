<h2 id="indexing">Indexing</h2>

<p>You can use an item’s index to fetch it from a list.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">zeroth item of pressures: </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">pressures</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="replacement">Replacement</h2>

<p>Lists’ values can be changed or replaced by assigning a new value to the position in the list.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">pressures</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.265</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note how the first item has changed from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.273</code></p>

<h2 id="appending">Appending</h2>

<p>Appending items to a list lengthens it. You can do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">list_name.append()</code> to add items to the end of a list.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">primes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">primes is initially: </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">primes</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">primes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">primes has become: </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">primes</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.append()</code> is a <em>method</em> of lists. It’s like a function, but tied to a particular object. You use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">object_name.method_name</code> to call methods, which deliberately resembles the way we refer to things in a library.</p>

<p>We will meet other methods of lists as we go along. Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">help(list)</code> for a preview. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extend</code> is similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">append</code>, but it allows you to combine two lists.  For example:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">teen_primes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">13</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">17</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">middle_aged_primes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">37</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">41</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">43</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">47</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">primes is currently: </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">primes</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">primes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">extend</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">teen_primes</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">primes has now become: </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">primes</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">primes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">middle_aged_primes</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">primes has finally become: </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">primes</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extend</code> maintains the “flat” structure of the list, appending a list to a list makes the result two-dimensional - the last element in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">primes</code> is a list, not an integer.</p>

<p>This starts to become a more complicated data structure, and we’ll use more of these later. A list containing both integers and a list can be called a “hetereogenous” list, since it has multiple different data types. This is relatively uncommon, most of the lists you’ll encounter will have a single data type inside of them. Sometimes you’ll see a list of lists, which can be used to store positions, like a chessboard.</p>

<h2 id="list-indices">List Indices</h2>

<p>In computer science and programming we number the positions within a list starting from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>, rather than from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Position  0         1          2            3           4

<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">weekdays</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">weekdays</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">weekdays</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But if you try an access a position that is outside of the list, you’ll get an error</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">weekdays</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>returns a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IndexError: list index out of range</code>.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">

  <p>So how do you read this?</p>
  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>However, sometimes you want to access the very end of a list! You can either start at the beginning and count along to find the last item or second to last item, or you can use Negative Indices</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Position  0         1          2            3           4

<span class="c1"># Position  -5        -4         -3           -2          -1
</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">weekdays</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">weekdays</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">weekdays</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you wanted to find the last value in a list, you could also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">len(elements)</code> and then subtract back to find the index you want</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">elements</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nf">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">elements</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is essentially how negative indexes work, except you don’t have to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">len(elements)</code>, that’s done for you automatically.</p>

<h2 id="removing-items">Removing Items.</h2>

<p>You can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">del</code> to remove items from a list entirely. We use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">del list_name[index]</code> to remove an element from a list (in the example, 9 is not a prime number) and thus shorten it. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">del</code> is not a function or a method, but a statement in the language.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">primes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">primes after removing last item: </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">primes</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>The empty list contains no values. When you want to make a new list, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[]</code> on its own to represent a list that doesn’t contain any values. This is helpful as a starting point for collecting values, which we’ll see soon.</p>

<h2 id="heterogeneous-lists">Heterogeneous Lists</h2>

<p>Lists may contain values of different types. A single list may contain numbers, strings, and anything else.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">goals</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">Create lists.</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">Extract items from lists.</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">Modify lists.</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">]</span>

<h2 id="strings-are-like-lists">Strings are like Lists</h2>

<p>Text is often called a “string” in the programming world. Strings of text like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name = "Helena"</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">patient_id = "19237zud830"</code> are very similar conceptually to lists. Except instead of being a list of numbers, they’re a lists of characters.</p>

<p>In a number of older programming languages, strings are indeed arrays of numbers internally. However python hides a lot of that complexity from us, so we can just work with text.</p>

<p>Still, many of the operations you use on lists, can also be used on strings as well! Strings can be indexed like lists so you can get single elements from lists.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">element</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">carbon</span><span class="sh">'</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">zeroth character: </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">element</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">third character: </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">element</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Strings, however, cannot be modified, you can’t change a single letter in a string. Things that cannot be modified after creation are called <em>immutable</em> or sometimes <em>frozen</em>, compared to things which can be modified which are called <em>mutable</em>.
Python considers the string to be a single value with parts, not a collection of values.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">element</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">C</span><span class="sh">'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="bounds">Bounds</h2>

<p>You cannot access values beyond the end of the list, this will result in an error. Python reports an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IndexError</code> if we attempt to access a value that doesn’t exist. This is a kind of <strong>runtime error</strong>, as it cannot be detected as the code is parsed. Imagine if you had a script which let you read in a file, depending on how many lines were in the file, whether index 90 was valid or invalid, would depend on how big your file was.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">99th element of element is: </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">element</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">99</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>Accessing only a portion of a list is commonly used, say if you have a list of FastQ files from paired end sequencing, perhaps you want two of them at a time. You could access those with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[0:2]</code>.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># You don't need to start at 0

<p>If you don’t supply an end value, Python will default to going to the end of the list. Likewise, if you don’t provide a start value, Python will use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> as the start by default, until whatever end value you provide.</p>

<h2 id="stride">Stride</h2>

<p>However, list slicing can be more complicated. You can additionally use a ‘stride’ parameter, which is how Python should strep through the list. To take every other element from a list:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">values</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">values</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="c1"># every other value
</span><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">values</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="c1"># every other value from the second value
</span><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">values</span><span class="p">[::</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="c1"># the start and end are optional
</span><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">values</span><span class="p">[::</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="c1"># every third value in the list.
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>So list slicing together is either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">list[low:high]</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">list[low:high:stride]</code>, where low and high are optional if you just want to go to the end of the list.</p>

<h2 id="sorting">Sorting</h2>

<p>Lists occasionally need to be sorted. For example, you have a list of students you might want to alphabetise, and here you can use the function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sorted</code> to help you.</p>

  <p>Some analyses (especially simultaions) can be dependent on data input order or data sorting. This was recently seen in <span class="citation"><a href="#Bhandari_Neupane_2019">Neupane <i>et al.</i> 2019</a></span> where the data files used were sorted one way on Windows, and another on Linux, resulting in different results for the same code and the same datasets! Yikes!</p>

  <p>If you know your analyses are dependent on file ordering, then you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sorted()</code> to make sure the data is provided in a uniform way every time.</p>

  <p>If you’re not sure if your results will be dependent, you can try sorting anyway. Or better yet, randomising the list of inputs to make sure your code behaves properly in any scenario.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Convert text to a list

    <p>The list <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">values[start:stop]</code> has up to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stop - start</code> elements.  For example,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">values[1:4]</code> has the 3 elements <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">values[1]</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">values[2]</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">values[3]</code>.
Why ‘up to’?

<p>In Python we create a dictionary with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{}</code> and use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:</code> to separate keys and values. Turning the above list into a Python dictionary, it would look like:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">populations</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">South Sudan</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">492970</span><span class="p">,</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see a string (the country name) being used for the key, and then the number (an integer) as the value. (Would a float make sense? Why or why not?)</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <div class="box-title tip-title" id="tip-other-names-1"><button class="gtn-boxify-button tip" type="button" aria-controls="tip-other-names-1" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Tip: Other Names</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>
  <p>They’re also sometimes called associative arrays (because they’re an array or list of values that associate a key to a value) or maps (because they map a key to a value), depending on what you’re reading.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>

<p>You can access both the keys, and the values</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">populations</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">keys</span><span class="p">())</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">populations</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">values</span><span class="p">())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These will print out two list-like objects. They will become more useful in the future when we talk about looping over dictionaries and processing all of the values within.</p>

<h2 id="accessing-values">Accessing Values</h2>

<p>Just like lists where you access by the position in the list</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">populations</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">Namibia</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And just like lists, if you try an access a key that isn’t there or an index outside of the range of the list:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">populations</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">Mars</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <div class="box-title tip-title" id="tip-dictionaries-are-faster-than-lists-for-looking-up-values-1"><button class="gtn-boxify-button tip" type="button" aria-controls="tip-dictionaries-are-faster-than-lists-for-looking-up-values-1" aria-expanded="true"><i class="far fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true" ></i> <span>Tip: Dictionaries are faster than lists for looking up values</span><span class="fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square"></span></button></div>
  <p>Just like in real life, searching a dictionary for a specific term is quite fast. Often a lot faster than searching a list for a specific value.</p>

  <p>For those of you old enough to remember the paper version of a dictionary, you knew that As would be at the start and Zs at the end, and probably Ms around the middle. And if you were looking for a word like “Squirrel”, you’d open the dictionary in the middle, maybe decide it was in the second half of the book, randomly choose a page in the second half, and you could keep deciding if it was “before” or “after” the current page, never even bothering to search the first half.</p>

  <p>Conceptually, compared with a list, you can’t make this guess of if the item is in the first or second half. You need to search item by item, it would be like reading page by page until you get to Squirrel in the dictionary.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="modifying-dictionaries">Modifying Dictionaries</h2>

<p>Adding new values to a dictionary is easy, it’s very similar to replacing a value in a list.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># For lists we did
</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">x</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">y</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">z</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">x</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">a</span><span class="sh">'</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For dictionaries, it’s essentially the same, we access the ‘place’ in the dictionary just like we did with a list, and set it to a value</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">populations</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">Mars</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span> <span class="c1"># robots
</span><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">populations</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And similarly, removing items is the same as it was for lists:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">del</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="c1"># Removes the first item
</span><span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And with dictionaries you delete by specifying which position/key you want to remove</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">del</span> <span class="n">populations</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">Australia</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">populations</span><span class="p">)</span>

  <p>DNA is usually in the form of dsDNA, a paired strand, where A maps to T and C maps to G and vice versa.

    <ol>
      <li>Here you need to use an integer, a fractional or float value would not make sense. You cannot have half an A/C/T/G.</li>
      <li>Here a string would be a good choice. (And probably just a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> string, rather than a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">first</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">last</code> name, as not all humans have two names! And some have more than two.)</li>
      <li>An integer is good type for storing weight, if you are using a small unit (e.g. grams). Otherwise you might consider a float, but you’d need to be careful to format it properly (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{value:0.2f}</code>) when printing it out. It depends on the application.</li>
      <li>This is a case where you should consider carefully the application, but <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bool</code> is usally the <em>wrong answer</em>. Are you recording patient data? Is their expressed gender the correct variable or did you need sex? <span class="citation"><a href="#Miyagi_2021">Miyagi <i>et al.</i> 2021</a></span> goes into detail on this multifaceted issue in a medical research context. For example chromosomal sex is also more complicated and cannot be stored with a true/false value, as people with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klinefelter_syndrome">Kleinfelters</a> exist. A string can be an ok choice here.</li>
      <li>There is a limited vocabulary humans use to describe hair colour, so a string can be used, or a data type we haven’t discussed! An <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enum</code> is an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enumeration</code>, and when you have a limited set of values that are possible, you can use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enum</code> to double check that whatever value is being used (or read from a file, or entered by a user) matches one of the “approved” values.</li>
      <li>A float is a good guess, but with floats come weird rounding issues. Often times people choose to use an integer storing the value in cents (or fractional cents, to whatever the desired precision is).</li>
