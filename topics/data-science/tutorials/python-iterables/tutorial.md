# Lists

Doing calculations with a hundred variables called `pressure_001`, `pressure_002`, etc. would be at least as slow as doing them by hand. Using a *list* to store many values together solves that problems. Lists are surrounded by square brackets: `[`, `]`, with values separated by commas:

```python
pressures = [0.273, 0.275, 0.277, 0.275, 0.276]
print(f'pressures: {pressures}')
print(f'length: {len(pressures)}')
```

## Indexing

You can use an item's index to fetch it from a list.

```python
print(f'zeroth item of pressures: {pressures[0]}')
print(f'fourth item of pressures: {pressures[4]}')
```

## Replacement

Lists' values can be changed or replaced by assigning a new value to the position in the list.

```python
pressures[0] = 0.265
print(f'pressures is now: {pressures}')
```

Note how the first item has changed from `0.273`

## Appending

Appending items to a list lengthens it. You can do `list_name.append()` to add items to the end of a list.

```python
primes = [2, 3, 5]
print(f'primes is initially: {primes}')
primes.append(7)
print(f'primes has become: {primes}')
```


`.append()` is a *method* of lists. It's like a function, but tied to a particular object. You use `object_name.method_name` to call methods, which deliberately resembles the way we refer to things in a library.

We will meet other methods of lists as we go along. Use `help(list)` for a preview. `extend` is similar to `append`, but it allows you to combine two lists.  For example:

```python
teen_primes = [11, 13, 17, 19]
middle_aged_primes = [37, 41, 43, 47]
print(f'primes is currently: {primes}')
primes.extend(teen_primes)
print(f'primes has now become: {primes}')
primes.append(middle_aged_primes)
print(f'primes has finally become: {primes}')
```

Note that while `extend` maintains the "flat" structure of the list, appending a list to a list makes the result two-dimensional - the last element in `primes` is a list, not an integer.

This starts to become a more complicated data structure, and we'll use more of these later. A list containing both integers and a list can be called a "hetereogenous" list, since it has multiple different data types. This is relatively uncommon, most of the lists you'll encounter will have a single data type inside of them. Sometimes you'll see a list of lists, which can be used to store positions, like a chessboard.

## List Indices

In computer science and programming we number the positions within a list starting from `0`, rather than from `1`.

```python
# Position  0         1          2            3           4
weekdays = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']
print(weekdays[0])
print(weekdays[4])
print(weekdays[3])
```

But if you try an access a position that is outside of the list, you'll get an error

```python
print(weekdays[9])
```

returns a `IndexError: list index out of range`.

{: .tip}

However, sometimes you want to access the very end of a list! You can either start at the beginning and count along to find the last item or second to last item, or you can use Negative Indices

```python
# Position  0         1          2            3           4
weekdays = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']
# Position  -5        -4         -3           -2          -1

print(weekdays[-1])
print(weekdays[-2])
print(weekdays[-4])
```

If you wanted to find the last value in a list, you could also use `len(elements)` and then subtract back to find the index you want

```python
elements[len(elements)-1]
```

This is essentially how negative indexes work, except you don't have to use `len(elements)`, that's done for you automatically.


## Removing Items.

You can use `del` to remove items from a list entirely. We use `del list_name[index]` to remove an element from a list (in the example, 9 is not a prime number) and thus shorten it. `del` is not a function or a method, but a statement in the language.

```python
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
print(f'primes before removing last item: {primes}')
del primes[4]
print(f'primes after removing last item: {primes}')
```

## Empty Lists

The empty list contains no values. When you want to make a new list, use `[]` on its own to represent a list that doesn't contain any values. This is helpful as a starting point for collecting values, which we'll see soon.

## Heterogeneous Lists

Lists may contain values of different types. A single list may contain numbers, strings, and anything else.

```python
goals = [1, 'Create lists.', 2, 'Extract items from lists.', 3, 'Modify lists.']
```

## Strings are like Lists

Text is often called a "string" in the programming world. Strings of text like `name = "Helena"` or `patient_id = "19237zud830"` are very similar conceptually to lists. Except instead of being a list of numbers, they're a lists of characters.

In a number of older programming languages, strings are indeed arrays of numbers internally. However python hides a lot of that complexity from us, so we can just work with text.

Still, many of the operations you use on lists, can also be used on strings as well! Strings can be indexed like lists so you can get single elements from lists.

```python
element = 'carbon'
print(f'zeroth character: {element[0]}')
print(f'third character: {element[3]}')
```

Strings, however, cannot be modified, you can't change a single letter in a string. Things that cannot be modified after creation are called *immutable* or sometimes *frozen*, compared to things which can be modified which are called *mutable*.
Python considers the string to be a single value with parts, not a collection of values.

```python
element[0] = 'C'
```

## Bounds

You cannot access values beyond the end of the list, this will result in an error. Python reports an `IndexError` if we attempt to access a value that doesn't exist. This is a kind of **runtime error**, as it cannot be detected as the code is parsed. Imagine if you had a script which let you read in a file, depending on how many lines were in the file, whether index 90 was valid or invalid, would depend on how big your file was.

```python
print(f'99th element of element is: {element[99]}')
```

{: .question}

```python
# Split me
data = "0,0,1,3,1,2,4,7,8,3,3,3,10,5,7,4,7,7,12,18,6,13,11,11,7,7,4,6,8,8,4,4,5,7,3,4,2,3,0,0"
```

# Slicing & Dicing

All of the data types we've talked about today can be sliced, and this will be a key part of using lists.

```python
elements = ['H', 'He', 'Li', 'Be', 'B', 'C', 'N', 'O', 'F']
# Instead of accessing a single element
print(elements[0])
# We'll access a range
print(elements[0:4])
```

Accessing only a portion of a list is commonly used, say if you have a list of FastQ files from paired end sequencing, perhaps you want two of them at a time. You could access those with `[0:2]`.

```python
# You don't need to start at 0
print(elements[6:8])
```

```python
# But your end should be bigger than your start.
# What do you think this will return?
# Make a guess before you run it
print(elements[6:5])
```

If you don't supply an end value, Python will default to going to the end of the list. Likewise, if you don't provide a start value, Python will use `0` as the start by default, until whatever end value you provide.

```

## Stride

However, list slicing can be more complicated. You can additionally use a 'stride' parameter, which is how Python should strep through the list. To take every other element from a list:

```python
values = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
print(values[0:12:2]) # every other value
print(values[1:12:2]) # every other value from the second value
print(values[::2]) # the start and end are optional
print(values[::3]) # every third value in the list.
```

So list slicing together is either `list[low:high]` or `list[low:high:stride]`, where low and high are optional if you just want to go to the end of the list.

## Sorting

Lists occasionally need to be sorted. For example, you have a list of students you might want to alphabetise, and here you can use the function `sorted` to help you.

```python
students = [
    'Koos Christabella',
    'Zackary Habiba',
    'Jumana Rostam',
    'Sorina Gaia',
    'Kalyani Bessarion',
    'Enéas Nirmala',
    '王奕辰',
    '刘依诺',
]
students = sorted(students)
print(students)
```

> <tip-title>Sorting names is hard!</tip-title>
> Some people have 1 name, some have 4 or more! Some cultures have surnames first, some not. Sorting names is a complex situation, so be sure you consider your data before sorting and assuming it's correct. Test with multiple values to make sure your code works!

> <tip-title>Results can be dependent on analysis order!</tip-title>
> Some analyses (especially simultaions) can be dependent on data input order or data sorting.

Yikes!
>
> If you know your analyses are dependent on file ordering, then you can use `sorted()` to make sure the data is provided in a uniform way every time.
>
> If you're not sure if your results will be dependent, you can try sorting anyway. Or better yet, randomising the list of inputs to make sure your code behaves properly in any scenario.
{: .tip}

## Type Conversion

Just list with converting `"1.5"` to an float with the `float()` function, or `3.1` to a string with `str()`, we can do the same with lists using the `list()` function, and sets with `set()`:

```python
# Convert text to a list
print(list("sometext"))
```

Converting a list back into text is likewise possible, but you need to use the special function `join`. Join is a function of a `str`, which accepts a list

```python
word = ['c', 'a', 'f', 'e']
print("-".join(word))
```

It takes the string you called it on, and uses that as a separator. Then for the list that you provide, it joins that together with the separator.

# Dictionaries

When you think of a Dictionary, you should think of a real life Dictionary, they map some key to a value. Like a term to it's definition

Key | Value
--- | ---
`Eichhörnchen` | Squirrel
`火锅` | Hot Pot

Or a Country to it's population

Key               | Value
---               | ---
South Sudan       | 492,970
Australia         | 411,667
Guinea            | 1,660,973
Morocco           | 573,895
Maldives          | 221,678
Wallis and Futuna | 1,126
Eswatini          | 94,874
Namibia           | 325,858
Turkmenistan      | 1,031,992

In Python we create a dictionary with `{}` and use `:` to separate keys and values. Turning the above list into a Python dictionary, it would look like:

```python
populations = {
  "South Sudan": 492970,
  "Australia": 411667,
  "Guinea": 1660973,
  "Morocco": 573895,
  "Maldives": 221678,
  "Wallis and Futuna": 1126,
  "Eswatini": 94874,
  "Namibia": 325858,
  "Turkmenistan": 1031992,
}
```

You can see a string (the country name) being used for the key, and then the number (an integer) as the value. (Would a float make sense? Why or why not?)

> <tip-title>Other Names</tip-title>
> They're also sometimes called associative arrays (because they're an array or list of values that associate a key to a value) or maps (because they map a key to a value), depending on what you're reading.
{: .tip}

## Methods

You can access both the keys, and the values

```python
print(populations.keys())
print(populations.values())
```

These will print out two list-like objects. They will become more useful in the future when we talk about looping over dictionaries and processing all of the values within.

## Accessing Values

Just like lists where you access by the position in the list

```python
print(populations["Namibia"])
```

And just like lists, if you try an access a key that isn't there or an index outside of the range of the list:

```python
print(populations["Mars"])
```


> <tip-title>Dictionaries are faster than lists for looking up values</tip-title>
> Just like in real life, searching a dictionary for a specific term is quite fast. Often a lot faster than searching a list for a specific value.
>
> For those of you old enough to remember the paper version of a dictionary, you knew that As would be at the start and Zs at the end, and probably Ms around the middle. And if you were looking for a word like "Squirrel", you'd open the dictionary in the middle, maybe decide it was in the second half of the book, randomly choose a page in the second half, and you could keep deciding if it was "before" or "after" the current page, never even bothering to search the first half.
>
> Conceptually, compared with a list, you can't make this guess of if the item is in the first or second half. You need to search item by item, it would be like reading page by page until you get to Squirrel in the dictionary.
{: .tip}

## Modifying Dictionaries

Adding new values to a dictionary is easy, it's very similar to replacing a value in a list.

```python
# For lists we did
x = ['x', 'y', 'z']
x[0] = 'a'
print(x)
```

For dictionaries, it's essentially the same, we access the 'place' in the dictionary just like we did with a list, and set it to a value

```python
populations["Mars"] = 6 # robots
print(populations)
```

And similarly, removing items is the same as it was for lists:

```python
print(x)
del x[0] # Removes the first item
print(x)
```

And with dictionaries you delete by specifying which position/key you want to remove

```python
del populations['Australia']
print(populations)
```

# Choosing the Right Data Type

Choosing the correct data type can sometimes require some thought, and even discussion with colleagues. And don't be afraid to search the internet for how other people have done it!


Data type       | Examples                  | When to use it | When **not** to use it
---             | ---                       | ---- | ----
Boolean (`bool`) | `True`, `False` | If there are only two possible states, true or false | If your data is not binary
Integer (`int`) | 1, 0, -1023, 42           | Countable, singular items. How many patients are there, how many events did you record, how many variants are there in the sequence | If doubling or halving the value would not make sense: do not use for e.g. patient IDs, or phone numbers. If these are integers you might accidentally do math on the value.
Float (`float`) | 123.49, 3.14159, -3.33334 | If you need more precision or partial values. Recording distance between places, height, mass, etc.
Strings (`str`) | 'patient_12312', 'Jane Doe', '火锅' | To store free text, identifiers, sequence IDs, etc. | If it's truly a numeric value you can do calculations with, like adding or subtracting or doing statistics.
List / Array (`list`) | `['A', 1, 3.4, ['Nested']]` | If you need to store a list of items, like sequences from a file. Especially if you're reading in a table of data from a file. | If you want to retrieve individual values, and there are clear identifiers it might be better as a dict.
Dictionary / Associative Array / map (`dict`) | `{"weight": 3.4, "age": 12, "name": "Fluffy"}` | When you have identifiers for your data, and want to look them up by that value. E.g. looking up sequences by an identifier, or data about students based on their name. Counting values. | If you just have a list of items without identifiers, it makes more sense to just use a list.

> > 1. Here you need to use an integer, a fractional or float value would not make sense. You cannot have half an A/C/T/G.
> > 1. Here a string would be a good choice. (And probably just a single `name` string, rather than a `first` and `last` name, as not all humans have two names! And some have more than two.)
> > 2. An integer is good type for storing weight, if you are using a small unit (e.g. grams). Otherwise you might consider a float, but you'd need to be careful to format it properly (e.g. `{value:0.2f}`) when printing it out. It depends on the application.
> > 3. This is a case where you should consider carefully the application, but `bool` is usally the *wrong answer*. Are you recording patient data? Is their expressed gender the correct variable or did you need sex? {% cite Miyagi_2021 %} goes into detail on this multifaceted issue in a medical research context. For example chromosomal sex is also more complicated and cannot be stored with a true/false value, as people with [Kleinfelters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klinefelter_syndrome) exist. A string can be an ok choice here.
> > 4. There is a limited vocabulary humans use to describe hair colour, so a string can be used, or a data type we haven't discussed! An `enum` is an `enumeration`, and when you have a limited set of values that are possible, you can use a `enum` to double check that whatever value is being used (or read from a file, or entered by a user) matches one of the "approved" values.
> > 5. A float is a good guess, but with floats come weird rounding issues. Often times people choose to use an integer storing the value in cents (or fractional cents, to whatever the desired precision is).
