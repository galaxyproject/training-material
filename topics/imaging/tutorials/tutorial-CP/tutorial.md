# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

The nucleolus is a prominent structure of the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and is involved in ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle regulation. In DNA staining of cells, nucleoli can be identified as the absence of DNA in nuclei ([Fig. 1](#nucleoli)).  
Phenotypes caused by reduced gene function are widely used to elucidate gene function and image-based RNA interference (RNAi) screens are routinely used to find and characterize genes involved in a particular biological process. While screens typically focus on one biological process of interest, the molecular markers used can also inform on other processes. Re-using published screens image data can then be a cost-effective alternative to performing new experiments.  
In particular, regardless of the targeted biological process, many screens include a DNA label and therefore can also reveal the effect of gene knock-downs on nucleoli.  


<a name="nucleoli"></a>
![DNA channel](../../images/tutorial-CP/img_dna_channel.png "DNA channel from the screen described in {% cite Heriche_2014 %}. The red arrows point at nucleoli."){: width="50%"}

In this tutorial, we will analyse DNA channel images of publicly available RNAi screens to extract numerical descriptors (i.e. features) of nucleoli.
The images and associated metadata will be retrieved from the [Image Data Resource (IDR)](http://idr.openmicroscopy.org/){:target="_blank"}, a repository that collects image datasets of tissues and cells.


To process and analyse the images, we will use [CellProfiler](http://cellprofiler-manual.s3.amazonaws.com/CellProfiler-3.1.9/index.html) ({% cite McQuin_2018 %}), a popular image analysis software. CellProfiler normally comes as a desktop application in which users can compose image analysis workflows from a series of modules. Many of these modules are now also available as tools in Galaxy.

To fully emulate the behaviour of the standalone CellProfiler in Galaxy, each image analysis workflow needs to have three parts: 

1) **StartingModules** {% icon tool %} to initialise the pipeline,

2) tools performing the analysis ([Fig. 2](#high_level_view)): identification of the nuclei, nucleoli and background, together with the feature extraction,

3) **CellProfiler** {% icon tool %} to actually run the pipeline.

<a name="high_level_view"></a>
![High-level view of the workflow](../../images/tutorial-CP/wf.jpg "High-level view of the workflow")

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a workflow that downloads a selection of images from the IDR, and uses CellProfiler to segment the nuclei and nucleoli. You will also learn how to extract and export features at three different levels: image, nucleus, nucleolus.

# Start CellProfiler pipeline

The tool **Starting Modules** {% icon tool %} comprises the first 4 modules of the standalone CellProfiler. It needs to be the first tool of a workflow because it sets the naming and metadata handling for the rest of tools.

These fields indicate to which plate the image belongs, what is the identifier of the image in the IDR, and the 4 cropping parameters selected. In our case, the upper-left corner (X, Y) and the width and height from there. We have a total of 6 metadata values encoded in the name of the file, separated by `__`. The pattern to extract our metadata from the file name properly is, therefore: `field1__field2__field3__field4__field5__field6`. It is important to keep in mind that, for CellProfiler, our `plateName` will be called `field1`, `imageID` will be `field2`, `cropX` will be `field3`, etc. These matches are relevant for a meaningful interpretation of the features.

# Object segmentation

## Segment nuclei

Since we are interested in segmenting the nucleoli, you may wonder why we need to segment nuclei first. There are several reasons for that: 

- Get the nuclei features. The intensity, size, shape, number of nucleoli per nucleus, etc. can be informative to study the nucleoli.

- Avoid the detection of wrong spots. In a first segmentation, we detect the nuclei, while in the second pass we will segment the holes (nucleoli). The holes need to fall inside the nuclei, and hence the importance of having them segmented too.

In the first step, we will identify the nuclei that are complete, meaning that they are not touching the borders of the image.

{: .question}

From the previous tool, we got a group of objects (nuclei). Now, we want to export the segmentation masks as a single image to check how well the segmentation algorithm is performing. We also want to label the nuclei with their identifiers for future visual inspection of the results. The output of this step will look like (you will only get this image after running the whole workflow):

## Segment nucleoli

The nucleoli are lacking intensity in the DNA staining and therefore, we need to enhance the black holes before masking.

Now that we have all the holes in one mask, we can segment the nucleoli as individual objects in the same way as we did with the nuclei. All the nucleoli can be then combined into one single image.

## Combine segmentation masks

We have now one segmentation mask per image with all the nuclei detected, `MaskNuclei`, and another one for the nucleoli, `MaskNucleoli`. These are binary masks in which the background is black and the objects detected are white. We would like to check whether both segmentation steps went well. That could be achieved by combining both of them (using different colors) into one image. Here, we are converting the nucleus mask to blue and the nucleoli to magenta. The outcome that you will obtain after the execution of the workflow will look like:

![Combined mask for nuclei and nucleoli](../../images/tutorial-CP/img_combined_masks.png "Combined segmentation masks for nuclei (blue) and nucleoli (magenta).")

# Background extraction

The background extraction is useful for quality control. For instance, in a high-exposed or low-contrast image, the nuclei will not be very different from the background and that may lead to the wrong segmentation.

To extract the background, we first need to get the foreground and subtract it from the original image. We already have the nuclei mask, however, we excluded incomplete nuclei, i.e., those touching the borders or those which sizes are outside the specified range. This means that the mask is not covering all the nuclei and we need to get rid of the constraints to get the complete foreground. At this stage, we want to detect everything with a certain intensity (foreground) and subtract it from the complete image to get the background.

# Feature extraction

Now that we have the objects of interest segmented and the background extracted, we can start measuring parameters on them. In particular it is relevant to:

- measure the granularity, texture and intensity of the nuclei and original image,
- measure the intensity of the original image, the background and foreground,
- measure the size and shape of nuclei and nucleoli,
- assess the quality of the original image,
- measure the area ocuppied by nuclei and nucleoli.

A step that requires special attention is the relationship nucleolus-nucleus. This is useful to compute statistics on the number of nucleoli by nucleus.

## Relate nucleoli to their parent nucleus

It might be relevant to compute some statistics on the number of nucleoli inside each nucleus. CellProfiler has a very interesting module to relate both objects, in which each one of the nucleoli is assigned an identifier and linked to the identifier of its parent nucleus.

## Measure the image quality-related parameters

In this section, we will measure the image quality, the area occupied by the nuclei and nucleoli in the original image and the intensity of the foreground and background.

## Export the features to a CSV

All the parameters that we have measured related to the images and objects need to be exported to a file for each one of 6 example images analysed.

# Run the CellProfiler pipeline

All the steps in our workflow (except for the **IDR download** {% icon tool %}) have been passing through an `output_pipeline` as a parameter. This was the way to assemble all the modules from CellProfiler, now we can run all of them together!

>        - {% icon param-file %} *"A tarball of images"*: `output_tar` (output of **IDR Download** {% icon tool %})

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

In this tutorial, you have downloaded images from a public image repository into your Galaxy history. After that, you have built and run a typical image analysis pipeline, composed of segmentation of several objects and feature extraction. As an outcome, you got plenty of features to analyse! And some masks to check that the segmentation algorithms worked as expected. Now you are ready to perform your biological data analysis!
