                <p>Mitochondria act like fuel stations for the cell, supplying the energy needed to keep it functioning and healthy. During certain activities, they can produce bursts of <strong>superoxide</strong>, known as ‘<strong>mitoflashes</strong>.’ These short, intense events occur in individual mitochondria and can be observed in cardiomyocytes, skeletal muscle, hippocampal neurons, chondrocytes, isolated mitochondria, and among other types of eukaryotic cells using confocal microscopy. Commonly detected with a mitochondria-targeted circularly permuted fluorescent protein (mt-cpYFP), mitoflashes provide real-time insights into mitochondrial respiration function <em>in situ</em> and act as a biosensor for superoxide levels, reflecting the activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.</p>

<p>Mitoflashes are triggered by elevated <strong>reactive oxygen species (ROS)</strong> levels, and various physiological and stress-related signals including fluctuations in mitochondrial membrane potential, transient openings of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), calcium level changes, and bioenergetic stress (like nutrient deprivation or high metabolic demand, <span class="citation"><a href="#Wang2022">Wang <i>et al.</i> 2022</a></span>). Additionally, they can be induced during specific cellular processes, like differentiation and certain developmental stages, where mitochondrial function is tightly regulated. This burst event activates the mPTP, causing a depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and a mild alkalization of the matrix (<span class="citation"><a href="#Feng2019">Feng <i>et al.</i> 2019</a></span>). While mitoflashes signal mitochondrial activity and ROS changes, they do not precisely quantify ROS levels or other cellular signatures. These events, however, are able to distinguish active from static mitochondria, making them valuable biomarkers for tracking mitochondrial health and function.</p>

<p>Importantly, the frequency and kinetics of mitoflashes hold physiological and pathophysiological implications. They correlate with key processes such as muscle contraction, cell differentiation, neuron development, wound healing, and lifespan prediction. The frequency and characteristics of mitoflashes vary by cell type; for example, adult cardiomyocytes display approximately 3.8 ± 0.5 mitoflashes, while primary cultured hippocampal neurons show around 31 ± 4 per cell (<span class="citation"><a href="#Li2020">Li <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>).</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn to track mitochondria in live-cell imaging data and detect mitoflashes using Galaxy tools for image analysis. You will work with time-lapse microscopy data, often stored as TIFF files with image stacks, to observe and analyze mitochondrial events across multiple time points. By identifying these events and quantifying their frequency through intensity measurements fitted to a curve, you’ll gain insights into mitochondrial behavior and activity over time.</p>

<p>This tutorial is based on a workflow originally described in <span class="citation"><a href="#Wang2022">Wang <i>et al.</i> 2022</a></span>.</p>

<p>In this section, we will focus on the detection of the mitochondria in a time-lapse image sequence based on local intensity maxima. This will provide insights into mitochondrial energy production and cellular health dynamics in the subsequent analysis.</p>

        <li><strong>Ending time point</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> (use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> to process until the last frame)</li>
        <li><strong>Intensity measurement method</strong>: Set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Smoothed</code> for a more averaged intensity or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Robust</code> for resilience to outliers.</li>
        <li><strong>Threshold</strong>: Start at 10%; lower to 5-8% to catch weaker signals, or raise to 15-20% to focus on the strongest signals.</li>
        <li><strong>Gaussian filter sigma</strong>: Use a value around <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> to suppress noise; increase to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.5</code> if noise is high.</li>
        <li><strong>Boundary pixels</strong>: Set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10</code> to ignore spots within the image edges, adjusting as needed for image size.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This tool detects mitochondria based on intensity maxima. Adjusting the threshold parameter can improve the accuracy of spot detection, allowing to reduce the number of missed or spuriously detected mitochondria (as a rule of thumb, the latter is better tolerable for our analysis).</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

<h2 id="step-2-tracking-mitochondrial-movement">Step 2: Tracking Mitochondrial Movement</h2>

<p>Mitochondria are dynamic organelles, constantly moving, and changing position within the cell. Without tracking, intensity measurements could be inconsistent or misleading, as they might reflect overlapping signals from different mitochondria rather than continuous changes in a single organelle.</p>

<p>By linking each mitochondrion’s position across frames, we ensure that intensity fluctuations represent true changes within the same mitochondrial structure, enabling precise analysis of events like mitoflashes.</p>

        <li><strong>Intensity threshold</strong>: A recommended starting value is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">25%</code> of the global maximum intensity.

      <p>This tool links detected spots across frames to track their movement.

<h1 id="detecting-mitoflashes">Detecting Mitoflashes</h1>

<p>Mitoflashes are identified based on sudden changes in fluorescence intensity in mitochondria, signifying superoxide bursts. We will use a curve-fitting tool to capture these fluctuations and measure their characteristics.</p>

      <p>This step uses polynomial curve fitting to model the basic underlying intensity patterns over time. The chosen <strong>Penalty</strong> ensures that the curve remains robust against brief, high-intensity deviations (e.g., mitoflashes or image noise), preserving the basic intensity trends. Mitoflash events are then identified as intensity values that significantly exceed the fitted curve by a specified threshold. To aid in this identification, an assistive curve is generated to represent the significance threshold, allowing mitoflash events to be easily recognized as those values exceeding the assistive curve.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-and-interpretation-of-results">Analysis and Interpretation of Results</h2>

<p>Congratulations! You’ve reached the final step of your analysis and now have a fully prepared results table, ready for interpretation and further exploration! The output is an Excel file containing the columns <strong>FRAME</strong>, <strong>POS_X</strong>, <strong>POS_Y</strong>, <strong>INTENSITY</strong>, <strong>CURVE</strong>, and <strong>CURVE_A</strong>. This information is available for all detected spots in your image stack and can be used to calculate metrics for interpreting and plotting your mitoflash events results.</p>

<p>Therefore, we can now analyze the <em>frequency</em>, <em>duration</em>, and <em>intensity</em> of the mitoflashes. This data will allow us to understand the physiological significance of mitoflashes in processes like muscle contraction, neuron development, and wound healing. In the upcoming section, we will expand on how to interpret and plot these mitoflash events to give them biological meaning.</p>

<p>Here is an example of what the final output from the curve fitting tool in this tutorial looks like:</p>

      <li>Frame 3 demonstrates a brief but significant increase of the intensity value (<strong>INTENSITY &gt; CURVE_A</strong>), that corresponds to a mitoflash event. Frame 6 shows <strong>CURVE &gt; CURVE_A</strong>, while <strong>INTENSITY</strong> remains below <strong>CURVE_A</strong>.</li>
      <li>Frame 7 represents a borderline case where both <strong>INTENSITY</strong> and <strong>CURVE</strong> are near <strong>CURVE_A</strong>. This could reflect computational noise, weak mitoflash activity, or background fluctuations that do not meet the threshold for a significant event.</li>

<h3 id="key-parameters-for-analysis-and-plotting">Key Parameters for Analysis and Plotting</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>FRAME</strong>: Represents time points in the data, with each row corresponding to a frame in the time-lapse sequence. Use <strong>FRAME</strong> as the x-axis for time-based plotting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>POS_X</strong> and <strong>POS_Y</strong>: These columns provide the coordinates of each detected mitoflash, allowing visualization of mitochondrial movement and spatial distribution within the cell.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>INTENSITY</strong>: Shows the raw intensity values for each mitochondrion at each time point. Plotting <strong>INTENSITY</strong> against <strong>FRAME</strong> reveals fluctuations over time, with peaks indicating mitoflash events.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>CURVE</strong> and <strong>CURVE_A</strong>: Contain fitted curve data that smooths out noise to highlight true intensity peaks. <strong>CURVE</strong> is the main fit, while <strong>CURVE_A</strong> may show adjusted fits if available.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Amplitude (F/F0)</strong>: The peak value in <strong>CURVE</strong> or <strong>CURVE_A</strong>, representing the magnitude of each mitoflash. Higher amplitudes indicate stronger bursts, which can have biological significance.</li>
      <li><strong>Tpk (Time to Peak)</strong>: The frame where <strong>CURVE</strong> or <strong>CURVE_A</strong> reaches maximum intensity, indicating the speed of each mitoflash.</li>
      <li><strong>T50 (Duration)</strong>: The frames where the curve values are at least half of the peak value, representing the mitoflash duration. Longer durations may reflect sustained mitochondrial activity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="suggested-plots">Suggested Plots</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mitoflash Intensity Over Time</strong>: Plot <strong>FRAME</strong> (x-axis) against <strong>INTENSITY</strong> or <strong>CURVE</strong> (y-axis) to observe intensity fluctuations over time, with peaks marking mitoflash events.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Amplitude and Duration Analysis</strong>: Create a histogram or scatter plot of <strong>Amplitude</strong> (from <strong>CURVE</strong> peaks) and <strong>T50</strong> to explore the distribution of mitoflash magnitudes and durations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Spatial Mapping of Mitoflashes</strong>: Use <strong>POS_X</strong> and <strong>POS_Y</strong> for a 2D plot, with each point representing a mitoflash location. Color-code points by <strong>Amplitude</strong> to show intensity distribution across the cell.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This format seamlessly integrates the example data and a question for the user to reflect on and interact with the tutorial, helping them understand how to interpret differences between <strong>INTENSITY</strong>, <strong>CURVE</strong>, and <strong>CURVE_A</strong>.</p>

<p>These analyses and visualizations provide an understanding of mitochondrial activity and responses to cellular conditions, enabling insights into mitochondrial health and function in various states.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In this tutorial, we have covered key techniques for tracking mitochondria and detecting mitoflashes. By processing and analyzing live-cell imaging data, you can gain valuable insights into mitochondrial behavior and health in cells. Tracking mitoflashes can contribute to studies in metabolism, aging, and diseases linked to mitochondrial dysfunction in verious cell types and eukaryotic organisms.</p>
