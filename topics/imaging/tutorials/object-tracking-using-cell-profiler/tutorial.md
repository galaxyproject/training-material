# Introduction


Most biological processes are dynamic and observing them over time can provide valuable insights. Combining fluorescent markers with time-lapse imaging is a common approach to collect data on dynamic cellular processes such as cell division (e.g. {% cite Neumann2010 %}, {% cite Heriche2014%}). However, automated time-lapse imaging can produce large amounts of data that can be challenging to process. One of these challenges is the tracking of individual objects as it is often impossible to manually follow a large number of objects over many time points.

To demonstrate how automatic tracking can be applied in such situations, this tutorial will track dividing nuclei in a short time-lapse recording of one mitosis of a syncytial blastoderm stage _Drosophila_ embryo expressing a GFP-histone gene that labels chromatin.

Tracking is done by first segmenting objects then linking objects between consecutive frames. Linking is done by matching objects and several criteria or matching rules are available. Here we will link objects if they significantly overlap between the current and previous frames.

>  * Modules used by the pipeline aren't available in Galaxy.
>  * Parameters for some CellProfiler modules are limited/constrained compared to the stand-alone version, most notably:
>    - Parameters require manual input from the user whereas, in the stand-alone version, some modules can inherit parameter values from other modules.
>    - Input and output file locations are set by Galaxy and can't be set by the user.
>    - Metadata extraction from file names is limited to a set of fixed patterns.

# Get data

This tutorial will use a time-lapse recording of nuclei progressing through mitotic anaphase during early _Drosophila_ embryogenesis. The nuclei are labelled on chromatin with a GFP-histone marker and have been imaged every 7 seconds using a laser scanning confocal microscope with a 40X objective.
The images are saved as a zip archive on Zenodo and need to be uploaded to the Galaxy server before they can be used.

# Create a CellProfiler pipeline in Galaxy

In this section, we will build a CellProfiler pipeline from scratch in Galaxy.
We need to:
  - Read the images and the metadata
  - Convert the colour images to grayscale
  - Segment the nuclei
  - Extract features from the segmented nuclei
  - Perform tracking
  - Produce some useful output files

A pipeline is built by chaining together Galaxy tools representing CellProfiler modules and must start with the {% tool [Starting modules](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/cp_common/cp_common/3.1.9+galaxy1) %} tool and end with the {% tool [CellProfiler](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/cp_cellprofiler/cp_cellprofiler/3.1.9+galaxy0) %}  tool.

![Image of the workflow](../../images/object-tracking-using-cell-profiler/CP_object_tracking_pipeline.png "Overview of the CellProfiler pipeline using Galaxy tools.")


> <details-title>More details about the pipeline steps</details-title>
>    - Metadata is needed to tell CellProfiler what a temporal sequence of images is and what the order of images is in the sequence.
>    - CellProfiler is designed to work primarily with grayscale images. Since we don't need the colour information, we convert colour images to grayscale type.
>    - Segmentation means identifying the nuclei in each image. In CellProfiler, this is done by thresholding the intensity level in each image.
>    - When we perform tracking we're usually interested in quantifying how some properties of the objects evolve over time. Also, sometimes we may want to do tracking by matching objects based on some property of the objects (e.g. a shape measurement). Therefore, for each segmented object, we compute some features, i.e. numerical descriptors of some properties of the object.
>    - Tracking will provide the information required to allow downstream data analysis tools to link the features into a multidimensional time series.

## Feature extraction

Once the objects of interest (nuclei) are identified, we extract features, i.e. numerical descriptors of object properties. We do this because we may be interested in analysing the evolution of these properties over time or want to use them in the tracking procedure to match objects over time.

# Conclusion


We've run a CellProfiler pipeline on Galaxy to segment and track dividing nuclei in a Drosophila embryo. We've exported images to visually inspect the outcome and saved tables of computed object features in comma-separated text files for future analysis.
