# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

`recetox-aplcms` is a software package designed for peak detection and related pre-processing in high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data.
It supports reading `.mzml` files in raw profile mode and uses a bi-Gaussian chromatographic peak shape ({% cite yu2010quantification %}) for feature detection and quantification. `recetox-aplcms` is based on the apLCMS R package ({% cite 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp291 %}) and includes various software updates and is actively developed and maintained on GitHub.

There are two major routes of data analysis. The first, which we call **unsupervised** analysis, does not use existing knowledge. It detects peaks de novo from the data based on the data itself. The second, which we call **hybrid** analysis, combines de novo peak detection with existing knowledge. The existing knowledge can come from two sources - known metabolites and historically detected features from the same machinery. While the unsupervised approach allows for unbiased exploration and discovery of patterns, the hybrid approach integrates prior knowledge or supervised techniques to enhance targeted analysis and interpretation. The choice between these approaches depends on the research objectives, available prior knowledge, and the specific questions being addressed in the metabolomics study.

![recetox-aplcms overview](../../images/aplcms_scheme.png "Overview of individual steps of the recetox-aplcms package that can be combined in two separate workflows processing HRMS data in an unsupervised manner or by including a-priori knowledge.")

The workflows consist of the following building blocks:

- **remove noise** - denoise the raw data and extract the EIC
- **generate feature table** - group features in EIC into peaks using peak-shape model
- **compute clusters** - compute mz and rt clusters across samples
- **compute template** - find the template for rt correction
- **correct time** - correct the rt across samples using splines
- **align features** - align identical features across samples
- **recover weaker signals** - recover missed features in samples based on the aligned features
- **merge known table** - add known features to the detected features table and vice versa

We use three GC-[EI+] high-resolution mass spectrometry data files generated from quality control seminal plasma samples to demonstrate data analysis in this tutorial.

The three samples used in this training are pooled quality control (QC) samples coming from about 200 samples. The pooled samples were analyzed in dilution series to test the system suitability and the quality of the assay.

# Data preparation and prepocessing

Prior to commencing the analysis pipeline, the dataset must be downloaded and prepared. Several preprocessing steps can be executed in parallel on individual samples. To facilitate this process, utilizing Galaxy's Dataset collections is recommended. When uploading data into Galaxy, you can select to create the dataset collection directly.

## Import the data into Galaxy

As a result of this step, we should have in our history a green Dataset collection with three `.raw` files as well as the table of known metabolites.

## Convert the raw data to mzML

Our input data are in `.raw` format, which is not suitable for the downstream tools in this tutorial. We use the tool {% tool [msconvert](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/galaxyp/msconvert/msconvert/3.0.20287.2) %} to convert our samples to the appropriate format (`.mzML` in this case).

> <hands-on-title> Convert the raw data to mzML </hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [msconvert](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/galaxyp/msconvert/msconvert/3.0.20287.2) %} with the following parameters:

>    - *"Do you agree to the vendor licenses?"*: `Yes`
>    - *"Output Type"*: `mzML`
>
{: .hands_on}

After conversion, you can inspect the `mzML` file by clicking the **eye** button on the history dataset to check if your data is still in profile mode.
If so, you should fine the following line the header of each scan.

# Common part

In this first part, `recetox-aplcms` integrates noise filtering, peak detection and alignment, and statistical analysis to process and extract meaningful information from LC-MS data. To enhance the quality of the data, the tool employs noise filtering techniques to remove false-positive peaks caused by background noise. It applies statistical methods or threshold-based approaches to distinguish true peaks from the noise. 

Then, `recetox-aplcms` detects and extracts individual peaks from the noise-free data. It uses an adaptive algorithm that iteratively identifies peaks by considering the local intensity distributions. Once the peaks are detected, they are grouped based on their chromatographic behaviour across multiple samples. It aligns the peaks by accounting for variations in retention time, which can occur due to instrument drift or other factors. This is achieved by retention time correction, when the tool estimates retention time shifts based on peak intensities and their alignment patterns, iteratively adjusting the retention time values to minimize misalignment and maximize the alignment of peaks with similar chromatographic behaviour. Finally, by considering retention time, m/z values, and peak intensities, `recetox-aplcms` matches corresponding features, ensuring their accurate alignment and enabling meaningful comparisons.

## Remove noise

This step extracts an ion chromatogram (EIC) showing the intensity of only particular ions of interest over time.
Since the intensity is dropping over time in the experiment, we want to normalise this and remove noise from the raw data.
It also performs a first clustering step of points with close m/z values into the extracted ion chromatograms (EICs).

> <details-title> Key parameters </details-title>
> 
> A precise tuning of input parameters is crucial in this step since it can potentially lead to the elimination of some of the data of interest or, on the other extreme, the preservance of some noisy background data:
>
> - **Minimal elution time** - minimal length of elution time of a peak to be actually recognised as a peak. It is closely related to the chromatography method used. Only peaks with greater elution length are kept.
> - **Minimal signal presence** - determines in how many consequent scans do we want to have the signal present. Sometimes the signal from a real feature is not present 100% of the time along the feature's retention time. This parameter sets the threshold for an ion trace to be considered a feature. This parameter is best determined by examining the raw data. For example, if we know a data point shows up only every three scans for 10 seconds, this setting can be used to filter it out.
> - **m/z tolerance** - tolerance (in ppm) to determine how far along m/z do two points need to be separated for them to be considered different a different peak. It can be seen as the width of the m/z peak.
> - **Baseline correction** - intensity cutoff to be used. After grouping the observations, the highest intensity in each group is found. If the highest is lower than this value, the entire group will be deleted.

## Generate feature table

This step takes the features grouped by m/z from the previous step and detects peaks. The goal is to fit peak shapes in the retention time domain to our data, which allows computing precise intensities by integrating the peak area. This step also resolves peak overlaps by fitting them both as separate peaks. As a consequence of this approach, `recetox-aplcms` does not work with centroid data since there are no peak shapes anymore, just some "averages" of them.

> <details-title> Key parameters </details-title>
> 
> - **Minimal/maximal standard deviation** - specify the maximum and minimum peak width by selecting the allowed range for the standard deviation (both $$\sigma_1$$ and $$\sigma_2$$).
> - **Minimal/maximal sigma ratio** - the lower and upper limit of the ratio between left-standard deviation and the right-standard deviation $$\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2}$$. It represents the relative skewness of the peak.
> - **Bandwidth factor** - parameter used to scale down the overall range of retention times (the bandwidth) assumed in the kernel smoother used for peak identification. The value is between zero and one. The minimal and maximal bandwidth can be limited by explicit values. It is used to improve the peak shape by smoothing.

## Compute clusters

The pre-alignment step, where we put all peaks from all samples into a single table and group them based on both m/z and rt. The tool takes a collection of all detected features and computes the clusters over a global feature table, adding the `sample_id` and `cluster` (shared across samples) columns to the table. This process is parametrised by influencing the "size" of buckets (clusters) using relative m/z tolerance and retention time tolerance.

> <details-title> Clustering algorithm details </details-title>
> 
> Features are first grouped in m/z dimension based on the relative m/z tolerance. Then, the absolute tolerance is computed for each feature and a new group is separated once the difference between consecutive features is above this threshold. The same process is then repeated for the retention time dimension. The individual indices are then combined into a single index in the `cluster` columns.

Output is again separated into a collection of individual tables but with assigned `cluster`.

## Compute template

To continue with further steps, we need a template into which we can align the data - this means a peak table which has the highest number of features, consequently giving us the highest number of reference points we fit our curve to. This step can be potentially skipped if you want to select a template manually or provide a custom file used in further steps.

**TODO** add hint how to select single file from collection as input for a tool

## Correct time

We need our previously clustered features and selected template.
Apply spline-based retention time correction to a feature table given the template table and the mz and rt tolerances.

> <details-title> Retention time correction effects </details-title>
> 
> The retention time alignment starts by grouping features based on their m/z values using a lenient m/z tolerance. Kernel density estimation is applied to the m/z values within each group to identify multiple modes and split the group accordingly. Next, a retention-time cutoff is determined using a model-based search. Retention time differences are calculated between features within each m/z group. The differences are combined, and a density estimation is performed.
>
> A threshold is determined by finding the largest distance where the observed density exceeds 1.5 times the fitted value. If any spacing in retention time is larger than the threshold, feature groups with similar m/z values are further divided.
> 
> The alignment is performed by selecting one profile as the template (one with the most number of features) and aligning all other profiles against it using a kernel smoother. Adjustments are made to the retention times based on the alignment results, and for features outside the range, their retention times are adjusted with the same amount as the nearest endpoint of the alignment.

## Features alignment

This step performs feature alignment after clustering and retention time correction. The peaks clustered across samples are grouped based on the given tolerances to create an aligned feature table, connecting identical features across samples. Among tolerances, the `Minimal occurrence in samples` parameter can be used to control at least in how many samples a feature has to be detected in order to be included in the aligned feature table. This allows us to preserve only peaks that appear really consistently across the samples.

> <details-title> Algorithm details </details-title>
> 
> To properly align features, we repeat the model-based search to determine the retention time cutoff and group features accordingly. Within each feature group, we employ kernel density estimators to assess the m/z and retention time dimensions, potentially leading to further divisions within the group. The resulting groups represent aligned features across all profiles. From each group, we extract the median m/z and median retention time as representative characteristic values for the features. This information is recorded in an aligned feature table (for practical purposes, separated into three tables), which includes the median m/z, median retention time, m/z range, and intensities in each profile for every feature.

# Unsupervised

The unsupervised approach focuses on exploring and discovering patterns in the data without prior knowledge or assumptions. This method employs techniques such as dimensionality reduction and clustering to reveal inherent structures and relationships within the metabolite profiles. The unsupervised approach is useful when the specific patterns or classes within the data are not known beforehand, allowing for unbiased exploration of the data and potential identification of novel patterns or subgroups. However, the unsupervised approach may require additional validation and annotation steps to assign biological meaning to the discovered patterns.

## Recover weaker signals

This step recovers features which are present in a sample but might have been filtered out initially as noise due to low signal intensity. It runs the second stage of peak detection based on the aligned feature table from the feature alignment step. If a feature is contained in the aligned feature table, this step revisits the raw data and searches for this feature at the retention time obtained by mapping the corrected retention time back to the original sample.

> <details-title> Gaps in the feature table </details-title>
>
> After inspecting the obtained metadata table, we can observe that many columns indicating the presence of the feature in the sample are empty (resp., there is a zero). The same holds for respective positions in intensity and retention time tables. That basically means we lost some information for metabolites that did not pass the noise filter and were not included in the feature table during LC/MS profiling. However, that does not necessarily mean they are not present in the samples. To double-check this, we revisit the data and try to recover them.
> 
> The recovery process involves sequentially examining each LC/MS profile. Firstly, an interpolating spline is used to adjust the retention times in the aligned feature table to match the specific profile. Secondly, for features in the aligned table with zero values in the profile, a search is conducted within a smaller region around their m/z and retention time locations. This region is narrower than the range defined by the m/z and retention time across other profiles. Noise filtering is not applied during this step. If one or more features are detected within this region, the feature most consistent with the parameters in the feature table is considered the missed feature, and its intensity replaces the zero value in the aligned feature table.

# Hybrid

The hybrid approach combines unsupervised techniques with supervised or targeted methods. This approach incorporates external information, such as known metabolic pathways or class labels, to guide the analysis and interpretation of the data. The hybrid approach may leverage prior knowledge to enhance the detection and interpretation of specific metabolite classes, pathways, or biomarkers of interest. The hybrid approach is particularly valuable when there is prior knowledge available or when targeted analysis is desired.

## Merge known table

This step allows us to incorporate the knowledge of known metabolites or historically detected features on the same machinery to help detect and quantify lower-intensity peaks. The features we have found so far are merged with the data frame of known features. Then we will recover the weaker signals and repeat all the previous steps. Finally, the data frame of known metabolites and historical features is updated with the new information from the measured data.

> <details-title> Known table with example </details-title>
> 
> The known table can contain these columns: *chemical_formula*, *HMDB_ID*, *KEGG_compound_ID*, *mass*, *ion.type* (the ion form), *m.z* (either theoretical or mean observed m/z value of previously found features), *Number_profiles_processed* (the total number of processed samples to build this database), *Percent_found* (the percentage of historically processed samples in which the feature appeared), *mz_min* (minimum observed m/z value), *mz_max* (maximum observed m/z value), *RT_mean* (mean observed retention time), *RT_sd* (standard deviation of observed retention time), *RT_min* (minimum observed retention time), *RT_max* (maximum observed retention time), *int_mean.log* (mean observed log intensity), *int_sd.log* (standard deviation of observed log intensity), *int_min.log* (minimum observed log intensity), *int_max.log* (maximum observed log intensity).
