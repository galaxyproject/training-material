# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

MsPurity paper authors ({% cite Lawson2017%}) said “mass spectrometry (MS) is routinely used to quantify, annotate, and identify small molecules in complex biological matrices.[..] Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS or MS/MS) is a widely used approach for structural annotation and identification of metabolites in complex biological samples”. MS is used to generate theoretical formula for a metabolite of interest while MS/MS provides additional information regarding molecular structure and chemical groups. Authors also highlight the key point of MS/MS : “the term “tandem mass spectrometry” is used when a single collision step is used, but product ions can be isolated for further collision to provide MSn spectra where n ≥ 3. A key component of any MS/MS (or higher) technology is the isolation of selected m/z windows for gas-phase fragmentation and the mapping back of the fragmentation (product) spectrum to the selected m/z window”.

This previous paper deals with a metabolomics analytical and data analysis workflow that directly takes into consideration the purity of an isolation window by using the msPurity package. “The approach, demonstrated using an Agilent6520 Q-TOF instrument, requires sliding isolation windows to be acquired surrounding the precursor of interest.[...] In these cases, simply assessing the targeted precursor purity can be useful in interpreting the MS/MS spectra and aid in assessing the reliability of any subsequent annotation. [...] What we call here “precursor purity” is calculated with a revised Michalski approach”. The software has been applied to investigate DDA (Data Dependant Acquisition) or DIA (Data Independent Acquisition) metabolomics data sets for different biological samples retrieved from the data repositories MetaboLights, Metabolomics Workbench, and PRIMeData Resource of Plant Metabolomics (DROP Met). They also detail how theoretical isolation windows can be assessed using MS1 data sets collected independent of MS/MS acquisitions. The computational methods detailed in the msPurity paper (Lawson et al. 2017) are available in the R package msPurity. The package has been developed to work as a standalone or to be used in conjunction with the metabolomics peak detection and processing R package XCMS 2.0.
{: .text-justify}

The present tutorial  illustrates this approach with data from [*Metabolights n°307*](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS307), extracted from {% cite VanDerHooft2016%}. The aim of this paper is “to detect and visualize antihypertensive drug metabolites in untargeted metabolomics experiments based on the spectral similarity of their fragmentation spectra” ({% cite Lawson2017%}). To do so, the authors collected urines from a cohort of 26 patients and samples were analysed with a pHILIC column coupled to a Thermo Q-Exactive instrument. Authors found 165 separated metabolites from 7 parents drugs and during this tutorial we will only focuse to find each of these parents. For time reasons, we will just used a subset of samples. We should not find all these waiting metabolites because of the data complexity.
{: .text-justify}

To analyze these data, we will start by following a light version of the [LC-MS workflow](http://workflow4metabolomics.org/the-lc-ms-workflow), developed by the [Wokflow4metabolomics group](http://workflow4metabolomics.org/) ({% cite Giacomoni2014 %}, {% cite Guitton2017 %}), then we will be able to complete the MS/MS workflow developed by **msPurity** authors ({% cite Lawson2017%}).

# Preprocessing with XCMS

The first step of the workflow is the pre-processing of the raw data with **XCMS** ({% cite Smith2006 %}).
{: .text-justify}

**XCMS** is a free and open source software dedicated to pre-processing of any type of mass spectrometry acquisition files from low to high resolution, including FT-MS data coupled with different kind of chromatography (liquid or gas). This software is used worldwide by a huge community of specialists in metabolomics using mass spectrometry methods.
{: .text-justify}

This software is based on different algorithms that have been published, and is provided and maintained using R software.
{: .text-justify}

**MSnbase readMSData** {% icon tool %} function, prior to **XCMS**, is able to read files with open format as `mzXML`, `mzML`, `mzData` and `netCDF`, which are independent of the constructors' formats. The **XCMS** package itself is composed of R functions able to extract, filter, align and fill gap, with the possibility to annotate isotopes, adducts and fragments (using the R package CAMERA, {% cite CAMERA %}). This set of functions gives modularity, and thus is particularly well adapted to define workflows, one of the key points of Galaxy.
{: .text-justify}

First step of this tutorial is to download the data test. As describe in the introduction, we will use data from {% cite VanDerHooft2016 %}. We will only process on a subset of these data. So, you can **import your files directly in Galaxy by using the following URLs below** or download files into your computer (then upload them on Galaxy) :

This step is described as number 1 in details part below.

Then, to be able to process your MS/MS datas, we need to **start with the peakpicking of MS datas**. One Galaxy Training already explains how to process with your MS datas. You should **follow this link and complete this tutorial** : [Mass spectrometry: LC-MS analysis](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/metabolomics/tutorials/lcms/tutorial.html). For MS/MS analysis you **don't really need to finish** this previous tutorial but for a better understanding of your datas, it is recommanded. In this tutorial, you **just have to compute** your datas with the **following steps** briefly describe in the *details* part below (please follow parameters values to have the same results during the training).

# Stopover : Verify your data after the XCMS preprocessing

When you have process **all or only needed** steps described before, you can continue with the MS/MS processing part with **msPurity** package. Don't forget to always check your files format ! For the next step you need to have this file `xset.merged.groupChromPeaks.*.RData` where * is the name of **optionnal** steps you could do during the pre-processing. For our example, your file should be named `xset.merged.groupchromPeaks.RData`. 
{: .text-justify}

> ### {% icon comment %} Comment

> The preprocessing part of this analysis can be **quite time-consuming**, and already corresponds to quite a few number of steps, depending of your analysis. We highly recommend, at this step of the MS/MS workflow, to split your analysis by beginning a new Galaxy history with **only the files you need** (final xset Rdata file and your data collection of mzML). This will help you in limiting selecting the wrong dataset in further analysis, and bring a little **tidiness** for future review of your MS/MS analysis process. You should also be able to make a better peakpicking in the future in the same history and it will not be polluated by MS/MS part of your process.

# Processing with msPurity package

**msPurity** is a R package developed by Birmingham University team and published in 2017 ({% cite Lawson2017 %}). It is also available via Galaxy instance through some [wrappers](https://github.com/computational-metabolomics/mspurity-galaxy/tree/master) that were developped by the same people. 
{: .text-justify}

This R package was developed to :
  - Assess the contribution of the targeted precursor of acquired fragmentation spectra by checking isolation windows using a metric called “precursor ion purity”
  - Assess the anticipated precursor ion purity of XCMS LC-MS features where no fragmentation has been acquired
  - Map fragmentation spectra to XCMS LC-MS features
  - Filter and average MS/MS spectra from an LC-MS/MS dataset
  - Create a spectral-database of LC-MS(/MS) data and associated annotations
  - Perform spectral matching of query MS/MS spectra against library MS/MS spectra
  - Export fragmentation spectra to MSP format


**What is *precursor ion purity*?** 

They call "**precursor ion purity** the measure of the contribution of a selected precursor peak in an isolation window used for fragmentation. The simple calculation involves dividing the intensity of the selected precursor peak by the total intensity of the isolation window. When assessing MS/MS spectra this calculation is done before and after the MS/MS scan of interest and the **purity is interpolated at the recorded time of the MS/MS acquisition**.[...] Additionally, low abundance ions that are remove that are thought to have limited contribution to the resulting MS/MS spectra and the isolation efficiency of the mass spectrometer can be used to normalise the contributing ions to metric."
{: .text-justify}

There are 3 main classes used in msPurity :

  - purityA :
    - Assessing precursor purity of previously acquired MS/MS spectra: A user has acquired either LC-MS/MS or DIMS/MS spectra and an assessment is made of the precursor purity for each MS/MS scan. Further processing of the purityA object include - fragmentation spectra filtering, averaging, MSP creation, spectral-database creation and spectral matching.
    {: .text-justify}
  - purityX :
    - Assessing precursor purity of anticipated isolation windows for LC-MS/MS spectra. i.e. a user has acquired from an LC-MS full scan (MS1) data and an assessment is to be made of the precursor purity of detected features using anticipated or theoretical isolation windows. This information can then be used to guide further targeted MS/MS experiments.
    {: .text-justify}
  - purityD :
    - Assessing precursor purity of anticipated isolation windows for DIMS/MS spectra. Also provides some basic functionality to process DIMS spectra.
    {: .text-justify}

During our tutorial we will used the purityA class because we have files containing MS/MS spectra and MS data directly.

## 1 - Assessing the purity

The importance of **assessing the contribution of the precursor ion** within an isolation window for MS/MS experiments has been previously detailed in proteomics, where precursor ion purity influences the quality and accuracy of matching to mass spectral libraries. But to date, there has been little attention to this data-processing technique in metabolomics. In **targeted and data-dependent acquisition** (DDA)-based experiments, where MS/MS is performed on a dynamic list of precursor ions (as often determined by a preceding MS full scan), an isolation window is centered on the targeted precursor peak (m/z value). However, the **isolation window** can often contain **more than one distinct peak**. Fragmentation spectra resulting from these situations being termed *“chimeric”* and can be problematic for interpretation of the spectra and mass spectral library searching.
{: .text-justify}

The precursor purity metric is calculated as *“intensity of a selected precursor divided by the summed intensity of the isolation window”*. The impact of chimeric spectra on spectral matching and annotation depends on **the purity of the isolation window fragmented** (i.e., the ratio between the relative intensity of the precursor divided by the summed intensity of all ions within the isolation window). If the purity of the precursor ion is sufficiently low, it can often **be difficult to determine the origin of the resulting product ion(s)**. This in turn can lead to erroneous spectral matching results or no spectral matches. Deconvolution of chimeric spectra however is possible and forms the basis of the data-analysis procedures applied to data independent acquisition (DIA) experiments.

> ### {% icon comment %} How the purityA algorithm works ?
> 
> Just given a vector of LC-MS/MS file paths and the **precursor ion purity** of each MS/MS scan from each file can be calculated. It then stores in the purityA S4 class object where **a dataframe of the purity results** can be accessed using the appropriate slot (*pa@puritydf*). The **calculation** involves dividing the intensity of the selected precursor peak by the total intensity of the isolation window. It is performed before and after the MS/MS scan of interest and interpolated at the recorded time of the MS/MS acquisition.

> Additionally, isotopic peaks can estimated and **omitted** from the calculation. Low abundance peaks are **removed** that are thought to have limited contribution to the resulting MS/MS spectra. The isolation efficiency of the mass spectrometer can be used to **normalise** the intensities used for the calculation. The **precursor ion purity** represents the measure of the contribution of a selected precursor peak in an isolation window used for fragmentation and can be used as away of assessing the spectral quality and level of "contamination" of fragmentation spectra.

The output is a RData file with the purityA S4 class object (referred to as *pa* for convenience throughout the manual). The object contains a slot (pa@puritydf) where we can find the details of the purity assessments for each MS/MS scan. The purityA object can then be used for further processing including linking the fragmentation spectra to XCMS features, averaging fragmentation, database creation and spectral matching (from the created database).
There is also the additional output which is a tsv file of the purity assessment dataframe.

## 2 - Match features with fragmentation spectra

The `frag4feature` function from msPurity package will link the fragmentation spectra (MS/MS) back to the XCMS features. This function matches precursor ions of MS/MS datas with features and stores them into a new table. To be able to be matched, the associated acquisition time of the MS/MS event has to be **within the retention time window** defined for the individual peaks associated and the precursor m/z value also has to be **within the user ppm tolerance** to XCMS feature. 
{: .text-justify}

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on : msPurity.frag4feature {% icon tool %}
>
> Just find the **msPurity.frag4feature** {% icon tool %} tool in the Galaxy instance to be able to run this function. As result, it will give you all your MS/MS datas which have a good precursor found during the XCMS processus. But before, you have to enter the right parameters: 
> {: .text-justify}
>  - **xcmsSet object** : the Rdata file you made during the XCMS preprocessing. Its name should be `xset.merged.groupChromPeaks.fillChromPeaks.RData` (or your new name if your rename it).
> {: .text-justify}
>  - **purityA object** : the RData file ouputed the step before containing all your MS/MS spectra. Should be named `msPurity.purityA_on_yourdata.RData`.
> {: .text-justify}
>  - **ppm error tolerance between precursor mz and XCMS feature mz** : fragmentation will be ignored if the precursor m/z value is not within the ppm tolerance to the XCMS feature m/z. Please `set it to 10` (default).
> {: .text-justify}
>  - **Should the most intense precursor be used within the isolation window?** : if you set it to "yes", the most intense precursor will be used. If it is on "no" the precursor closest the center of the isolation window will be used. Please `set it to "yes"`.
> {: .text-justify}
>  - **Was retention time correction used?** : just `precise if you used retention time correction` when you made the XCMS preprocessing. It is an optionnal step so maybe you have not made it.
> {: .text-justify}
>  - **For matching fragmentation to a feature, use the grouped feature range** : XCMS has already calculated individual peaks for each file, then it has grouped them together. If your MS/MS files have also MS datas, you can link MS/MS spectra directly to a peak for each file. In this case, you can turn this parameter to "no". If you don't have any MS datas in each file, you can turn it to "yes". In this case, the full width of the grouped peaks will be used to link MS/MS spectra with it. In our case, please `set it to "no"`, we have enough MS datas in our files.

## 3 - Filter your results

The fragmentation result can be filtered prior to averaging using the `filterFragSpectra` function. You can filter your features according to different parameters : 
{: .text-justify}
 - **precursor ion purity** : you can filter by enter the value that will be the threshold for the precursor ion purity value. Each MS/MS spectra with a precursor ion purity under this threshold will be tagged as *false* or will be removed.
 {: .text-justify}
 - **peak intensity** : you can fix a minimum for the peak intensity. All peaks under this value will be tagged or removed.
 {: .text-justify}
 - **relative abundance** : the relative abundance is calculated for each peak in the window. You can select a value that will be the minimum requiered as relative abundance. Every peak under this value will be removed or flagged. 
 {: .text-justify}
 - **signal-to-noise** : the ratio of a peak signal to the noise is calculated for each peak of a file. You can enter the minimum signa-to-noise ratio that will removed (or flagged) all peaks under this value. 
 {: .text-justify}

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on : msPurity.filterFragSpectra {% icon tool %}
>
> This function is used in **msPurity.filterFragSpectra {% icon tool %}** from Galaxy instance. It is an optionnal step of the process but we can make some tries to refine our MS/MS spectra and have a little bit less than thousands we had. Here is an example with the different parameters you have to complete to make a selection of your matched MS/MS spectra : 
> {: .text-justify}
>  - **purityA object with fragmentation linked to XCMS features** : file output from msPurity.frag4feature {% icon tool %} tool. It should be named `msPurity.frag4feature_on_yourdata.RData`.

>  {: .text-justify}
>  - **Peak instensity threshold** : minimum intensity of a peak. `Keep it at 0`.
>  {: .text-justify}
>  - **Relative abundance threshold** : minimum relative abundance of a peak. `Keep it at 0`.

>  {: .text-justify}
>
{: .hands_on}

## 4 - Average your results

The fragmentation spectra can be averaged in multiple ways : 
  - `averageIntraFragSpectra` will average fragmentation spectra **within a file**.
  - `averageInterFragSpectra` will average fragmentation spectra **across files** (but *intra need to be done first*).
  - `averageAllFragSpectra` will average **all** spectra **ignoring the intra and inter relationships**.

The way you make the average will depend of the user wishes to treat its fragmentation spectra. Another alternative is to ignore the averaging completely and just use the non-averaged fragmentation spectra for the spectral matching.
{: .text-justify}

> ### {% icon warning %} Be careful to process the averaging ?

## 5 - Create your MSP file

This is the last step of the msPurity part. This **msPurity.createMSP {% icon tool %} tool** can construct a `msp` file from our `RData` file outputted from matching or averaging. So, all the fragmentation spectra that has been linked to an XCMS feature are export with their own informations. 

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on : msPurity.createMSP {% icon tool %}
>
> This tool has some parameters to complete and each one is important depending to our datas and our process made before. So four our tutorial, we need the following parameters : 
>   - **msPurity purityA dataset** : this is the RData file outputted from our msPurity part we have done. The file should be named `msPurity.averageFragSpectra(all)_on_your_data.RData`.
>   - **How to choose fragmentation spectra (if precursor was fragmented in >1 scans per XCMS group feature)** : here you have to adjust your choice according to the process you made before during averaging part. For our tutorial `select "average(all)"` to have all your datas you averaged. 
>   - **Use additional metadata?** : choose if you use additional metadata for the `msp` file. If "yes" you have to add a dataframe containing a column with the "grpid" of each peak you want to complete. But for our tutorial `keep it to "no"`.
>   - **Select XCMS groups?** : choose if you want to select some peaks. If "yes" you have to enter each grpid you want separated by comas. But for our tutorial `keep it to "no"`.
>   - **Include intensity, relative abundance or both in the MSP file** : in the `msp` file you will have the spectra with values of m/z and you can choose the intensity or the relative abundance. For our tutorial `just keep the default values`.
>   - **MSP schema to use for files** : choose the schema you want for your `msp` file. You have 2 options : MAssBank or MoNa. For the tutorial `keep the default parameter`.
>   - **Filter peaks that have been flagged in prior processing steps** : during the filtering step some peaks can have been flagged because they didn't respect threshold or parameters we completed. Here you have to choose if you want to keep or not this flagged peaks. For the tutorial `keep it to "yes"` to filter these flagged peaks.
>   - **Always include the following adduct descriptions in the MSP file** : if you want to check some adducts, select them in the list. For our tutorial `keep it empty` to have the default adduct [M+H]+.
>   - **Create MSP spectra for each adduct?** : here you choose if you want one file per adduct. You should `keep it to "yes"` to have different file for different adducts.
>
{: .hands_on}

So when you look at your output, you should have something like this : 
![MSP file example](../../images/tutorial_msms_msp_example.png "MSP file example (MassBank format)")

- *RECORD_TITLE* : the title given for this peak. **msPurity** take informations about its mass (MZ), retention time (RT), group id (grpid), file, adduct and compile all of them to build the name. 
{: .text-justify}
- *MS$FOCUSED_ION* : the exact mass of the precursor.
{: .text-justify}
- *AC$CHROMATOGRAPHY* : the exact retention time of the precursor.
{: .text-justify}
- *XCMS groupid (grpid)* : the group id in which the precursor has been classed.
{: .text-justify}
- *COMMENT* : some words about how we obtained this peak and which tool we used to.
{: .text-justify}
- *PK$NUM_PEAK* : number of peaks in the MS/MS spectra.
{: .text-justify}
- *PK$PEAK* : the column names of the list of peaks containing in the MS/MS spectra, follow by all the peaks in lines below.  
{: .text-justify}

We can now use this file to make our annotation with different software like *MetFrag*, *Sirius CSI-Finger-ID*, etc.... This can be done on Galaxy (and describe later in this tutorial) or you can also take informations directly in your `msp` file and work peak by peak in [this website](https://msbi.ipb-halle.de/MetFragBeta/ "MetFrag web version") for example.
{: .text-justify}

## 6 - (Optionnal) Create a database

This function can be used to create an SQLite database for the LC-MS/MS example experiment. It can be done just after the averaging to be sure that we will create the database of our spectra already sorted. 
The SQLite schema of the spectral database can be detailed here : 

![Full schema of the database it will create ](../../images/tutorial_msms_DB_createDatabase.png "Full schema of the database created by this tool")

## 7 - (Optionnal) Matching of databases
  
Firstly, this function is coupled and must be executed after the previous **msPurity.createDatabase {% icon tool %}** tool. Indeed, this **msPurity.spectralMatching {% icon tool %}** tool allows the matching between the just created database and an other one.  

So, the first one is a query SQLite database which should contain the *"unknown"* spectral database generated by the **msPurity.createDatabase {% icon tool %}** tool as part of the data processing workflow.  
The second database is the spectral database of the library must contain the *“known”* spectra coming from public resources or generated by the users. The SQLite library database defaults to MoNA data, including Massbank, HMDB, LipidBlast and GNPS. A larger database can be downloaded from here??????????.
  
To create a user generated library SQLite database the following tool can be used to generate a SQLite database from a collection of MSP files: `msp2db` ([see on Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/msp2db/)). Unfortunatelly, this tool is not available on W4M Galaxy yet. It should be noted though, that as long as the schema of the spectral-database is as described here, then any database can be used for either the library or query - even allowing for the same database to be used. 
  
The spectral matching functionality includes four main components : 
  - spectral filtering : spectral filtering simply filters both the library and the query spectra to search (for example, choosing the source of the library, the instrument, the retention time, the PPM tolerance of the precursor, etc.).
  - spectral alignment : this step involves aligning the query peaks with the library peaks. The approach used is similar to the modified pMatch algorithm described in Zhou et al 2015.
  - spectral matching : the spectral matching of the aligned spectra is performed against a combined intensity and a weighted vector m/z - created for the query and library spectra (wq and wl). See below: ```w = intensity^x ∗ mz^y```. Where x and y represent the weight factors, by default to `x = 0.5 and y = 2` according to MassBank. These can however be adjusted by the user. The aligned weighted vectors are then matched using the cosine of the dot product, the cosine of the inverse dot product, and the composite dot product. See below for the cosine equation of the dot product. ```dpc = wq ∗ wl / √(∑wq^2) ∗ √(∑wl^2)```.

# Stopover : Verify your datas after the msPurity processing
  

You have now finish the msPurity package part. Like in the previous stopover, we will verify your files to know if you have done msPurity steps correctly. This package has a function named "createMSP" which is installed as tool in Galaxy. With this, you obtained a `msp` format file which contains each saved MS/MS fragmentation spectra and its peaks. For the annotation step, we will need this `msp` file as input for each tool we will want to use. 

The `msp` file should contains lines like these repeated for each spectra and its precursor : 

```

# Annotation

## With MetFrag

MetFrag is a software developped by PheNoMeNal team and which is freely available. It is used for the annotation of high precision tandem mass spectra of metabolites which is a first and critical step for the identification of a molecule's structure. Candidate molecules of different databases are fragmented in silico and matched against mass to charge values. A score calculated using the fragment peak matches gives hints to the quality of the candidate spectrum assignment. MetFrag can be easily used via the web tool but it can also be processed by the commandline version or the R package for the R programming language. 
A tool has been developped on Galaxy instance and is available on W4M Galaxy. With this tool, you can continue the previous steps we have done during this tutorial. 
{: .text-justify}

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on : MetFrag {% icon tool %}
> This tool is named **MetFrag** {% icon tool %} in Galaxy instance. It is the principal step of annotation after the msPurity part. To link these two parts, we already saw the **msPurity.createMSP** {% icon tool %} tool which able us to obtain a MSP file where we have all our interesting masses link to their spectrum and informations. So to run the metfrag tool, we need to set up these parameters for the tutorial : 
>  - **MSP file (Output from Create MSP tool)** : it is the file outputed from createMSP tool and containing all your spectra and their informations. For the tutorial you should have the **msPurity.createMSP_on_data_x:msp** file.
>  - **Choose Compound Database** : with this parameter you can choose the database you want to compare to. There are multiple databases you can choose : *KEGG, PubChem, MetChem* or your own database if you want. For the tutorial, please **set it to KEGG** to have less possibility compare to *PubChem*. For more informations about these databases, please look at "go further" part just after.
>  - **Polarity** : just be sure the polarity parameter match with your datas. **Keep it at positive** for the tutorial because our datas are in positive mode.
>  - **MetFrag Score Types** : here you choose the differents scores you want to apply during the processing. To see what score you can obtain, just clic on *Select/Unselect all*. And to choose the score, just delete with the cross the score you don't want. For the tutorial, **just keep the FragmenterScore**
>  - **MetFrag Score Weights** : it is the weight for each score you choose in the parameter just before. For each one you add before, you need to precise the value max for this one, separate by a coma. For the tutorial, **you just need to set it to 1** because you just selected *FragmenterScore*.
>  - **Minimum number of MS/MS peaks** : you can set a threshold to the spectra on the minimum number of peaks. It can be a good process to reduce the time of the processing avoiding useless spectra. For our tutorial, **please set it to 5**.
>  - **In post-processing section** :
>    - **Threshold for score after MetFrag search** : this parameter filter results which have a better score than the threshold we fix here. It can be good to set it to have less results which will probably be some bad matches between database and spectra. For the tutorial **set it to 0.7**.
>    - **Minimum percentage of explain peaks** : during the matching part of MetFrag between database and spectra, it compare spectra peaks and database peaks. When it finds that peaks are quite the same, it adds them into explain peaks. They can probably explain something similar between database and spectra. So for the tutorial, **we would like 50% of explain peaks** in our results to have only good matches.

> > Firstable, we can see that the *clodipogrel* compound has **no reference in KEGG database**. This is due to the poor referencing of MSMS data. But it exists bigger databases that can contain this compound. Whereas the process is very longer with this king of database contrary to KEGG database where we have the principal compounds and which is **not too big to have a process running in a few time**.
> > {: .text-justify}
> > Masses in the table are **monoisotopic masses** and we have to add the mass of the adduct to be able to find the good precursor mass in our results. For example here, we just have to **add 1.007276 to the monoisotopic mass because of the adduct [M+H]+** (please take a look at [this site](https://fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/staff/kind/Metabolomics/MS-Adduct-Calculator "find your adducts")). When we have these values for each compound we are searching for these values in our results. One value can have multiple lines because the retention time can be different (mass has been found during different retention time). After that, you just have to look at the corresponding compound that matched and **verify if it corresponds to the one you are searching for**. You can also do it other way around : **searching for the compound names you want and verify if the mass correspond**. If you find something that match between mass and compound name, you have also to verify their score and their number of explain peaks. With the parameters that we completed for the processing, you should not have some bad results... 
> > {: .text-justify}
> > In our example, we can find *irbesartan* with a MZ = 429.2406 and *metformin* with MZ = 130.1089. But we only have these two compounds where we can find the name and the mass matched correctly... But if you search a little bit more, you can find that we also have some compounds with MZ = 267.1693 which is *practolol* and with mz = 152.0706 which is *acetaminophen*. The first one corresponds to the *atenolol* and the second *paracetamol*. So it is **important to know that we can have differents names for the same compound !!** 
> > {: .text-justify}
> > To resume, we have found 4 compounds : *irbesartan, metformin, practolol(atenolol), acetaminophen(paracetamol)*. 3 haven't been found : one is **not in KEGG database**, so it is normal, the 2 others are not in MetFrag result but it could be interesting to **investigate earlier in the workflow** to know if we found something about these compounds.

The first one (*clodipogrel*) **may be find in PubChem database or some other**. The two others we can try to find if we have them in our previous files of the workflow : 
>  - in the `msp` file : try to find the associated MZ for each of these not found compounds. Here we should find something around MZ = 455 and MZ = 315... Whereas we don't have anything between MZ = 446 and MZ = 464 or MZ = 314 and MZ = 316. So with the adduct [M+H]+, we don't have these 2 compounds. But maybe we can find them with a better investigation on the adduct type of these compounds.
