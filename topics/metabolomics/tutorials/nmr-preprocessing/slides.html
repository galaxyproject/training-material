## The NMR_Read tool

![Picture to show parameter values for the NMR_Read tool: the first one is the zip file including FID files; the 2nd one corresponds to the line in the title file to recover the FID names (usually in pdata/1/title); the 3rd one is a logical to indicate the Presence of subdirectories or not; the last parameter is a logical for the Use (sub)directories names as FID names or not.](../../images/nmrpreprocessing_slides_3.1.png)

![This figure illustrates how can be organized files generated by spectrometer. FID files can be organized into sub-directories, one per sample. Each sub-directory indludes the fid file and a 2nd level sub-directory with a 3rd level sub-directory inclunding a title file](../../images/nmrpreprocessing_slides_3.2.png)
