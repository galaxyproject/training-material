## The NMR preprocessing in W4M

name:pepsnmr_rpackage

## The PepsNMR R package

![Picture describing steps from the raw FID data to the preprocessed table included in the NMR_Preprocessing tool.](../../images/nmrpreprocessing_slides_2.png)

name:nmr_read

## The NMR_Read tool

![Picture to show parameter values for the NMR_Read tool: the first one is the zip file including FID files; the 2nd one corresponds to the line in the title file to recover the FID names (usually in pdata/1/title); the 3rd one is a logical to indicate the Presence of subdirectories or not; the last parameter is a logical for the Use (sub)directories names as FID names or not.](../../images/nmrpreprocessing_slides_3.1.png)

name:files_organization

## NMR_Read - directories organization

![This figure illustrates how can be organized files generated by spectrometer. FID files can be organized into sub-directories, one per sample. Each sub-directory indludes the fid file and a 2nd level sub-directory with a 3rd level sub-directory inclunding a title file.](../../images/nmrpreprocessing_slides_3.2.png)

## Phase shifs

![This slide explains reasons of phase shifts.](../../images/nmrpreprocessing_slides_4.1.png)

name:group_delay_correction

## Group delay correction

![This slide shows how phase is introduced in sprectra during aquisition and how to correct it.](../../images/nmrpreprocessing_slides_4.2.png)

---
name:group_delay_correction_illustration

## Illustration of Group delay correction

![This slide illustrates on an example the group delay introduced at the beginning of the FID and effect of correction or not on Fourier-transformed spectra.](../../images/nmrpreprocessing_slides_4.3.png)

name:solvent_suppression

## Solvent suppression

![This slide explains why solvent signals have to removend from preprocessed spectra and how solvent suppression is performed in the NMR_Preprocessing tool.](../../images/nmrpreprocessing_slides_5.1.png)

name:apodization

## Apodization

![This slide explains the aim of apodization and how this is performed in the NMR_Preprocessing tool, with some weighing functions implemented in W4M.](../../images/nmrpreprocessing_slides_6.1.png)

---
name:apodization_illustration

## Illustration of apodization

![This slide illustrates the effect on Fourier-transformed spectra of apodization using the negative exponential for weighing function and different values of line broadening.](../../images/nmrpreprocessing_slides_6.2.png)

---
name:fourier_transform

## Fourier tranform

![This slide explains the conversion of the signal in the time domain into a spectrum in the frequency domain via the Fourier transform. It also explains where the ppm scale comes from.](../../images/nmrpreprocessing_slides_7.png)

---
name:zero_order_phase

## Zero order phase correction

![This slide explains the problem of zero order phase, how to correct it and algorithms available in the NMR_Preprocessing tool.](../../images/nmrpreprocessing_slides_8.png)

---
name:referencing_to_0_illustration

## Illustration of Refrencing to 0

![This slide illustrates the effect on preprocessed spectra of the Search zone parameter used to reference spectra to 0.](../../images/nmrpreprocessing_slides_9.png)
