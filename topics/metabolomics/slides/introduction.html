## Definitions

- Metabolomics
  - Newly emerging field of 'omics' research
  - Comprehensive and simultaneous systematic determination of metabolite levels  in the metabolome and their changes over time as a consequence of stimuli
- Metabolome
  - Refers to the complete set of small-molecule metabolites
  - Dynamic
- Metabolites
  - Intermediates and products of metabolism
  - Examples include antibiotics, pigments, carbohydrates, fatty acids and amino acids
  - Primary and secondary metabolites

## Metabolomics : the world of small molecules

.pull-left[
**Physico-chemical diversity**
- Comparison with
  - ADN/ARN: 4 bases
  - Proteins: 20 amino-acids
  - Common physico-chemical propreties
  - Extraction/Analysis: easy automation

- Metabolites
  - Number ≥ 150 000 in Nature
  - Most of them not identified
  - Wide diversity of structures, functional groups, physico-chemical properties
  - ex: lipids, sugars, aminoacides, etc.)
  - High turn-over rates (&lt;sec)
  - Range from 1 pM to 100 mM
