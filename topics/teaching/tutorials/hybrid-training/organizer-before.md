- Contact and identify situable locations

    We recommend no more than 2 different time zones as the days are full.

- Identify and contact instructors

    Some recommendation: an instructor should teach at maximum half day in a row. So at least 2 instructors per day are needed.

- Choose a date in coordination with local hosts and instructors
- Create a registration form, e.g. by copying [our template](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mWl34vyXyhO-M9rwrrF0I-Kb2clSW0QHOiFTauweWv8)

    Such a registration form should include: participant details, email, affiliation, location for the workshop, accessibility requirements, motivation for participating, participation on social event, dietary requirements, agreement on privacy statement.

- Setup a webpage to advertize the event

    This page should include:
    - general information about the event, its format
    - registration details and deadline
    - draft schedule
    - what participants need to do before
    - details about the venues, including travel details, accomodation and meal suggestions
    - details about the instructors, helpers, hosts
    - sponsors (if any)

    We created a [template of such a page](https://github.com/galaxy-carpentries/workshop-template) that can easily adapted.

- Identify places you can promote your event. [Galaxy Hub](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub) or [Carpentries Discuss List](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss) are the primary places to do this

    You should do this 1-3 month in advance of your event (if you can).

- Collect contact details of the local hosts and instructors in case of last minute changes

- Arrange the schedule given the content, the instructor availability and the different time zones

    Days are usually full-days. Starting times will depend on audience, if they travel and the different time zones, and should be chosen with the local hosts.

- Identify the tool for call, e.g. [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)

- Arrange a conference call(s) with instructors and hosts in order to:
    - Meet in advance of the workshop
    - Divide and document the responsibilities
    - Share contact details
    - Test the technical infrastructure
    - Test the local set ups

    To avoid audio issues (full vs empty room), the test should be hearable at 75% volume (so room to go up if need be)

- Request [TiaaS infrastructure](https://galaxyproject.eu/tiaas) if using usegalaxy.eu
- Remind instructors to arrange microphone/headphones
- Create name badges, with space for people to specify pronouns, and send them to local hosts

    Name badges for attendees (and helpers) are important for participants as well. At busy venues, it can help attendees to find each other and remember each others' names. For the helpers, usually with a different color border so attendees can identify people who can help them with any issues they encounter.

- Prepare sign-in sheet for each location
- Contact participants to remind them of the workshop webpage where you have written location/directions, start/end times, and contact information
- Prepare the different slides:
    - Starting slides, including instructor presentation, different locations, etc
    - Wrap up slides for daily recap, including 5 minutes dedicated for filling the post-it feedback
    - Wrap up slides for the end of the workshop, including 5 minutes dedicated for filling the general feedback, remind of gitter/help/etc
- Create the collaborative document to collect questions from participants and document answers, e.g. by copying [our template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tN247JWpkpPl7FvEN9gsBcmVlZfRF_B0gnEWb5L3tMc)
- Create the collaborative document for the communication between the instructors and helpers, in order to get direct feeback from sites, e.g. by copying [our template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X8V_frzVd5N87zaZ7PDCvtSZozaj8XnrYj9K6Ux9i_0/edit?usp=sharing)
- Prepare the feedback form for participants, e.g. by copying our template
- Prepare the feedback form for hosts, helpers and instructors, e.g. by copying our template
