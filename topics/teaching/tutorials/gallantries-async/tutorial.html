                <p><strong>asynchronous training events</strong>, i.e. MOOC style courses pair pre-recorded and written lesson materials with online participants following along at their own pace and convenience.</p>

<p>With this model, we aim to bring training events to the trainees while <strong>eliminate</strong> environmental impact of instructor <em>and</em> participant travel.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-an-asynchronous-training-event">What is an asynchronous training event?</h1>

<p><em>To illustrate a typical Gallantries/Smörgåsbord event and the different roles (1 person can have several roles), we have decided to share a story with several fictional characters</em></p>

<p><strong>Taylor</strong> is a training coordinator of an international research consortium. They recently surveyed researchers in the consortium on their need in HTS data analysis. The results were overwhelming: over 60 scientists at the several locations would like to learn how to analyze their own RNA-seq data. To fulfill this demand, Taylor decided to organize a Smörgåsbord style event: a 3-days online workshop. Taylor is the <strong>global organizer</strong> of this event, in charge of finding the date, contact and coordinate with the teachers, advertise the event, find the instructors, etc. After the event, Taylor will aggregate all feedback from participants, helpers and hosts and share them.</p>

<p>Taylor recruited 2 <strong>helpers</strong> for each day, from amongst the participating incitations. One of the helpers, <strong>Casey</strong>,  has some previous experience with RNA-seq data analysis and Galaxy. Before the workshop, they went through the training material and tested it. They will help participants during the workshop when they are stuck or get different results than the instructors. They will also give direct feedback to the instructor about the pace, any possible local issues etc.</p>

<p>Taylor also recruited 4 <strong>instructors</strong>, <strong>Farah</strong> among them. Farah is a trained bioinformatician and experienced instructor, regularly giving training to scientists on HTS data analysis. She will give the introduction and the first steps of RNA-seq data analysis lessons. Farah is located in Germany and teaches from a room at her institute in front of her computer. <strong>2 weeks</strong> before an event she needs to record her lesson as she would normally teach it during a live training, and provide that video to Taylor. Taylor will generate captions (e.g. YouTube’s auto-captions) to Farah who must review and manually correct any captioning mistakes, before returning those to Taylor.</p>

<p><strong>Alex</strong> is a PhD student in molecular biology based in Greece. They would like to learn about RNA-seq data analysis to be able to analyze the data they generated. They heard about the workshop and wish to join online. As a <strong>participant</strong>, Alex will actively participate in the workshop by running their first RNA-seq data analysis given the instructor’s instructions, ask for help from helpers when stuck, will raise their questions on the participant chat, and will give feedback using sticky notes and the dedicated feedback form.</p>

<h1 id="cost-of-an-event">Cost of an event</h1>

<p>With the asynchronous training model, the cost of organizing and participating in the workshop are essentially eliminated: the instructors do not need to travel to the venue, participants can learn wherever is convenient for them, no rooms nor coffee must be organised.</p>

<h1 id="event-timeline">Event Timeline</h1>

<p>Here is an example event timeline we provided for a past Smörgåsbord event:</p>

<table>

    <tr>
      <th>Date</th>
      <th>Time Left</th>
      <th>What’s happening</th>

      <td>The final schedule is published</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>17 February</td>
      <td>4 weeks</td>
      <td>GTN CoFest! Here we will help you create workflows + workflow tests for your tutorials.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>14 March</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>It begins!</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We also provided instructors with an instructors guideline page <a href="https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/instructors">tailored to the event</a> and more important, a set of recording guidelines <a href="https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/events/smorgasbord2/recording.html">like the Gallantries’</a> which helped instructors know what was best practice during video recording.</p>

<h1 id="workshop-checklists">Workshop Checklists</h1>

<p>To help you organize an asynchronous event, we have created some checklists, by timing but also <a href="#checklists-by-role">by role</a>. Most of the items in these checklists are not specific to Gallantries/Smörgåsbord events.</p>

<h2 id="before-the-workshop">Before the workshop</h2>

<h3 id="global-organizers">Global organizers</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Identify the desired workshop contents and topics
    <ul>
      <li>Check the <a href="https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/">Video Library</a> to identify which videos are available</li>
      <li>Some may be out of date and need to be re-recorded</li>
      <li>Other videos may not exist for a given tutorial and will need to be recorded</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Identify and contact instructors who will record lessons</li>
  <li>Choose a date in coordination with instructors</li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a registration form, e.g. by copying <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mWl34vyXyhO-M9rwrrF0I-Kb2clSW0QHOiFTauweWv8">our template</a></p>

    <p>Such a registration form should include: participant details, email, affiliation, location for the workshop, accessibility requirements, motivation for participating, participation on social event, agreement on privacy statement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Setup a webpage to advertise the event</p>

    <p>This page should include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://galaxyproject.org/community/coc/">code of conduct</a></li>
      <li>general information about the event, its format (async)</li>
      <li>registration details and deadline</li>
      <li>draft schedule</li>
      <li>what participants need to do before</li>
      <li>details about the instructors, helpers, hosts</li>
      <li>sponsors (if any)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We created a <a href="https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/events/testevent/test-event.html">template of such a page</a> that can easily adapted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Identify places you can promote your event. <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub">Galaxy Hub</a> or <a href="https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss">Carpentries Discuss List</a> are the primary places to do this</p>

    <p>You should do this 1-3 month in advance of your event (if you can).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Collect contact details of the local hosts and instructors in case of last minute changes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arrange the schedule given the content, the instructor availability and the different time zones</p>

    <p>With asynchronous events, students may be working on the training at all times of day and night, so if possible, identify instructors in all of the major world regions (APAC, EMEA, AMER) who can work together to promptly answer student questions online.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Identify the chat platform (e.g. a private Slack, or the GTN Slack)</p>
  </li>
  <li>Arrange a conference call(s) with instructors and hosts in order to:
    <ul>
      <li>Meet in advance of the workshop</li>
      <li>Divide and document the responsibilities</li>
      <li>Share contact details</li>
      <li>Test the technical infrastructure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Request <a href="https://galaxyproject.eu/tiaas">TiaaS infrastructure</a> if using usegalaxy.eu</li>
  <li>Contact participants to remind them of the workshop webpage where you have written the joining instructions, start/end times, and contact information</li>
  <li>Prepare the feedback form for participants, e.g. by copying our template</li>
  <li>Prepare the feedback form for hosts, helpers and instructors, e.g. by copying our template</li>

<h2 id="global-organizers-3">Global organizers</h2>

<h3 id="before-the-workshop-1">Before the workshop</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Identify the desired workshop contents and topics
    <ul>
      <li>Check the <a href="https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/">Video Library</a> to identify which videos are available</li>
      <li>Some may be out of date and need to be re-recorded</li>
      <li>Other videos may not exist for a given tutorial and will need to be recorded</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Identify and contact instructors who will record lessons</li>
  <li>Choose a date in coordination with instructors</li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a registration form, e.g. by copying <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mWl34vyXyhO-M9rwrrF0I-Kb2clSW0QHOiFTauweWv8">our template</a></p>

    <p>Such a registration form should include: participant details, email, affiliation, location for the workshop, accessibility requirements, motivation for participating, participation on social event, agreement on privacy statement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Setup a webpage to advertise the event</p>

    <p>This page should include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://galaxyproject.org/community/coc/">code of conduct</a></li>
      <li>general information about the event, its format (async)</li>
      <li>registration details and deadline</li>
      <li>draft schedule</li>
      <li>what participants need to do before</li>
      <li>details about the instructors, helpers, hosts</li>
      <li>sponsors (if any)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We created a <a href="https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/events/testevent/test-event.html">template of such a page</a> that can easily adapted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Identify places you can promote your event. <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub">Galaxy Hub</a> or <a href="https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss">Carpentries Discuss List</a> are the primary places to do this</p>

    <p>You should do this 1-3 month in advance of your event (if you can).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Collect contact details of the local hosts and instructors in case of last minute changes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arrange the schedule given the content, the instructor availability and the different time zones</p>

    <p>With asynchronous events, students may be working on the training at all times of day and night, so if possible, identify instructors in all of the major world regions (APAC, EMEA, AMER) who can work together to promptly answer student questions online.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Identify the chat platform (e.g. a private Slack, or the GTN Slack)</p>
  </li>
  <li>Arrange a conference call(s) with instructors and hosts in order to:
    <ul>
      <li>Meet in advance of the workshop</li>
      <li>Divide and document the responsibilities</li>
      <li>Share contact details</li>
      <li>Test the technical infrastructure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Request <a href="https://galaxyproject.eu/tiaas">TiaaS infrastructure</a> if using usegalaxy.eu</li>
  <li>Contact participants to remind them of the workshop webpage where you have written the joining instructions, start/end times, and contact information</li>
  <li>Prepare the feedback form for participants, e.g. by copying our template</li>
  <li>Prepare the feedback form for hosts, helpers and instructors, e.g. by copying our template</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="during-the-workshop-1">During the workshop</h3>
