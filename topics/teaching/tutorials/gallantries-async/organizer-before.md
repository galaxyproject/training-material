- Identify the desired workshop contents and topics
  - Check the [Video Library](https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/) to identify which videos are available
  - Some may be out of date and need to be re-recorded
  - Other videos may not exist for a given tutorial and will need to be recorded
- Identify and contact instructors who will record lessons
- Choose a date in coordination with instructors
- Create a registration form, e.g. by copying [our template](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mWl34vyXyhO-M9rwrrF0I-Kb2clSW0QHOiFTauweWv8)

    Such a registration form should include: participant details, email, affiliation, location for the workshop, accessibility requirements, motivation for participating, participation on social event, agreement on privacy statement.

- Setup a webpage to advertise the event

    This page should include:
    - [code of conduct](https://galaxyproject.org/community/coc/)
    - general information about the event, its format (async)
    - registration details and deadline
    - draft schedule
    - what participants need to do before
    - details about the instructors, helpers, hosts
    - sponsors (if any)

    We created a [template of such a page](https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/events/testevent/test-event.html) that can easily adapted.

- Identify places you can promote your event. [Galaxy Hub](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub) or [Carpentries Discuss List](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss) are the primary places to do this

    You should do this 1-3 month in advance of your event (if you can).

- Collect contact details of the local hosts and instructors in case of last minute changes

- Arrange the schedule given the content, the instructor availability and the different time zones

  With asynchronous events, students may be working on the training at all times of day and night, so if possible, identify instructors in all of the major world regions (APAC, EMEA, AMER) who can work together to promptly answer student questions online.

- Identify the chat platform (e.g. a private Slack, or the GTN Slack)

- Arrange a conference call(s) with instructors and hosts in order to:
    - Meet in advance of the workshop
    - Divide and document the responsibilities
    - Share contact details
    - Test the technical infrastructure

- Request [TiaaS infrastructure](https://galaxyproject.eu/tiaas) if using usegalaxy.eu
- Contact participants to remind them of the workshop webpage where you have written the joining instructions, start/end times, and contact information
- Prepare the feedback form for participants, e.g. by copying our template
- Prepare the feedback form for hosts, helpers and instructors, e.g. by copying our template
