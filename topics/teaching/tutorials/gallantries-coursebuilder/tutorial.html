                <p>As part of the <a href="https://gallantries.github.io">Gallantries Project</a> we developed a small “Course Builder” which can help you build a schedule of pre-existing videos from the GTN Video library to use with your courses.</p>

    <p>Pick some modules from the left hand menu by clicking on them. They will turn blue when added to your event.</p>

  <li>
    <p>The “Session” Tab</p>

    <p>This tab allows you to organise your modules into sessions. Do you want to split up the materials by day? Or morning/afternoon? Or by week if you’re running a longer course?</p>
