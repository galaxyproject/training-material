???

- We have curated over 250 tutorials from as many contributors, over the past years of the GTN.
- These tutorials cover a wide range of scientific domains, from genomics, to machine learning, to climate sciences.

---

### Public, Peer-Reviewed, Community Maintained

.image-75[![Screenshot of github repo](/training-material/topics/contributing/images/github_screenshot.png)]

https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material

???

- The GTN is hosted on GitHub, and all changes need to be reviewed before they are accepted.
- This way, we have peer-reviewed tutorials that are checked by multiple reviewers before being accepted.
- Our fantastic volunteer community and topic moderators make this process possible.

???

- Tutorial mode is a recently added feature, wherein you can use the training materials from directly inside Galaxy.
- No more need to split your screen between a tutorial, and Galaxy.
- Additionally this adds the important feature of click-to-run tools.
- All tools used in the tutorials are hyperlinked to the Galaxy server you&apos;re using, just click a tool to activate it in Galaxy.

## Training Infrastructure as a Service (TIaaS)

.pull-left[
If you&apos;re using a Public Galaxy
- Sometimes the server is busy
- It&apos;s too popular, and someone else is running Big Jobs™
- I need my jobs to complete **fast**

If you&apos;re using a Private Galaxy
- What are my students doing?
- Are they keeping up?
- Or goofing off?
]

???
- If you have ever given a training using a Public galaxy server, maybe you have encountered the situation where the server is extremely busy, and your students jobs cannot run.
- In training you need these to complete quickly.
- Or if you&apos;re using a private server, you might want to keep an eye on your students.

--

.pull-right[
TIaaS Provides:

On public servers:
- Free resources for your events/classes/etc
- Private Queues on the big servers, *only* for your class/event.

Everywhere:
- A live dashboard showing how students are progressing
]

???
- TIaaS provides answers to both of these scenarios.
- On public Galaxies like Galaxy Europe or Australia, TIaaS provides a private queue to let your jobs run fast
- But everywhere, it gives you a dashboard to track student progress.

---

### The TIaaS Dashboard

![screenshot of tiaas dashboard showing a few jobs queued in grey, and a few completed successfully in green](/training-material/topics/teaching/images/tiaas-status.png)

???

- This dashboard was developed during a hybrid training event, pre-pandemic.
- Here we gave a training broadcast into three classrooms, and found we could not feel how fast or slow students were going.
- Were they completing jobs successfully? Or were they encountering issues?
- Thus the dashboard was born.
- It provides an anonymised list of students in the class, and shows which tools have been run recently.
- If a tool fails, you can know you may need to address this issue with the students.
- Or you can tell when you see 20 green jobs, that all of your students are done successfully!
- This allows you to be confident that you can move on with teaching.

---

### The Video Library

![video library homepage showing some descriptive text and big buttons leading to video library contents](/training-material/topics/contributing/images/video-library.png)

???

- The video library was a recent pandemic addition to the ecosystem.
- We gave several remote training events, namely the Smörgåsbord series.
- There we asked instructors to record themselves teaching a tutorial, and we uploaded these online for students to watch.

---

![video library stats graphic showing 101 hours and 175 videos](/training-material/topics/contributing/images/video-library-stats.png)

???
- These events were a great success, and a wealth of content was produced.
- Over 100 hours spread across 175 videos.
- All videos are fully captioned and checked by a human.

--

![video library all videos page listing several categories of tutorials with multiple videos covering Assembly, Climate, and Community](/training-material/topics/contributing/images/video-library-list.png)

???

- So we have collected all of the videos in a central location.
- You can re-use these freely in your lessons.
- We have heard that instructors love to include these in their lessons as preperatory videos for students to follow.
- Students can hear from experts, and come to class prepared for lessons.

## Keeps Training FAIR

GTN is a completely FAIR Training platform, meeting **all 10** criteria of the &quot;Ten simple rules for making training materials FAIR&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007854&quot;&gt;Garcia &lt;i&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt; 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)

[*Read more in the FAQ*](/training-material/faqs/gtn/fair_training.html)

- Rich machine-readable metadata, exposed for search engines
- [Tracked in TeSS&apos;s Training Repository](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/materials?content_provider=Galaxy+Training)
- Persistent URLs and DOIs
- Collaborative infrastructure

???

- Keeping training FAIR, or findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable is a hot buzzword these days.
- Endless papers and resources are produced on how to make your training fair, but implementing that is a lot of work.
- By using the GTN you are getting FAIR for free!
- Rich metadata about tutorials and resources are tracked within the GTN&apos;s framework, and exposed in machine readable ways that help us stay fair.
- All of our tutorials are additionally ingested and tracked by TeSS, the training e-support system of elixir.
- So get FAIR for free, and use the GTN.

## Keeps Training Accessible (Automatically!)

The GTN community cares about accessible training for students with disabilities.

**Visual**

- Screenreader friendly
	- Alternative slide deck views specifically for screen readers
- All images have (overall good) alt text

**Auditory**

- No sound used outside automated videos
- Those have transcripts + SRT captions available

**Cognitive**

- Animations respond to `prefers-reduced-motion`
- No auto-playing videos
- No sounds used

???

- The GTN community cares about accessibility, and works explicitly to ensure that all of our training resources are automatically accessible.
- This includes things like our framework generating more-accessible versions of existing training resources automatically.
- Or ensuring that we require alt text for every image.
- We cover a broad range of disabilities and accommodations that can be made, and are always open to hearing if there are ways we can improve what we are doing.
- If you or one of your students needs additional accommodations, please let us know, we will do our best.

## Frequently Asked Questions Library

.pull-left[
- Massive library of common questions
- Questions over Galaxy
- Questions over the GTN
- Reusable snippets that can be used in tutorials!
- [See them here!](/training-material/faqs/index.html)
]

.pull-right[
**Example FAQs**
- How do I upload via link?
- How to troubleshoot a failed job
- Why not use Excel?
- How to manage histories
- How to share a history
- Which Galaxy should I use?
]

???

- One of the things that is only possible at the scale of the GTN is a large FAQ library.
- With hundreds of training materials, and thousands of trained students, we&apos;ve identified many common questions and stored them as FAQs that can be reused in materials, or provided to students via URL.
- We use this large resource for all of our common questions for trainings, for answering student questions, and so on.

## Automatic Notebooks

.pull-left[
- Do you use Jupyter or RStudio notebooks?
- Do you use them as tutorials, where students can follow along?
- Check out the GTN&apos;s Automatic Notebook Generation

It&apos;s quite easy:

1. Write a GTN tutorial like normal
2. Enable the feature.
3. Select your programming language.
4. Automatic Notebooks are generated!
]

.pull-right[
![screenshot of a jupyter notebook showing the tutorial contents, including normal question and solution boxes.](/training-material/topics/contributing/images/jupyter-notebook-tutorial.png)
]

???

- If you&apos;ve ever written tutorials that cover programming topics like python or R, you might have wanted to use a notebook
- Producing a web version of that requires additional steps, and new tools to learn!
- So the GTN built a way to automatically generate notebooks from plain markdown, just like other GTN tutorials.
- If you write your lesson, you can easily convert it into a notebook compatible tutorial
- It will be visible online, for those who just want to read the text
- And it can be run in jupyter or rstudio via the automatic export of notebooks.
- Essentially no effort is required on your part.

## Choose Your Own Tutorial

.pull-left[
Do your students choose **Path A** (fresh data access)

![gtn tutorial showing a CYOA box with EGA-Archive selected, and a big heading about getting DAC access](/training-material/topics/contributing/images/cyoa-a.png)
]

.pull-right[
Or **Path B** (archived data copies)

![same tutorial but with the second option selected, accessing data stored on Zenodo and a hands on box instructing the student to download from URL](/training-material/topics/contributing/images/cyoa-b.png)
]

???

- A new feature of the GTN is choose your own tutorials.
- Here we have additional syntax you can use in your tutorial text, which lets you have multiple paths through your tutorial.
- We use this currently to have an alternative tool for a single step in a longer tutorial.
- The students can choose between either one assembler, or another.
- In the above graphic, students choose between a lengthy process to acquire data access, or using a public dataset now.

## Autogenerated Videos

Do you hate re-recording slide decks, once you&apos;ve updated a single number, on a single slide?

.pull-right[
- Try automated videos!
- By using the GTN&apos;s slide deck platform
- And adding speaker notes with exactly what you want to say
- We&apos;ll auto-generate a video
- Updating ALL visual + spoken portions
]

.pull-left[
![screenshot of the GTN&apos;s video player showing a slide about configuration management, with a transcript and recommended other video below](/training-material/topics/contributing/images/gtn-videos.png)
[**Demo**](https://training.galaxyproject.org/videos/watch.html?v=introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-short/slides)
]

???

- The GTN has a large library of great slide decks!
- Many of these already had good speaker notes to help other trainers teach a given topic.
- So we automatically generate videos from these slides.
- The speaker notes are read off from the slide and combined with the images, to produce a video.
- This is one such slide deck, which you may be listening to via an automated video currently! If not, check it out now.

## Feedback

.pull-left[
- We automatically collect feedback on trainings
- And aggregate it for tutorial authors to see
]
.pull-right[
![two charts show a growth in responses over time, and a heavily 5-star distributino of ratings of a particular tutorial. Below is a section of detailed feedback listing positive and negative aspects.](/training-material/topics/contributing/images/feedback.png)
]

???

- To support our amazing trainer community, we collect feedback on every tutorial.
- Students are encouraged to fill out a very short form which records any parts they loved, and what they thought needs improvement.
- We aggregate these reports for trainers to see, and use them to improve tutorials.

---

## Page View Metrics

For every training page, the view metrics are public to see how well training is doing

![plausible interface screenshot showing that we&apos;ve drilled down into an introduction tutorial that had 7.1k unique visitors over the last 12 months, with 12k total page views. Below is a top sources table, most come from google, and a top pages table which only shows our selected training page.](/training-material/topics/contributing/images/plausible.png)

???

- Additionally one of the most requested features was the ability to see how often a tutorial was viewed.
- We used to use google analytics and obtaining that data required a specific person to access it for us.
- We have replaced that with a public metrics dashboard, where anyone can see the GTN&apos;s page views over time.
- This particular tutorial was has 7.1 thousand unique views over the last 12 months, and we can see that many viewers came from google and a few university websites.

## Integrated Quizzes

- Love Kahoot in theory?
- But not in practice?
- The GTN has a built-in Kahoot-like quiz interface

![image of the gtn section on quizzes with a SQL basics recap quiz, offering self study and classroom modes.](/training-material/topics/contributing/images/quiz.png)

???

- Another feature built into the GTN from teacher frustration was kahoot quizzes.
- We wanted a similar interface, but not full of adverts or using proprietary infrastructure.
- Additionally we wanted something we could track and version control, allowing us to review changes to quizzes like we review changes to tutorials.
- So we built it.

---

![Image of the quiz with the question &quot;What keyword do you use to retrieve data in SQL&quot; and four options in pastel colours.](/training-material/topics/contributing/images/quiz-view.png)

???

- Here is what the interface looks like, students see an identical one and can click on the large colourful buttons.
- A teacher view is available that is kept in-sync with student views.
- After a question is completed you can review what percentage got it correct.
- Some of the explicitly competitive features like answering more quickly for more points are not present.

## Planemo Training Development Kit

- Tutorials require a lot of writing to setup
- Automates the boring parts!

Steps:

1. Build a workflow in Galaxy
2. Publish it
3. Use [ptdk.apps.galaxyproject.eu](http://ptdk.apps.galaxyproject.eu) to create a skeleton
4. All steps, tools, parameters are filled out for you!

???

- We found that writing tutorials was a lot of work, on a lot of routine tasks like describing how to execute Galaxy tools.
- So the Planemo Training Development Kit or PTDK for short was born.
- It converts a workflow in Galaxy, into a tutorial ready to be added to the GTN.
- All workflow steps are converted into text descriptions that students can use to follow the workflow
- It&apos;s just up to you to add in any formative assessments or explanations you need to help your students understand the background of the analysis.

---

## Running a workshop

Lots of resources for new teachers as well:

- Set up a Galaxy for Training ([tutorial](/training-material/topics/teaching/tutorials/setup-galaxy-for-training/tutorial.html))
- Good practices to run a workshop ([tutorials](/training-material/topics/teaching/index.html))

???

- For teachers getting into Galaxy training, we have a large library of resources available to you.
- We encourage you to check out the &quot;How to teach with Galaxy&quot; topic in the GTN.
