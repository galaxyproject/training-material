<h1 id="prepare-for-installation">Prepare for installation</h1>

<p>If you have a Galaxy server already running somewhere and would like to support one or more training modules, <a href="https://ephemeris.readthedocs.io">ephemeris</a> can be used to easily install all the required tools, reference data, data libraries, tours and workflows.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this training, we will create a Galaxy instance running on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localhost:8080</code>, but these instructions can be adapted for use with any Galaxy instance by replacing this value with the URL or IP address of your Galaxy server.</p>

<h2 id="start-a-local-galaxy">Start a local Galaxy</h2>

<p>To setup a Galaxy server locally, we will first clone the Galaxy github repository, make a few small edits to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">galaxy.yaml</code> configuration file, and then start the server.</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <div class="box-title hands-on-title" id="hands-on-setup-a-local-galaxy-instance"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Hands-on: Setup a local Galaxy instance</div>

  <ol>
    <li>Clone the github repository
      <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy.git
<span class="nb">cd </span>galaxy

    <li>Add yourself as admin user in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/galaxy.yaml</code>
      <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cp </span>config/galaxy.yml.sample config/galaxy.yml
</code></pre></div>      </div>
      <p>open the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">galaxy.yml</code> file with your favorite editor and edit the following line with your email address:</p>
      <div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">admin_users</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">user@example.org</span>

    <li>Start Galaxy
      <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sh run.sh
</code></pre></div>      </div>
      <p>Galaxy will now install all its requirements, which may take a few minutes,
when all is finished installing, you should see something like this in your screen:</p>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Starting server in PID 9560.

<h2 id="find-your-galaxy-api-key">Find your Galaxy API key</h2>

<p>In order to install the tutorial requirements, we will need the API key of an admin user.</p>

<h2 id="install-ephemeris">Install Ephemeris</h2>

<p>To install to training requirements to our Galaxy, we will use Ephemeris, let’s install it now:</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <div class="box-title hands-on-title" id="hands-on-install-ephemeris"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Hands-on: Install Ephemeris</div>

virtualenv .venv<span class="p">;</span> <span class="nb">.</span> .venv/bin/activate

</code></pre></div>  </div>

<h1 id="installing-tutorial-requirements">Installing tutorial requirements</h1>

<p>We have created a small bash script to automatically install all of a tutorial’s requirements to an existing Galaxy. It’s located in this repository under: <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/tree/main/bin/install_tutorial_requirements.sh"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/install_tutorial_requirements.sh</code></a></p>

<p>In this example we will install the requirements for the <a href="/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/ref-based/tutorial.html"><em>Reference-based RNASeq</em></a> tutorial to the Galaxy instance running on localhost.</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <div class="box-title hands-on-title" id="hands-on-install-a-tutorial"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Hands-on: Install a tutorial</div>

  <ol>
    <li>If you have not done so yet, clone the training material github repo:
      <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material.git
<span class="nb">cd </span>training-material
</code></pre></div>      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Run the script to install the RNASeq tutorial</p>

      <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bin/install_tutorial_requirements.sh topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/ref-based http://localhost:8080 &lt;api key&gt;
</code></pre></div>      </div>
    </li>
  </ol>

</blockquote>

<p>Installation may take some time. This script will automatically install the tools, create a data library and populate it with the input datasets from Zenodo, install and publish the workflows, and run any data managers that might be required.</p>

<p>The only thing the script cannot currently automate is the installation of the interactive tours. We will now do this manually by copying the contents of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tours</code> folder to our Galaxy instance, in the folder <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$GALAXY_ROOT/config/plugins/tours</code></p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <div class="box-title hands-on-title" id="hands-on-install-the-interactive-tours"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true" ></i> Hands-on: Install the interactive Tours</div>

  <ol>
    <li>Copy the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tour.yaml</code> file from the training materials repo to Galaxy
      <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cp</span> <span class="nt">-r</span> topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/ref-based/tours/ <span class="nv">$GALAXY_ROOT</span>/config/plugins/tours
</code></pre></div>      </div>
    </li>
  </ol>

<h2 id="installing-an-entire-topic">Installing an entire topic</h2>

<p>If you would like to install all the requirements for every tutorial within an entire topic, you can use the script in <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/tree/main/bin/install_topic_requirements.sh"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/install_topic_requirements.sh</code></a></p>

<h2 id="installing-a-subset-of-components">Installing a subset of components</h2>

<p>If you would like to pick and choose what to install for each tutorial, below are descriptions of the commands used to install each of the components (tools, workflows, reference data, data libraries, tours) please see the <a href="#quickstart">Quickstart section</a> for the individual commands used by the script</p>

<h1 id="quickstart">Quickstart</h1>

<p>Below is the list of commands used in this tutorial.</p>

<p>Using the scripts in this repository:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Make sure you are in the root of the training-material repo</span>
<span class="nb">cd</span> &lt;training-materials repo root&gt;

<span class="c"># install single tutorial</span>
bin/install_tutorial_requirements.sh topics/&lt;yourtopic&gt;/tutorials/&lt;yourtutorial&gt; &lt;Galaxy URL&gt; &lt;API key&gt;

<span class="c"># install entire topic</span>
bin/install_topic_requirements.sh topics/&lt;yourtopic&gt; &lt;Galaxy URL&gt; &lt;API key&gt;

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using ephemeris directly:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># install tools
shed-tools install -g &lt;Galaxy URL&gt; -a &lt;API key&gt; -t &lt;(curl https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/topics/&lt;topic&gt;/tutorials/&lt;tutorial&gt;/tutorial.json | jq .admin_install_yaml -r)

# create data library with input datasets
setup-data-libraries -g &lt;Galaxy URL&gt; -a &lt;API key&gt; -i topics/&lt;topic&gt;/tutorials/&lt;tutorial&gt;/data-library.yaml

# install reference data
run-data-managers -g &lt;Galaxy URL&gt; -a &lt;API key&gt; --config topics/&lt;topic&gt;/tutorials/&lt;tutorial&gt;/data-manager.yaml

# install workflows
workflow-install --publish-workflows -g &lt;Galaxy URL&gt; -a &lt;API key&gt; -w topics/&lt;topic&gt;/tutorials/&lt;tutorial&gt;/workflows

# install tours
copy the contents of the "tours" directory for the tutorial to Galaxy's "config/plugins/tours/"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When data libraries are created, depending on the server settings, they may be created privately. You will need to fix their permissions either through the UI or the API if you have many datasets. UseGalaxy.eu uses <a href="https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/shared-data/blob/fb9b4ed069dcd59a39b40e9c7ea08a068d8a9df2/run.sh">a script</a> to correct the permissions.</p>
