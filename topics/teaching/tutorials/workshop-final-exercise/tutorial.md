# Running a demo training

After going through all the lessons around teaching, you have already learned the following components:

1. How learning works
2. How to design effective trainings, based on well-defined Learning Outcomes (LOs) and concept maps
3. How to assess the effectiveness of the learning process
4. How to provide and receive constructive feedback

In this final exercise, you will be putting all those skills together, produce a mini-tutorial (5'), deliver it and receive feedback.

> <hands-on-title> Prepare your training  - *{% icon time %} 15 min*</hands-on-title>
>
> Prepare your 5 minutes training based on the concept map created during the [design session]({% link topics/contributing/tutorials/design/tutorial.md %}) (~10-15 seconds introduction, 2.5 min training, 2 min assessment, and ~30 seconds closing)

> <hands-on-title>Training delivery and feedback  - *{% icon time %} 30 min - Groups of 4*</hands-on-title>
>
> Each person does the 5 minutes delivery of the material they prepared in the previous session, and then everyone (including the person doing the delivery) provides feedback using the following structure:
> - One thing I liked
> - One thing that could be improved
> 
> Keep in mind, the feedback needs to be positive and be specific
