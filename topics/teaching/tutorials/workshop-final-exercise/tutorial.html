<p>After going through all the lessons around teaching, you have already learned the following components:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How learning works</li>
  <li>How to design effective trainings, based on well-defined Learning Outcomes (LOs) and concept maps</li>
  <li>How to assess the effectiveness of the learning process</li>
  <li>How to provide and receive constructive feedback</li>
</ol>

<p>In this final exercise, you will be putting all those skills together, produce a mini-tutorial (5’), deliver it and receive feedback.</p>

  <p>Prepare your 5 minutes training based on the concept map created during the <a href="/training-material/topics/contributing/tutorials/design/tutorial.html">design session</a> (~10-15 seconds introduction, 2.5 min training, 2 min assessment, and ~30 seconds closing)</p>

  <p>Each person does the 5 minutes delivery of the material they prepared in the previous session, and then everyone (including the person doing the delivery) provides feedback using the following structure:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>One thing I liked</li>
    <li>One thing that could be improved</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Keep in mind, the feedback needs to be positive and be specific</p>
