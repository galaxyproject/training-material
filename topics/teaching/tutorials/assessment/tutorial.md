# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

* **Assessment**: evaluation or estimation of the nature, quality, or ability of someone or something
* **Feedback**: integrate the output of the assessment in the learning process

Teaching goal for this session is to develop an understanding of **different types of feedback**,when to give and receive feedback, and for which **purpose**.

By the end of this session, you will be able to:
* **Describe** the differences between formative and summative assessment
* **Tell** why frequent feedback is important
* **List** and **describe** a few techniques for formative feedback


The flowchart below highlights where the assessment and feedback phase falls in the overall Nicholls process. Additional information can be found in {% cite via2020course %} and {% cite nicholls2002developing %}.

![A flow chart of the five phases of the instructional design. The 1st phase is to select the Learning Outcomes, followed by the selection of the corresponding Learning Experiences. The third phase is to select the content that is relevant to the LO. The fourth phase is the development of the necessary assessments for the learners, with the final phase being the evaluation of the effectiveness of the LE and the LO, at which point the flow connects back to the first phase for the refinement of the process.](images/NichollsPhases.png "5 phases of instructional design described by Nicholls et al in Developing teaching and learning in higher education.

# Assessments

There are different types of assessment and different ways that we can categorise them.

1. **Pre-course assessment** (before the course) - verify the target audience of the course
2. **Preventive assessment** (beginning of the course) - final adjustments of the course to the reality of the participants
3. **Formative assessment** (during the course) - pilot in real time if learning is taking place
4. **Summative assessment** (right after the course) - measure and evaluate the knowledge and skills acquired
5. **Strategic evaluation** (after the course, long time after the course) - measure the adequacy, quality and impact of the course

## Formative vs summative assessment

![A cartoon figure showing the main difference between formative and summative assessment, when making soup. When the chef tastes the soup while preparing, it's formative assessment. When the guests taste the soup after its done, it's summative asssessment.](images/FormativeSummativeAssessment.png "Formative and summative assessment")

Formative assessment takes place **during** teaching and learning. Its purpose is to help both instructors and learners to become aware of what the focus should be. Its purpose is to **improve the quality of student learning**, _not_ to provide evidence for evaluating or grading students.


### Summative assessment

1. Aligned to LOs
    * to levels of complexity
    * to what you taught
    * to the level you taught it
2. Objective
3. Feasible


### Formative assessment

Formative assessment / feedback can be used to collect information about learners':

* prior knowledge
    * which knowledge gaps need to be filled before moving on
* mental models
    * whether their mental models are correct
* goals and objectives
    * if learners goals and objectives are aligned to the course's goals and outcomes
* frequent mistakes
    * which types of mistakes need special attention

> - For each, write an example.
{: .hands_on}

It should be highlighted that the best practice for teaching is to constantly monitor what is happening to students 
as they set about learning and investigate when things do not proceed as planned or expected.

## Collecting data from learners through formative assessment

Formative assessment can allow for:
- Asking questions to learners and getting responses orally
- Asking them to describe the strategy they would adopt to solve a problem
- Asking them to solve a problem in groups, or individually but in front of the class
- Using brainstorming and discussions
- Providing diagnostic questionnaires


In this course, we used the following types of assessments and the corresponding tools:
* Types
    * Questionnaires

        **Anonymous questionnaires** allow to have an idea of the level of knowledge of the whole group of learners.**Non-anonymous** and personal questionnaires allow to find out if the learner has a necessary pre-required knowledge. in the negative case indicate an appropriate teaching choice to palliate this lack.

    * Instant feedbacks or minute cards
    * Multiple Choice Question (MCQ)
* Tools
    * Shared notes
        * Silent time for free writing, answering
        * +1 to answers
        * Open questions
    * Google form as post-its
    * [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/)
    * [Socrative](https://www.socrative.com/)

There are many possible ways for the formative assessments:
* Instant feedback
    * Hand / Fist of five
    * Minute cards
        * Idea
            * Green: _Name one positive thing about the workshop so far_
            * Red: _Name one thing about the workshop that could be improved_
        * How to do it?
            * Sticky note
            * Google form
            * Anonymous answer to shared notes

* Asking questions & discussions
    * Asking questions to learners and getting responses orally;
* Brainstorming & concept maps
    * From wikipedia: Brainstorming is a [group creativity technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity_technique) by which efforts are made to find a conclusion for a specific problem by gathering a list of ideas spontaneously contributed by its members.
    * In other words, brainstorming is a situation where a group of people meet to generate new ideas and solutions around a specific domain of interest by removing inhibitions. People are able to think more freely and they suggest as many spontaneous new ideas as possible. All the ideas are noted down without criticism and after the brainstorming session the ideas are evaluated.
    * Brainstorming should address a specific question; sessions addressing multiple questions are inefficient.
    * The brainstorming technique can be used to build a concept map as a group.
* Self-evaluation & peer-evaluation


## How frequent should be formative feedback


> ### {% icon hands_on %} Self-reflect  (5 min)
>
> - Think about this session: how many feedback opportunities have you had so far?
>
> > {% icon tip %} Get feedback often
> > In this tutorial so far, there were at least 3 feedback opportunities
> > {: .tip}
{: .hands_on}


![A figure with a line plot, showing that the learners' attention peaks at ~7-10' and then drastically drops after 15+ minutes.](images/AttentionCurve.jpg "Attention Curve")

Formative assessment should be frequent:
* Ideally every 5 min
* At least every 10-15 min
* Attention span: 10-15 min
* Refocus attention


# Dealing with feedback

Feedback is hard.

![A cartoon showing that a single negative feedback among a lot of positive can still be the only one that one remembers eventually.](images/gettingFeedback.jpg "Getting feedback")

* Humans focus more on negative feedback than on positive (you are not alone)
* Breath deeply
* Try to see the point in the criticism, learn from it
* Don’t take it personally

Trainees feedback should be considered along other forms of quality evidence:
* Review what they have effectively learned (in exams)
* Consider your own experience of teaching
* Discuss with colleagues and friends
* Look at the feedback from past sessions of the same course
* Look at the response rates
* Look at the counter examples (contradictions)
* Look at the repetitive patterns (not at only one single answer)

## Learn and teach others how to give good feedback

![A humorous cartoon showing a parent teaching a child on how to provide constructive feedback when playing with other children.](images/givingGoodFeedback.jpg "Learn and teach others to give good feedback")

* One positive / One negative
* One up / one down
