.footnote[[back to start](#start)]

???
Discuss any practicalities now, for example
- Show or discuss the programme
- Will there be coffee breaks? Where?
- Will there be lunch? Where?
- Will there be a social event afterwards? Where?
- Do participants need to sign an attendance form?
- Where are the bathrooms, emergency exits?

- For example:
  - Who are you?
  - Where are you from?
  - What do you do?
  - Why did you join this workshop?

# Sticky Notes

.left-column70[
1. Status indicators
 - &lt;span style=&quot;color:lightgreen&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-sticky-note&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;sticky-note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Green: Used to indicate your progress
 - &lt;span style=&quot;color:pink&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-sticky-note&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;sticky-note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Pink: Put on your screen if you need help

2. End-of-day feedback
 - &lt;span style=&quot;color:lightgreen&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-sticky-note&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;sticky-note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Green: what did you like?

]

.footnote[*your sticky notes may be different colours | [back to start](#start)]

???
Get two different coloured sticky notes, and give one of each
to each of the participants

**Pink/red/orange:** Have learners put this on their screen if they
get stuck and would like a helper to come over. This will save
them having to keep their hand raised if all helpers are busy.

**Green/Yellow:** You might give an assignment (&quot;do this section on your own&quot;,
&quot;try to answer this question box with your neighbour&quot;) and want to continue centrally
afterwards. By asking participants to put up the sticky when they are done,
you will have a sense of when most of your learners are ready to continue.

**Request to instructors:**
 - Collect all sticky notes and add them to [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/discussions/1452)
   after the workshop to share the feedback and ideas for improvements with the GTN community.
 - Add any feedback received from yourself, other instructors, and helpers here as well

# Get to know our audience

- What is your background knowledge and experience?
- Next will be a series of yes / no questions
- Answer by holding up a sticky note
- There are no wrong answers!

.footnote[[back to start](#start) | [to blank question](#blankquestion)]

???
- If not using sticky notes, you can ask learners to raise their hand
  if their answer is yes (or thumbs up/down for yes/no)
- The following slides are a series of questions you might like to ask
- Not all of these may be relevant for your workshop, but you can ask your
  own tailored questions using [this blank question slide](#blankquestion).

???
Follow up with people answering &quot;yes&quot;
 - Was this another workshop? Or on your own?
 - What kind of analysis did you do?
 - How was your experience with it? How long ago?

You can follow this up with other file formats participants will encounter today
 - BAM/SAM
 - VCF
 - ..

This will give you an idea of how much time you should spend explaining the file formats
during the workshop

Possible follow-up: which genome browser? IGV? UCSC? JBrowse?

If the majority of your audience have never used a genome browser before,
you may want to spend some extra time explaining the concept and interface.

Examples:
 - I know what paired-end sequencing is
 - I have programmed in R before
 - I have performed a differential gene expression analysis before
 - I have an Illumina sequencer in my lab
