# Sticky Notes

.left-column70[
1. Status indicators
 - <span style="color:lightgreen">{% icon sticky-note %}</span> Green: Used to indicate your progress
 - <span style="color:pink">{% icon sticky-note %}</span> Pink: Put on your screen if you need help

2. End-of-day feedback
 - <span style="color:lightgreen">{% icon sticky-note %}</span> Green: what did you like?
 - <span style="color:pink">{% icon sticky-note %}</span> Pink: what could we improve tomorrow / next time?
 - Leave them on the whiteboard at the end of the day

.image-75[![image of dozens and dozens of sticky notes across a door. They are covered in writing in various handwriting.](../../images/workshop-intro/stickynotes_feedback.png)]
]

.footnote[*your sticky notes may be different colours | [back to start](#start)]

???
Get two different coloured sticky notes, and give one of each
to each of the participants

**Pink/red/orange:** Have learners put this on their screen if they
get stuck and would like a helper to come over. This will save
them having to keep their hand raised if all helpers are busy.

**Green/Yellow:** You might give an assignment ("do this section on your own",
"try to answer this question box with your neighbour") and want to continue centrally
afterwards. By asking participants to put up the sticky when they are done,
you will have a sense of when most of your learners are ready to continue.

**Request to instructors:**
 - Collect all sticky notes and add them to [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/issues/989)
   after the workshop to share the feedback and ideas for improvements with the GTN community.
 - Add any feedback received from yourself, other instructors, and helpers here as well
 - Example feedback posts from other instructors: [here](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/issues/989#issuecomment-493438843) and [here](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/issues/989#issuecomment-493642457)

name:audience

# Get to know our audience

- What is your background knowledge and experience?
- Next will be a series of yes / no questions
- Answer by holding up a sticky note
- There are no wrong answers!

{% include topics/teaching/tutorials/workshop-intro/yesno.md %}

.footnote[[back to start](#start) | [to blank question](#blankquestion)]

???
- If not using sticky notes, you can ask learners to raise their hand
  if their answer is yes (or thumbs up/down for yes/no)
- The following slides are a series of questions you might like to ask
- Not all of these may be relevant for your workshop, but you can ask your
  own tailored questions using [this blank question slide](#blankquestion).

.footnote[[back to start](#start) | [to blank question](#blankquestion)]

???
Follow up with people answering "yes"
 - Was this another workshop? Or on your own?
 - What kind of analysis did you do?
 - How was your experience with it? How long ago?

# I have run bioinformatics tools or analyses before

{% include topics/teaching/tutorials/workshop-intro/yesno.md %}

.footnote[[back to start](#start) | [to blank question](#blankquestion)]

???
Possibly follow up with people answering "yes"
- Which tools? Commandline? Galaxy? Both? Other?

This will give you an idea of how much time you should spend explaining the file formats
during the workshop

# I have used a genome browser before

{% include topics/teaching/tutorials/workshop-intro/yesno.md %}


.footnote[[back to start](#start) | [to blank question](#blankquestion)]

???
Possible follow-up: which genome browser? IGV? UCSC? JBrowse?

If the majority of your audience have never used a genome browser before,
you may want to spend some extra time explaining the concept and interface.
