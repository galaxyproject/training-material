# Introduction

One of the first questions we must clarify before starting the journey through the history of Science is: **what is the origin of the term Science?** It stems from the Latin *scientia*, which can be translated as “knowledge”. In turn, the Latin term derives from the Greek *skizein*, which means to “separate or divide”. The German equivalent, *Wissenschaft*, has a broader application compared with the English term, since it also includes humanities (such as philosophical investigations), and refers to knowledge in general. Its root (*Wissen*) is probably related to *vid* (Sanskrit: विद्), which can be translated as knowledge, in the sense of “wisdom”  ({% cite Kluge2011 %}). Thus, synthesizing both conceptions, we could consider that Science requires dividing an object of analysis, and understanding its parts and connections, in order to generate knowledge. 

From those definitions, the following questions arise: which rules do we have to follow to divide the Reality into its elements? How should we apply those rules? Have these rules been constant throughout history? We consider these questions essential because, while for most scientists, Science consists of a persistent attempt to model Nature in terms of an established theoretical framework, they are often unaware of the role of theoretical frameworks and socio-economic contexts in determining the priority of the problems to be solved, and conditions the canons of explanation that will be considered valid ({% cite Brown1979 %}, {% cite Varela1972 %}, {% cite Kuhn1979 %}).  

To conclude this short introduction, it is necessary to warn you that this text is not devoid of ideology since, as Ernesto Sábato pointed out, “those who think that men of Science research without aesthetic-metaphysical bias have a rather singular idea of what scientific research is” ({% cite Sabato2022 %}).

# Science in Ancient Greece

According to the historian Benjamin Farrington, Homer's Iliad was the forerunner of the scientific conception of the world. Achilles would symbolize a new cosmovision in which human aspires to put an end to the tyranny of gods, whom he has feared since the dawn of time. For Farrington, Homer, in his claim to place Man at the center of the Universe, laid the foundations of Humanism, and with Humanism was born Science as a logical effect of the efforts to master her/his present ({% cite Farrington2018 %}).

It was with the Ionian school, founded in the 6th century BC, that one of the most original aspects of Greek science, speculative philosophy, was born. For its members, among whom were such outstanding figures as Thales of Miletus, Heraclitus of Ephesus and Anaximadrus, through the collaboration between the senses and the intellect would be  possible to access the order behind the apparent disorder of Nature, allowing to explain all natural phenomena without resorting to mythological relates (% cite Schifter1996 %}, {% cite Farrington2018 %}, {% cite Farrington1967 %}).  One of the first bites in History at the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge.
