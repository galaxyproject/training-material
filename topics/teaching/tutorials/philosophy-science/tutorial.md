# Introduction

One of the first questions we must clarify before starting the journey through the history of Science is: **what is the origin of the term Science?** It stems from the Latin *scientia*, which can be translated as “knowledge”. In turn, the Latin term derives from the Greek *skizein*, which means to “separate or divide”. The German equivalent, *Wissenschaft*, has a broader application compared with the English term, since it also includes humanities (such as philosophical investigations), and refers to knowledge in general. Its root (*Wissen*) is probably related to *vid* (Sanskrit: विद्), which can be translated as knowledge, in the sense of “wisdom”  ({% cite Kluge2011 %}). Thus, synthesizing both conceptions, we could consider that Science requires dividing an object of analysis, and understanding its parts and connections, in order to generate knowledge. 

From those definitions, the following questions arise: which rules do we have to follow to divide the Reality into its elements? How should we apply those rules? Have these rules been constant throughout history? We consider these questions essential because, while for most scientists, Science consists of a persistent attempt to model Nature in terms of an established theoretical framework, they are often unaware of the role of theoretical frameworks and socio-economic contexts in determining the priority of the problems to be solved, and conditions the canons of explanation that will be considered valid ({% cite Brown1979 %}, {% cite Varela1972 %}, {% cite Kuhn1979 %}).  

To conclude this short introduction, it is necessary to warn you that this text is not devoid of ideology since, as Ernesto Sábato pointed out, “those who think that men of Science research without aesthetic-metaphysical bias have a rather singular idea of what scientific research is” ({% cite Sabato2022 %}).

# Science in Ancient Greece

According to the historian Benjamin Farrington, Homer's Iliad was the forerunner of the scientific conception of the world. Achilles symbolized a new cosmovision in which human aspires to put an end to the tyranny of gods, whom he has feared since the dawn of time. For Farrington, Homer, in his claim to place Man at the center of the Universe, laid the foundations of Humanism, and with Humanism was born Science as a logical effect of the efforts to master her/his present ({% cite Farrington2018 %}).

It was with **the Ionian school**, founded in the 6th century BC, that one of the most important aspect of Greek science emerged: speculative philosophy, understood as an attempt to provide a systematic explanation of human existence and of the universe. For its members, among whom were such outstanding figures as Thales of Miletus, Heraclitus of Ephesus and Anaximadrus, through the collaboration between the senses and the intellect would be  possible to access the order behind the apparent disorder of Nature, allowing to explain all natural phenomena without resorting to mythological relates ({% cite Schifter1996 %}, {% cite Farrington2018 %}, {% cite Farrington1967 %}). 

Despite the Ionian speculation is considered the precursor of modern Science, it was with the rise of **the Hippocratic school** around 430 B.C. that Science in its strictest sense was initiated. According to Hippocrates, medicine should rely on detailed observation, reason and experience to establish diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. To them we owe the idea so common today, in spite of its scarce practical realization, that **science should benefit the human species**. 

Another of the characteristic elements of Greek science, which largely determined its development, derives from the consideration that physical speculation had to circumscribe itself to the peremptory world of phenomena, which **Parmenides**, considered the father of Metaphysics, had denounced as a mere illusion of the senses ({% cite Farrington1967 %}). It is somewhat contradictory that, despite his rejection of perception as a means of accessing scientific knowledge, it is to Parmenides that Science owes the belief in eternal laws and the axiomatic mode of exposition, now seen as the universally valid foundation of knowledge ({% cite Feyerabend2016 %}).

Another intellectual tradition that had a great influence on Greek scientic thought was Pythagoreanism, originated in the 6th century BC, to which we owe the belief that behind the apparent disorders of nature there is always a hidden order. According to **the Pythagorean school**, which had an enormous influence on Plato, mathematics, whose object was spatial and numerical relations, was the science of the eternal and immutable, independent of the fallacious proof of the senses, and apprehended only by reason or the soul ({% cite Farrington1967 %}).

The emergence of **Platonism** in the 3th century BC, characterized by its contempt for the physical world, is considered by many authors to be the beginning of the decline of scientific thought in ancient Greece. For Plato, mathematics, ethics and theology were inseparably united as a priori sciences, independent of experience, sources of the only attainable truth and sharply opposed to physical science, condemned as materialistic ({% cite Farrington1967 %}).
