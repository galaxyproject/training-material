            The mode of the event. For some reason the schema.org markup for this provides three separate axes (online/onsite/blended, synchronous/asynchronous, and full-time/part-time), but we're just going to use the first axis because there is no way to represent choices from each axis. Why, schema.org why‽ If you want to record async/sync please do so in the separate attribute, and we will not record full/part time.
