            The type of topic, some have subtly different behaviours.

            `admin-dev`
            :  should be used for admin and developer topics that are not scientifically focused.

            `basics`
            :  Only used for galaxy-interface type topics

            `data-science`
            :  Topics which are not necessarily Galaxy focused but expand into broader communities

            `use`
            :  These topics use galaxy for some analysis

            :  Specific to topics related to instruction of Galaxy
