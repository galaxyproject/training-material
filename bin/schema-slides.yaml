            list of learning objectives for the tutorial

            A learning objective is a single sentence describing what a learner will be able to do once they have done the tutorial. Generally it is best to follow a 2C or 3C learning objective such as:

            - Compute (Skill)
            - multiple whole genome assemblies (Objective)
            - in such a way to develop big data processing skills (Result)
        examples:
            - Understand the basic concepts behind phylogenetic trees, as applied to *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*
            - Explore Biodiversity data with taxonomic, temporal and geographical informations
            - Generate a DotPlot emulating the original paper using a different analysis tool

            List of take-home messages. This information will appear at the end
            of the slides. These should really be a key point, something that
            should stick in their mind; what you want them to take home from
            the slides.
        examples:
            - Pangeo is an inclusive community promoting open, reproducible and scalable science.
            - Balanced batches and replicates allow bioinformatic batch correction
            - Galaxy workflows can download images from the IDR, selecting specific channels, time points, z-stack positions and crop the image in different ways.
