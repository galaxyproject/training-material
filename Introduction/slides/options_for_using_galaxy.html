# Options for using Galaxy

---

### Options for using Galaxy

- Galaxy is available in many ways, each with different configurations and capabilities

- Here are some options

???

Many workshops use Galaxy instances that go away once the workshop is done.
This deck lists options for using Galaaxy outside of a training context.

---

### usegalaxy.org

- [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org/) is the Galaxy Project's public server
- Hosted at the [Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/)
- Lots of
  - tools
  - reference genomes
  - compute power
  - storage

- But also very busy
  - Averages 250,000 jobs *per month* in 2016
  - A single resource cannot scale to meet the demand of the entire world, nor can it support all wanted tools, genomes, ...

### Public Galaxy Servers

1. General purpose genomics servers
1. Domain specific servers
   These can be specific to:
   - *Research methods*: ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, repeats, ...
   - *Organisms*: Pathogens, phage, rice, poplars (!), ...
   - *Non-genomic domains*: image analysis, social science, natural language processing, ...
1. Tool servers
   - Host specific tools, usually from one lab, to make the tools easy to access and run

### Semi-public Galaxy services

- Access based on geography or membership in a community

- [bit.ly/gxysemipublic ](http://bit.ly/gxysemipublic)

### Semi-public Galaxy services
| Geography  | Resource |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Australia  | [Genomics Virtual Lab (GVL)](https://launch.genome.edu.au/launch)  |
| Canada | [GenAP](https://www.genap.ca/) |
| Norway | [Norwegian e-Infrastructure for Life Sciences (NeLS)](https://nels.bioinfo.no/) |
| Poland | [PL-Grid](https://galaxy.plgrid.pl/) |
| US | [Jetstream](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Cloud/Jetstream) |

### On public clouds via CloudLaunch

[.image-25[![](../images/cloudlaunch_empty.png)]](https://launch.usegalaxy.org/)

- Currently supports Amazon Web Services

- [launch.usegalaxy.org](https://launch.usegalaxy.org/)
  - CloudLaunch currently only supports AWS (and Jetstream, but that's covered above).
    To use it with AWS you need to create an AWS account, which does require a
    credit card, and then provide your public and secret keys to CloudLaunch.

---

### CloudLaunch / CloudMan instances

[.image-25[![](../../shared/images/cloudman_based_server_landing_page.png)]](http://wiki.galaxyproject.org/CloudMan)

- Comes with 100's of tools and many pre-defined reference genomes.
  - CloudLaunch starts a CloudMan based Galaxy instance.
  - CloudMan is a cloud management tool that moves much / all of the cloud management work into a Graphical user interface.

---

### CloudMan

[.image-25[![](../../shared/images/cloudman_management_console_showing_autoscaled_w_1_worker.png)]](http://wiki.galaxyproject.org/CloudMan)

- CloudMan enables you to statically or dynamically scale compute power.
    - This example shows a Galaxy Server with a head node and one worker node, and that is configured to scale up to 5 worker nodes, if demand justifies it.
    - Before leaving this cloud section stress the importance of shutting down and removing everything when you are done.
    - Cloud instances can be incredibly cost effective, but only if you are actually using them when they are up.
    - Paying to have a cloud instance up for two weeks that you only use for 8 hours is not cost effective.

### Docker (and maybe other appliances?)

Stuff about docker...

---

### Run your own Galaxy locally

- Galaxy is [open source software](http://getgalaxy.org/) and can be installed on local compute infrastructure, from lab servers to insitutional compute clusters.
- Installing Galaxy locally is relatively easy, but
  - the initial install does not include reference genomes and only has a few tools
  - Installing tools and genomes, setting up authentication, and connecting to institutional compute resources all takes work.
- There are hundreds, if not thousands of local Galaxy installs around the world.
  - Installing tools and genomes has become much easier in recent years, and can now often be done with the Galaxy Admin GUI.
  - Authentication and connecting to institutional compute resources is still heavy lifting.

---

### Commercial support

- You can buy a [preconfigured Galaxy server](https://bioteam.net/products/galaxy-appliance/) from [BioTeam](https://bioteam.net)
- [Globus Genomics](https://www.globus.org/genomics) and [GenomeCloud](http://www.genome-cloud.com/) provide cloud-based Galaxy servers.
- (And [commercially provided consulting and training](https://galaxyproject.org/support/commercial/) are also available)

### Which Galaxy instance to use?

- Choose base on
  - size of datasets, available storage, backup
  - data security
  - computational requirements
  - tools installed
