# What is Galaxy?

---

### What is Galaxy?

- Web-based platform for computational biomedical research https://galaxyproject.org/
  - Developed at Penn State, Johns Hopkins and G. Washington universities with substantial outside contributions
  - Open source under [Academic Free License](https://opensource.org/licenses/AFL-3.0)
- &gt;4300 [citations](http://www.citeulike.org/group/16008/)
- &gt;80 [public Galaxy servers](https://new.galaxyproject.org/public-galaxy-servers/)
  - Many more non-public
  - Both general-purpose and domain-specific

???

The Galaxy Team is composed by bioinformaticians and software engineers

### Core values

- Accessibility
- Reproducibility
- Transparency

???

Accessibility: Users without programming experience can easily specify parameters and run tools and workflows.
Reproducibility: Galaxy captures information so that any user can repeat and understand a complete computational analysis.
Transparency: Users share and publish analyses via the web and create Pages, interactive, web-based documents that describe a complete analysis.

# User Interface

---

### Main UI

TODO: add image here

---

### Tools

- Each tool is just a text file describing:
  - inputs + parameters => commands => outputs
  - Help, tests, citations, requirements,...
- Every software can be embedded
- [Tool Shed](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/): free tool store
- New versions can be installed without removing old ones to ensure reproducibility

---

### Histories

- At the heart of Galaxyâ€™s reproducibility
- For each dataset, the history tracks:
  - Name, format, size, creation time, datatype-specific metadata
  - Tool id and version, inputs, parameters
  - Stdout, stderr
  - State (<span style="color: grey">grey</span>: waiting; <span style="color: yellow">yellow</span>: running; <span style="color: green">green</span>: success; <span style="color: red">red</span>: failed)
  - Hidden, deleted, purged
- Each history should correspond to a different analysis

???

Purged means permanently deleted

---

### Workflows

- Graphical editing
- Can be **extracted** from a history
- Re-run the same analysis on different inputs
- Parameters can be changed before running
- Workflow **scheduling**
  - A job is submitted as soon as its inputs are ready
- **Sub**-workflows: a workflow inside another workflow
