    - [Processing many samples at once](http://bgruening.github.io/training-material/Introduction/slides/processing_many_samples.html)
    - [Using the Integrative Genomics Viewer](http://bgruening.github.io/training-material/Introduction/slides/igv.html)

# Tutorials

Several tutorials with hands-on are available for this topic:

- [Galaxy Introduction Exercise: From Peaks to Genes](tutorial/introduction.md)
- [Getting to know workflows](tutorial/workflows.md)
- [Processing many samples at once](tutorial/processing_many_samples.md)
- [Using the Integrative Genomics Viewer](./tutorials/igv.md)

## Input datasets

The input datasets for the tutorials will be soon available on Zenodo

## Galaxy instance

For this tutorial, you can use the [dedicated Docker image](docker/README.md):

```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 bgruening/galaxy-introduction-training
```

It will launch a flavored Galaxy instance available on
[http://localhost:8080 ](http://localhost:8080).
