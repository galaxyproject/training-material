# What is Exome sequencing?

---

### Exome sequencing

= Whole exome sequencing (WES or WXS)

Sequencing of all expressed protein-coding genes in a genome
 
---

### Exome in Humans

- ~180,000 exons
- 1% of the human genome
- ~30 million base pairs

---

### Goal of exome sequencing

Identify genetic variation that is responsible for both Mendelian
and common diseases without the high costs associated with
whole-genome sequencing

Exome sequencing is the most efficient way to identify the
genetic variants in all of an individual's genes

---

### Limits

Exome sequencing can not identify genetic variation in

- All genes
- Mitochondrial genes
- “Structural variants”
- Triplet repeat disorders
- Other copy number variants
- Introns
- “Uniparental disomy”
- Control sequences
- Epigenetic changes
- Gene-gene (epistatic) interactions

## 2 tutorials for training on exome sequencing data analysis

---

### Same goal

Identify and annotate genetic variants in a family with two
parents and a child exome data
