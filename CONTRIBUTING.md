# How is the training material maintained?

## Maintainers

Each training topic and tutorial has one or two maintainers who act as editors.

They are responsible for making sure issues and change requests are looked at. They have the final say over what is included in the training material. But they are not responsible for writing/keeping up-to-date training material content or deciding what lessons ought to exist, both will be coming from the community.
