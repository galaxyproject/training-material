# How can I contribute?

You can report mistakes or errors, create more contents, etc. Whatever is your background, there is probably a way to do it: via the GitHub website, via command-line. If you feel it is too much, you can even write it with any text editor and contact us: we will work together to integrate it.

You can check our [Frequently Asked Questions](http://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/faq#how-can-i-contribute) and our [dedicated tutorials](http://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/contributing) for more details.

# How is the training material maintained?

## Maintainers

Each training topic and tutorial has one or two maintainers who act as editors.

They are responsible for making sure issues and change requests are looked at. They have the final say over what is included in the training material. But they are not responsible for writing/keeping up-to-date training material content or deciding what lessons ought to exist, both will be coming from the community.
