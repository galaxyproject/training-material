This is part of our ongoing effort to better annotate how people are contributing to the GTN and recognise all of the sources of contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding Agencies and Grants can be recognised in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CONTRIBUTORS.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file and include a funding statement describing their contributions or the specific award number. In the future, as people add more funding agencies this will become a more controlled field.&lt;/p&gt;

        This project (`2020-1-NL01-KA203-064717`) is funded with the support of the Erasmus+ programme of the European Union. Their funding has supported a large number of tutorials within the GTN across a wide array of topics.
