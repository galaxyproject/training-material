&lt;p&gt;The answers are automatically posted to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/issues/989&quot;&gt;GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt;. With &amp;gt; 1,300 answers, it is quite difficult to keep an eye on the answers, specially because the answers there are for all tutorials, but also to have an overview of the answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we have the feedback for a specific tutorial? Or for all the tutorials for a topic? How many feedback has been submitted? Are the tutorials appreciated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer some of these questions and help contributors, we created a &lt;a href=&quot;/training-material/feedback.html&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; which aggregate all feedback, display them globally, but also by topic and tutorials, including the free text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data from the feedback are automatically extracted every week to update the page and its graphs. The page is linked in the “Extras” menu on the top (with direct link to interesting section from topic and tutorial pages).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/training-material/feedback.html&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot;&gt;Visit the Feedback page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="news" /><category term="new feature" /><category term="contributors" /><summary type="html">As you have probably already seen, a feedback form is embedded on the bottom of each tutorial.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Accessibility Improvements</title><link href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2021/07/27/a11y.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Accessibility Improvements" /><published>2021-07-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-07-27T13:33:04+00:00</updated><id>https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2021/07/27/a11y</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2021/07/27/a11y.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility Improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our community members suggested on twitter that we support alternative formats for accessing our JavaScript based slides, as this can be difficult for users using screen readers. We’ve now added support for “plain text slides”, where we render the slide decks as a single long document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rendering is imperfect, due to how our slide deck library handles custom classes within slides, but it should still be an improvement for anyone who wants to scroll through the slides in an alternative format. You can find them linked from the first slide of each slide deck, or from the slides dropdown in the topic pages, &lt;em&gt;check them out!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally we’ve made a number of other minor accessibility improvements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed 533 missing alt texts for images&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Removed some repetitive icon names names when followed immediately by their descriptive text&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove repetitive image labels on author badges.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these were done after (&lt;a href=&quot;/training-material/hall-of-fame/hexylena/&quot; class=&quot;contributor-badge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/hexylena&quot; alt=&quot;Avatar&quot; /&gt;Helena Rasche&lt;/a&gt;) learned to use Android’s TalkBack and noticed the site could be unpleasant to go through. While absolutely not a replacement for someone who deeply understands the needs of visually impaired users or experiences such needs themselves, hopefully this makes the GTN a little bit more pleasant for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="news" /><category term="new feature" /><summary type="html">Accessibility Improvements</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">New Tutorial: Mutation calling, viral genome reconstruction and lineage/clade assignment from SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data</title><link href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2021/06/30/tutorial-sars-cov-2-variant-discovery.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New Tutorial: Mutation calling, viral genome reconstruction and lineage/clade assignment from SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data" /><published>2021-06-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-06-30T08:36:29+00:00</updated><id>https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2021/06/30/tutorial-sars-cov-2-variant-discovery</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2021/06/30/tutorial-sars-cov-2-variant-discovery.html">&lt;p&gt;Effectively monitoring global infectious disease crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, requires capacity to generate and analyze large volumes of sequencing data in near real time.

&lt;p&gt;The Galaxy community has developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/&quot;&gt;high-quality analysis workflows&lt;/a&gt; to support&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sensitive identification of SARS-CoV-2 allelic variants (AVs) starting with allele frequencies as low as 5% from deep sequencing reads&lt;/li&gt;

To support this, Apollo was deployed on UseGalaxy.eu. Over the past two years the GGA project has pushed forward apollo and tooling around it, and it finally culminates in this look at how to annotated your genomes in Apollo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But genome annotation isn’t just a solitary activity, from bacterial genomes to larger, they require an entire team of people to do the annotation process which is how Apollo further makes this process easy; by acting like a “Google Docs for Genome Annotation”, providing a collaborative, real-time genome annotation framework, entire teams can work together simultaneously with Apollo, analysing their data in Galaxy, and sending the results back to Apollo.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="news" /><category term="new tutorial" /><category term="genome-annotation" /><summary type="html">After two years, the Galaxy Genome Annotation team has finally finished their much awaited tutorial on doing Genome Annotation in Galaxy!

&lt;p&gt;As the GTN is intended to be easy for contributors and easy for learners, we wanted to make use of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;abbr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tag which allows you to define commonly re-used terms in your HTML. However this is a bit clumsy to write every time, so we’ve implemented a tag and some metadata which permits easily defining and referencing abbreviations throughout your text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your tutorial metadata you can add an abbreviations section like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;My awesome tutorial&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;abbreviations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Application Programming Interface&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;JavaScript Object Notation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in your text you can use braces to refer to the term&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;code-2col&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;code-in&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;code-in-input-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;far fa-keyboard&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;code-in&lt;/span&gt; Input: Markdown&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
The `/jobs` &amp;lbrace;API&amp;rbrace; will return &amp;lbrace;JSON&amp;rbrace;. When we call the &amp;lbrace;API&amp;rbrace; we'll get back this result &amp;lbrace;JSON&amp;rbrace;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;code-out&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;code-out-output&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-laptop-code&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;code-out&lt;/span&gt; Output&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/jobs&lt;/code&gt; Application Programming Interface (API) will return JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). When we call the &lt;abbr title=&quot;Application Programming Interface&quot;&gt;API&lt;/abbr&gt; we’ll get back this result &lt;abbr title=&quot;JavaScript Object Notation&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Galaxy siempre ha tenido tutoriales traducidos automáticamente mediante Google-Translate, ahora nos estamos embarcando en un nuevo proyecto para estudiar la experiencia de aprendizaje con tutoriales en bioinformática traducidos por humanos. Nuestro objetivo es crear un paquete de tutoriales para el análisis de datos single-cell (célula única) en primera instancia, con el fin de estudiar su uso y utilidad en un taller para hablantes nativos de español. Agradecemos enormemente a las nuevas participantes Patricia Carvajal López y Alejandra Escobar-Zepeda (EMBL-EBI) así como a las miembros existentes de GTN Beatriz Serrano-Solano (University of Freiburg), Saskia Hiltemann &amp;amp; Helena Rasche (Erasmus-MC), por su arduo trabajo en este proyecto de traducción y mantenimiento y, por supuesto, a Wendi Bacon (The Open University/EBI) como líder de proyecto.</summary></entry></feed>
