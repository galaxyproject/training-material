Where previously there were two subdomains each with their own sets of tools, there is now a unified subdomain with re-categorized tools that makes sense for users.</p>

<p>The central page was updated for the first time in years, and some excellent workflow and training search widgets were created. This went hand-in-hand with the creation of the <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/projects/singlecell/">Galaxy Single Cell Community of Practice page</a>.
This infrastructure connects - for the first time - single cell users from novices performing training in Galaxy, to searching more advanced workflows and tools beyond the training, and finally able to contribute, request tools, provide feedback or join the Community of Practice.</p>

<p>Let’s hear from Wendi about the experience.</p>

<h1 id="what-spawned-this-project">What spawned this project?</h1>

<blockquote class="quote">
  <p>Trying to navigate users through all the quirks of Galaxy when they tried to move outside of the tutorials was challenging, and having to explain why we had two sites that both focused on single cell analysis was also tricky. This subdomain makes it a lot easier to communicate the potential to users - they can immediately see how many different toolsuites are available without being overwhelmed. They don’t have to debate whether to learn R or Python, Seurat or Scanpy - they can just try both! Plus, data formats is the thing that stumps users more than anything. My group was constantly losing track of which tool could do what to convert data formats, and I am absolutely thrilled to have an entire section devoted to these random tools that are so vital to applying the analysis to public or private data.</p>

<h1 id="what-was-it-like-to-do-this-at-egd-2023-cofest">What was it like to do this at EGD 2023 CoFest?</h1>

<blockquote class="quote">
  <p>I had no idea how difficult it would be to make what seemed like quite superficial changes to make the tool panels more usable! José was an absolute star, navigating through all of this seamlessly. Pavan kept finding single cell tools under a ton of different metadata titles, so it was also exciting to see just how many different tools were out there and to get them all in the same place. There’s so much more to play with than I realised! Helena jumped in virtually to make these banging widgets to prevent the sites from becoming outdated, and give contributors more of a voice in the site - if anyone shares a workflow tagged #singlecell on any of the Big 3 public instances, it’s now on our single cell page. I’m so glad we had the CoFest though, because getting together all the different single cell sites, getting all the tools that we found in the right spot, it required the entire day and then some and a lot of collaboration. At one point I was literally highlighting tool IDs in a giant list. It just wouldn’t have been feasible virtually. I’m so excited for the next training session to just see how users navigate the new site.</p>

This gives you more control over both how the GTN looks, and works, for you.</p>

<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>

<p>This will allow users to set their theme with some more granularity! Previously
you could only choose between a few themes, now these have been split into
separate axes giving you more control over how the GTN renders for you.</p>

<h3 id="brightness">Brightness</h3>

<p>Previously you could switch manually between light and dark themes. Now the GTN
will default to an automatic one that switches the GTN to dark mode when your
system preferences requests it.
Alternatively you can override this and choose a light or dark theme as you prefer.</p>

<h3 id="light-theme">Light Theme</h3>

<p>We’ve added a new light theme with a more yellowed background to be less harsh
on the eyes. When the GTN is using the light mode (automatically or manually)
you can toggle between this and the plain white version.</p>

<h3 id="dark-theme">Dark Theme</h3>

<p>Likewise, now when the GTN is using the dark mode (automatically or manually)
you can choose whether it will use the “night” (dark grey) or “midnight” (pure black) themes.</p>

<h3 id="contrast">Contrast</h3>

<p>Have you ever tried to use some applications in high-light environments, such
as outdoors and found them hard to read? Many websites use unfortunately low
contrast. The GTN now has a slider that allows you to select low, normal
(automatic), or high contrast as is your preference. High contrast will make
all elements a bit more contrasting to ensure you can see them more easily in
those environments.</p>

<h3 id="themes-1">Themes!</h3>

<p>Previously if you wanted the Halloween theme it would only exist on a dark
background, but now you can try them out on any background! The same goes for
all other GTN themes, so please feel free to choose whatever colours suit you,
knowing you’ll be able to use the GTN day and night.</p>

<h2 id="data-privacy">Data Privacy</h2>

<p>The GTN collects very limited information on you as a person. Most of our
developers are located in the EU, and live under GDPR. We do not want your personal data at all.</p>

<p>However we do collect very limited statistics (page views), and error logs via
Sentry (whenever errors occur). If you wish to opt-out of this collection, you
are welcome to do so here.</p>

The GTN has you covered with the Pan-Galactic Tool Search that is now available.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: the authors were reminded of
<a href="https://galaxycat.france-bioinformatique.fr/">GalaxyCat</a> which does the same
thing as the GTN but better! Please go use that.</p>

<hr />

<p>We recently received a question online from our colleague <a href="https://github.com/scottcain">Dr. Scott Cain</a>
trying to find the <em>Manta</em> Structural Variant analysis tool amongst the Galaxies. While
his complaints about generic names are very apt (and Galaxy existed before the
phone!) we do still have very generic names in our tools.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is also quite difficult with these large, complex,
JavaScript based web applications. So, the GTN has added a Pan Galactic Tool
Search!</p>

<iframe src="https://genomic.social/@scottcain/110498601155255378/embed" width="100%" height="250">
Scott: Arg! Please don't use common words to name your software projects! First (and a long time ago) you have the fine folks @galaxyproject using that word, then you have the SV caller Manta, making it impossible to answer with a simple google whether manta is available at a public Galaxy hub.
</iframe>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it Works</h2>

<p>The GTN uses the list of <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/use/">Public Galaxy
Servers</a> available from the Hub to construct
the dropdowns you see on Tutorials indicating which servers support a given
tutorial.</p>

<p>Every time the GTN gets deployed (at minimum once a day), we collect a list of
tools that are available from each of those servers. This metadata is available
directly from the GTN (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/api/psl.json</code>).</p>

<p>When we render a tutorial, we check the list of tools used in that tutorial,
both those annotated by authors, as well as whichever ones are mentioned in the
associated workflows, and list the intersection of what’s available.</p>

<p>Since we had this metadata already available, it was trivial to generate a tool
search which simply searches through this file and lists the relevant servers.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>As the GTN is a static site, so is our search. It takes a second to load the
tool search interface (~7MB uncompressed), but after that you can search more
or less instantaneously through all 15k versions of the 6k known tools we see
across the Galaxy.</p>]]></content><author><name>Helena Rasche</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="new feature" /><category term="gtn" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did you ever want to run a tool, but not know where it might be available?

We have automatically activated the new Progress Pride theme on the home page (<a href="#" onclick="setTheme('progress')">Click to Activate</a>) if you hadn’t already selected a theme.</p>

<p>This month we want to highlight the contributions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_L._Hart">Alan L. Hart</a>, an American physician and radiologist who pioneered the use of X-Rays to screen for Tuberculosis. Dr. Hart was one of the first trans men to have a hysterectomy in the US.</p>

<h2 id="tuberculosis">Tuberculosis</h2>

<p>Tuberculosis, mostly caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"><em>Mycobacterium Tuberculosis</em></a>, is 13<sup>th</sup> leading cause of death. It was temporarily decreased to the 2<sup>nd</sup> leading cause of death by an infectious agent, due to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Sadly, it retains this position despite being preventable and curable (<span class="citation"><a href="#who_tuberculosis_2023">WHO 2023</a></span>).</p>

<p>Roughly 23% of the world’s population is infected with <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, it claims 1.5 million lives each year (<span class="citation"><a href="#cdc_tuberculosis_2020">CDC 2020</a></span>).</p>

<h2 id="alan-l-hart">Alan L. Hart</h2>

<blockquote class="quote">
  <p>Hart graduated from Albany College in 1912, and in 1917 obtained a doctor of medicine degree from the University of Oregon Medical Department in Portland (now Oregon Health &amp; Science University);
[…]
Hart devoted much of his career to research into and treatment of tuberculosis. In the early 20th century the disease was the biggest killer in America. … Hart was among the first physicians to document how it then spread, via the circulatory system, causing lesions on the kidneys, spine, and brain, eventually resulting in death
[…]
In the early twentieth century [X-Rays] were used to detect bone fractures and tumors, but Hart became interested in their potential for detecting tuberculosis. Since the disease often presented no symptoms in its early stages, x-ray screening was invaluable for early detection.</p>

  <p>In 1937 Hart was hired by the Idaho Tuberculosis Association and later became the state’s Tuberculosis Control Officer. He established up Idaho’s first fixed-location and mobile TB screening clinics and spearheaded the state’s war against tuberculosis. Between 1933 and 1945 Hart traveled extensively through rural Idaho, covering thousands of miles while lecturing, conducting mass TB screenings, training new staff, and treating the effects of the epidemic.</p>

  <p>An experienced and accessible writer, Hart wrote widely for medical journals and popular publications, describing TB for technical and general audiences and giving advice on its prevention, detection, and cure. At the time the word “tuberculosis” carried a social stigma akin to venereal disease, so Hart insisted his clinics be referred to as “chest clinics”, himself as a “chest doctor”, and his patients as “chest patients”. Discretion and compassion were important tools in treating the stigmatised disease.</p>

  <p>In 1943 Hart, now recognised as preeminent in the field of tubercular Roentgenology, compiled his extensive evidence on TB and other x-ray-detectable cases into a definitive compendium, <em>These Mysterious Rays: A Nontechnical Discussion of the Uses of X-rays and Radium, Chiefly in Medicine</em> (pub. Harper &amp; Brothers), still a standard text today. The book was translated into several languages, including Spanish.</p>

<h1 id="new-galaxy-training-genome-wide-alternative-splicing-analysis">New Galaxy training: Genome-wide alternative splicing analysis</h1>

<p>Isoform switching is a biological phenomenon that plays a crucial role in the regulation and diversity of gene expression. It refers to the process by which alternative splicing of pre-mRNA generates different mRNA isoforms that can produce distinct protein products under different conditions. Despite the fact that alternative splicing has been demonstrated to play a fundamental roles in a wide range of biological contexts, such as tissue-specific expression, disease development and evolutionary adaptation, isoform-based expression anaysis pipelines are still rare when compared with gene-level quantification studies.</p>

<p>This new Galaxy training explores the isoform switching concept and provides a step-by-step guide for analyzing this regulatory mechanism. It makes use of <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR.html">IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR</a>, a R package which integrates a multi-step analysis for isoform detection and functional prediction.</p>

<figure id="figure-1" style="max-width: 90%; margin:auto;"><img src="/training-material/news/images/isoform_usage_post.jpg" alt="Overview of computational pipeline for isoform detection and functional prediction." width="1071" height="779" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="/training-material/news/images/isoform_usage_post.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> Adapted from Vitting-Seerup et Sandelin, 2017.</figcaption></figure>

<p>A second important aspect of this pipeline is that it allows to evaluate alternative splicing at two different levels: gene-specific and genome-wide scale. This dual-approach allows not only to indentify specific genes, but also prividing an analytical instrument for the study of genome-wide regulatory networks. Finally, a third important element of this training, directly derived from the operational capabilities of IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR, is that it allows to integrate multiple layers of information in the analysis. Concretely, in order to evaluate the functional consequences of the isoform switching events, IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR allows to integrate information bout coding-potential, protein-domains, signal peptides and instrinsically disordered regions.</p>]]></content><author><name>Cristóbal Gallardo</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="new tutorial" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The GTN hosts a new training for analyzing alternative splicing at genome-wide scale!]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/images/isoform_usage_post.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/images/isoform_usage_post.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">BY-COVID and RO-Crate collaboration brings new topic: FAIR Data, Workflows &amp;amp; More</title><link href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2023/05/11/ro-crate.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="BY-COVID and RO-Crate collaboration brings new topic: FAIR Data, Workflows &amp;amp; More" /><published>2023-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2023/05/11/ro-crate</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2023/05/11/ro-crate.html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of the BY-COVID project, the RO-Crate team and BY-COVID members have
brought several RO-Crate related tutorials into the Galaxy Training Network, under a brand new Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable (FAIR) topic!</p>

<h2 id="what-are-ro-crates">What are RO-Crates?</h2>

<blockquote class="quote">
  <p>RO-Crate is a community effort to establish a lightweight approach to packaging research data with their metadata. It is based on schema.org annotations in JSON-LD, and aims to make best-practice in formal metadata description accessible and practical for use in a wider variety of situations, from an individual researcher working with a folder of data, to large data-intensive computational research environments. – <a href="https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/">RO-Crate Specification</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are <em>the</em> way to package up your research in a well annotated and <abbr title="Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable">FAIR</abbr> manner.</p>

<p>There are a number of <a href="https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/profiles.html">“profiles” within RO-Crates</a>, we are currently focused on the “Workflow Run” profile but we encourage you to look into the <a href="https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/profiles.html">other profiles</a></p>

<h2 id="whats-new-for-you">What’s new for you?</h2>

<p>As part of this collaboration we bring you several new tutorials:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/training-material/topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-workflow-run-ro-crate/tutorial.html">“Workflow Run RO-Crate Introduction”</a>, an introduction to RO-Crate profiles to represent workflow executions.</li>
  <li><a href="/training-material/topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-in-python/tutorial.html">“RO-Crate in Python”</a>, create your own RO-Crate from scratch! Find out what data is involved and what is possible with the format.</li>
  <li><a href="/training-material/topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-in-galaxy/tutorial.html">“Exporting Workflow Run RO-Crates from Galaxy”</a>, how do to export crates from Galaxy easily?</li>
  <li><a href="/training-material/topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-galaxy-best-practices/tutorial.html">“Best practices for workflows in GitHub repositories”</a>, and what to do with them after.</li>
  <li><a href="/training-material/topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-submitting-life-monitor/tutorial.html">“Submitting workflows to LifeMonitor”</a>, automation makes life easier!</li>
</ul>

<p>These tutorials are meant to help you learn how to use and create RO-Crates in your own work.</p>

<h2 id="where-can-i-learn-more">Where can I learn more?</h2>

<p>These tutorials will be taught at <a href="https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/events/smorgasbord3/">Smörgåsbord 3</a> so 
if you want to learn more, <a href="https://gxy.io/smorgasbord3-register">go sign up now!</a></p>

<h2 id="i-want-more-fair-training">I want more FAIR Training!</h2>

<p>While the addition of the RO-Crates tutorials marks the creation of a new Galaxy Training Network topic, <abbr title="Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable">FAIR</abbr> training, it currently only has tutorials focused on Research Objects and specifically the workflow profile. But watch this space! More tutorials are coming soon.</p>]]></content><author><name>Simone Leo, Paul De Geest, Stian Soiland-Reyes, Luca Pireddu, Marco Enrico Piras</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="new topic" /><category term="new feature" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the BY-COVID project, the RO-Crate team and BY-COVID members have brought several RO-Crate related tutorials into the Galaxy Training Network, under a brand new {FAIR} topic!]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/assets/images/BYCOVID_logo_tagline.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/assets/images/BYCOVID_logo_tagline.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">New Feature: my.galaxy.training</title><link href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2023/04/20/my-galaxy-training.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New Feature: my.galaxy.training" /><published>2023-04-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-04-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2023/04/20/my-galaxy-training</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2023/04/20/my-galaxy-training.html"><![CDATA[<p>The GTN has set up a very simple “redirection” service based on <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/">my.home-assistant.io</a> which Helena discovered after reading some Home Assistant documentation and saw a really neat link which led to her own internal home assistant.</p>

<p>So we have built a similar service for the GTN:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You write a URL like <a href="https://my.galaxy.training/?path=/workflows/list">https://my.galaxy.training/?path=/workflows/list</a></li>
  <li>A user visits this URL</li>
  <li>They’re asked for which Galaxy server is their ‘home’ server</li>
  <li>They will be redirected to that path, on that server, e.g. https://usegalaxy.eu/workflows/list</li>
</ol>

<p>We will be using this to implement a ‘button’ that users can click to directly import a workflow on their home server, and as a fallback for the “Click to Run” tools enabled by Tutorial Mode.</p>

<p>Additionally there is a <a href="https://my.gat.galaxy.training">my.gat.galaxy.training</a> which provides the same service for the Galaxy Admin Training workshop series. There we will use this feature to link admins directly to the VM they are working on when they’re working through the training and we need them to e.g. see something in their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/admin</code> page or in their tool data tables.</p>

<h2 id="potential-uses">Potential Uses</h2>

<p>Regardless of which server a user will use, in the cloud or locally, you can now link to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tools</li>
  <li>Galaxy UI pages:
    <ul>
      <li>Workflow editor</li>
      <li>Workflow import</li>
      <li>TRS import</li>
      <li>Visualisations</li>
      <li>etc!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="try-them-out">Try them out</h2>

<p>Both of these services can be used from today onwards!</p>

<p>We have already updated some Galaxy Admin training materials to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my.gat.galaxy.training</code>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Helena Rasche</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="new feature" /><category term="gtn" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The GTN has set up a very simple “redirection” service based on my.home-assistant.io which Helena discovered after reading some Home Assistant documentation and saw a really neat link which led to her own internal home assistant.]]></summary></entry></feed>
