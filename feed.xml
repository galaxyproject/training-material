&lt;p&gt;We, the Galaxy Training Network, would like to get feedback from instructors on the use of Galaxy for training, the preparation needed but also on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://training.galaxyproject.org/&quot;&gt;Galaxy Training Material&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This survey should take less than 10 minutes and every questions are optional and can be skipped. It will help us prioritise improvements to the training materials. We’re currently focused on making it easier to prepare and give trainings.&lt;/p&gt;

Writing the tutorials was always a bit awkward as you would spend a lot of time writing code blocks that would be copied and pasted by students into a terminal. We thought we could do better than that, so we decided we would try to convert these to Jupyter Notebooks where the students could read the training materials and simultaneously execute the code cells directly there with the text!

&lt;p&gt;The answers are automatically posted to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/issues/989&quot;&gt;GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt;. With &amp;gt; 1,300 answers, it is quite difficult to keep an eye on the answers, specially because the answers there are for all tutorials, but also to have an overview of the answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we have the feedback for a specific tutorial? Or for all the tutorials for a topic? How many feedback has been submitted? Are the tutorials appreciated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer some of these questions and help contributors, we created a &lt;a href=&quot;/training-material/feedback.html&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; which aggregate all feedback, display them globally, but also by topic and tutorials, including the free text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data from the feedback are automatically extracted every week to update the page and its graphs. The page is linked in the “Extras” menu on the top (with direct link to interesting section from topic and tutorial pages).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/training-material/feedback.html&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot;&gt;Visit the Feedback page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="news" /><category term="new feature" /><category term="contributors" /><summary type="html">As you have probably already seen, a feedback form is embedded on the bottom of each tutorial.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Accessibility Improvements</title><link href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2021/07/27/a11y.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Accessibility Improvements" /><published>2021-07-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-07-27T13:33:04+00:00</updated><id>https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2021/07/27/a11y</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2021/07/27/a11y.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility Improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our community members suggested on twitter that we support alternative formats for accessing our JavaScript based slides, as this can be difficult for users using screen readers. We’ve now added support for “plain text slides”, where we render the slide decks as a single long document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rendering is imperfect, due to how our slide deck library handles custom classes within slides, but it should still be an improvement for anyone who wants to scroll through the slides in an alternative format. You can find them linked from the first slide of each slide deck, or from the slides dropdown in the topic pages, &lt;em&gt;check them out!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally we’ve made a number of other minor accessibility improvements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed 533 missing alt texts for images&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Removed some repetitive icon names names when followed immediately by their descriptive text&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove repetitive image labels on author badges.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these were done after (&lt;a href=&quot;/training-material/hall-of-fame/hexylena/&quot; class=&quot;contributor-badge contributor-hexylena&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/hexylena?s=27&quot; alt=&quot;Avatar&quot; /&gt;Helena Rasche&lt;/a&gt;) learned to use Android’s TalkBack and noticed the site could be unpleasant to go through. While absolutely not a replacement for someone who deeply understands the needs of visually impaired users or experiences such needs themselves, hopefully this makes the GTN a little bit more pleasant for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="news" /><category term="new feature" /><summary type="html">Accessibility Improvements</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">New Tutorial: Mutation calling, viral genome reconstruction and lineage/clade assignment from SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data</title><link href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2021/06/30/tutorial-sars-cov-2-variant-discovery.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New Tutorial: Mutation calling, viral genome reconstruction and lineage/clade assignment from SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data" /><published>2021-06-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-06-30T08:36:29+00:00</updated><id>https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2021/06/30/tutorial-sars-cov-2-variant-discovery</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2021/06/30/tutorial-sars-cov-2-variant-discovery.html">&lt;p&gt;Effectively monitoring global infectious disease crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, requires capacity to generate and analyze large volumes of sequencing data in near real time.
