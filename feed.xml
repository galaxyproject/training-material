Genome annotation is a time consuming and largely manual process as it requires the synthesis of a significant amount of varied information to make inferences, a process tha cannot be accomplished without an interactive editor. To support this, Apollo was deployed on UseGalaxy.eu. Over the past two years the GGA project has pushed forward apollo and tooling around it, and it finally culminates in this look at how to annotated your genomes in Apollo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But genome annotation isn’t just a solitary activity, from bacterial genomes to larger, they require an entire team of people to do the annotation process which is how Apollo further makes this process easy; by acting like a “Google Docs for Genome Annotation”, providing a collaborative, real-time genome annotation framework, entire teams can work together simultaneously with Apollo, analysing their data in Galaxy, and sending the results back to Apollo.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="news" /><category term="new tutorial" /><category term="genome-annotation" /><summary type="html">After two years, the Galaxy Genome Annotation team has finally finished their much awaited tutorial on doing Genome Annotation in Galaxy!

&lt;p&gt;As the GTN is intended to be easy for contributors and easy for learners, we wanted to make use of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;abbr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tag which allows you to define commonly re-used terms in your HTML. However this is a bit clumsy to write every time, so we’ve implemented a tag and some metadata which permits easily defining and referencing abbreviations throughout your text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your tutorial metadata you can add an abbreviations section like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;My awesome tutorial&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;abbreviations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Application Programming Interface&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;JavaScript Object Notation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in your text you can use braces to refer to the term&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;code-2col&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;code-in&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;code-in-input-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;far fa-keyboard&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;code-in&lt;/span&gt; Input: Markdown&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
The `/jobs` &amp;lbrace;API&amp;rbrace; will return &amp;lbrace;JSON&amp;rbrace;. When we call the &amp;lbrace;API&amp;rbrace; we'll get back this result &amp;lbrace;JSON&amp;rbrace;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;code-out&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;code-out-output&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-laptop-code&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;code-out&lt;/span&gt; Output&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/jobs&lt;/code&gt; Application Programming Interface (API) will return JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). When we call the &lt;abbr title=&quot;Application Programming Interface&quot;&gt;API&lt;/abbr&gt; we’ll get back this result &lt;abbr title=&quot;JavaScript Object Notation&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
