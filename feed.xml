<h1 id="new-galaxy-training-genome-wide-alternative-splicing-analysis">New Galaxy training: Genome-wide alternative splicing analysis</h1>

<p>Isoform switching is a biological phenomenon that plays a crucial role in the regulation and diversity of gene expression. It refers to the process by which alternative splicing of pre-mRNA generates different mRNA isoforms that can produce distinct protein products under different conditions. Despite the fact that alternative splicing has been demonstrated to play a fundamental roles in a wide range of biological contexts, such as tissue-specific expression, disease development and evolutionary adaptation, isoform-based expression anaysis pipelines are still rare when compared with gene-level quantification studies.</p>

<p>This new Galaxy training explores the isoform switching concept and provides a step-by-step guide for analyzing this regulatory mechanism. It makes use of <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR.html">IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR</a>, a R package which integrates a multi-step analysis for isoform detection and functional prediction.</p>

<figure id="figure-1"><img src="/training-material/news/images/isoform_usage_post.jpg" alt="Overview of computational pipeline for isoform detection and functional prediction." width="1071" height="779" loading="lazy" /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> Adapted from Vitting-Seerup et Sandelin, 2017.</figcaption></figure>

<p>A second important aspect of this pipeline is that it allows to evaluate alternative splicing at two different levels: gene-specific and genome-wide scale. This dual-approach allows not only to indentify specific genes, but also prividing an analytical instrument for the study of genome-wide regulatory networks. Finally, a third important element of this training, directly derived from the operational capabilities of IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR, is that it allows to integrate multiple layers of information in the analysis. Concretely, in order to evaluate the functional consequences of the isoform switching events, IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR allows to integrate information bout coding-potential, protein-domains, signal peptides and instrinsically disordered regions.</p>]]></content><author><name>Cristóbal Gallardo</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="new tutorial" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The GTN hosts a new training for analyzing alternative splicing at genome-wide scale!]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/images/isoform_usage_post.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/images/isoform_usage_post.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">BY-COVID and RO-Crate collaboration brings new topic: FAIR Data, Workflows &amp;amp; More</title><link href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2023/05/11/ro-crate.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="BY-COVID and RO-Crate collaboration brings new topic: FAIR Data, Workflows &amp;amp; More" /><published>2023-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2023/05/11/ro-crate</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2023/05/11/ro-crate.html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of the BY-COVID project, the RO-Crate team and BY-COVID members have
brought several RO-Crate related tutorials into the Galaxy Training Network, under a brand new Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable (FAIR) topic!</p>

<h2 id="what-are-ro-crates">What are RO-Crates?</h2>

<blockquote class="quote">
  <p>RO-Crate is a community effort to establish a lightweight approach to packaging research data with their metadata. It is based on schema.org annotations in JSON-LD, and aims to make best-practice in formal metadata description accessible and practical for use in a wider variety of situations, from an individual researcher working with a folder of data, to large data-intensive computational research environments. – <a href="https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/">RO-Crate Specification</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are <em>the</em> way to package up your research in a well annotated and <abbr title="Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable">FAIR</abbr> manner.</p>

<p>There are a number of <a href="https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/profiles.html">“profiles” within RO-Crates</a>, we are currently focused on the “Workflow Run” profile but we encourage you to look into the <a href="https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/profiles.html">other profiles</a></p>

<h2 id="whats-new-for-you">What’s new for you?</h2>

<p>As part of this collaboration we bring you several new tutorials:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/training-material/topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-workflow-run-ro-crate/tutorial.html">“Workflow Run RO-Crate Introduction”</a>, an introduction to RO-Crate profiles to represent workflow executions.</li>
  <li><a href="/training-material/topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-in-python/tutorial.html">“RO-Crate in Python”</a>, create your own RO-Crate from scratch! Find out what data is involved and what is possible with the format.</li>

<p>So we have built a similar service for the GTN:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You write a URL like <a href="https://my.galaxy.training/?path=/workflows/list">https://my.galaxy.training/?path=/workflows/list</a></li>
  <li>A user visits this URL</li>
  <li>They’re asked for which Galaxy server is their ‘home’ server</li>
  <li>They will be redirected to that path, on that server, e.g. https://usegalaxy.eu/workflows/list</li>
</ol>

<p>We will be using this to implement a ‘button’ that users can click to directly import a workflow on their home server, and as a fallback for the “Click to Run” tools enabled by Tutorial Mode.</p>

<p>Additionally there is a <a href="https://my.gat.galaxy.training">my.gat.galaxy.training</a> which provides the same service for the Galaxy Admin Training workshop series. There we will use this feature to link admins directly to the VM they are working on when they’re working through the training and we need them to e.g. see something in their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/admin</code> page or in their tool data tables.</p>

<h2 id="potential-uses">Potential Uses</h2>

<p>Regardless of which server a user will use, in the cloud or locally, you can now link to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tools</li>
  <li>Galaxy UI pages:
    <ul>
      <li>Workflow editor</li>
      <li>Workflow import</li>
      <li>TRS import</li>
      <li>Visualisations</li>
      <li>etc!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="try-them-out">Try them out</h2>

<p>Both of these services can be used from today onwards!</p>

<p>We will now store this data within the GTN itself, and trainers can manage this data themselves. If you are a trainer that offers training courses in your local area, or are interested in helping others teach in that region, please feel free to update your Contributors profile with the new metadata:</p>

<p>And we’ll add a nice map to the GTN, and potentially the Galaxy Hub as well! The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contact_for_training</code> field is a true or false value which lets you indicate you’re open to being contacted regarding giving training. Other trainers in your region might use this if they’re looking for help giving a course or want experts in a field for a course they plan to host.

<p>Her cell line is the oldest and most commonly used human cell line <span class="citation"><a href="#Rahbari_2009">Rahbari <i>et al.</i> 2009</a></span>, and is the reason for large scale policy change, especially major regulatory changes in informed consent in the United States <span class="citation"><a href="#Beskow_2016">Beskow 2016</a></span>. Unfortunately none of these changes happened quickly, it took until 2013 before her descendants could have a say in how her genetic material is used in NIH research <span class="citation"><a href="#lacks_family_2013">University 2013</a></span>.</p>

<h2 id="johns-hopkins">Johns Hopkins</h2>

<p>Henrietta was a patient at Johns Hopkins Hospital; Johns Hopkins University employs many of the core Galaxy Developers.</p>

<p>Johns Hopkins has announced the construction of a new building named in her honor, specifically focusing on research around bioethics: “The building will support the Berman Institute of Bioethics, the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and additional departments, as well as collaborative space for education, research, and meetings.” <span class="citation"><a href="#jhu_construction_announcement">University 2022</a></span></p>

<blockquote class="quote">
  <p>Lacks’s case is one of many examples of the lack of informed consent in 20th century medicine. Communication between tissue donors and doctors was virtually nonexistent (i.e. cells were taken without patient consent, nor were they told what the cells would be used for). Johns Hopkins Hospital, where Lacks received treatment and had her tissue harvested, was the only hospital in the Baltimore area where African American patients could receive free care. The patients receiving free care from this segregated sect of the hospital often became research subjects without their knowledge. Lacks’s family also had no access to her patient files and had no say in who received HeLa cells or what they would be used for. Additionally, as HeLa cells were popularized and used more frequently throughout the scientific community, Lacks’s relatives received no financial benefit and continued to live with limited access to healthcare. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa#Controversy">via Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>We recommend the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Immortal_Life_of_Henrietta_Lacks">“The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks”</a> for further reading on the topic.</p>

<h2 id="gtn-connection">GTN Connection</h2>

<p>The GTN has four tutorials that make use of HeLa cell line data. After reading about Henrietta and her impact on science, you might be interested in following one of these tutorials to learn about the applications of her cells, two on imaging analysis:</p>

  <li><a href="/training-material/topics/imaging/tutorials/hela-screen-analysis/tutorial.html">Analyse HeLa fluorescence siRNA screen</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And two proteomics tutorials:</p>
