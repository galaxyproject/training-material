For example, you may need to change the file format, re-order columns in a table, replace certain values, or perform some filtering operation, before you can proceed to the next step of your analysis. Galaxy offers a wide range of tools that can perform such generic data manipulation tasks, and mastering these types of operations in Galaxy can help you streamline your analysis and get the most out of Galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a dataset containing historical Olympics results, this tutorial walks you through how to use a wide range of such generic data manipulation tools in Galaxy. These tools can be useful in any analysis, regardless of scientific domain.&lt;/p&gt;

The Vertebrate Genomes Project aims to generate high-quality, near-error-free, gap-free, chromosome-level, haplotype-phased, annotated reference genome assemblies for every vertebrate species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. VPG Pipeline 2.0. The pipeline starts with assembly of the HiFi reads into contigs, yielding the primary and alternate assemblies. Then, duplicated and erroneously assigned contigs will be removed by using purge_dups. Finally, Bionano optical maps and HiC data are used to generate a scaffolded primary assembly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tutorial organized in four sections: genome profile, HiFi phased assembly, post-assembly pocessing and hybrid scaffolding. During the genome profiling stage, diverse tools based on the analsys of k-mer frequencies are used for infering the properties of the genome. After that, a draft assembly is generated by using high accuracy long-read PacBio HiFi reads. In the third stage, the initial assembly is preprocessed for identifying and reassign allelic contigs. Finally, in the last step the assembed contigs are assembled into scaffolds by using two additional technologies: Bionano optical maps and Hi-C data.&lt;/p&gt;
