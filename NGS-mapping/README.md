Mapping of NGS data
===================

After [quality control](../NGS-QC/README.md), mapping sequences on reference genomes is the second step of most NGS data analysis process.

# Slides

Several deck of slides are available for this topic:

- [General introduction about mapping](http://bgruening.github.io/training-material/NGS-mapping/slides/)
- Slide deck related to the tutorials:
    - [Dive into mapping](http://bgruening.github.io/training-material/NGS-mapping/slides/dive_into_mapping.html)

# Tutorials

A tutorial with hands-on is available for this topic:

- [Dive into mapping](tutorials/dive_into_mapping.md)

## Input datasets

The input datasets for the tutorial will be available soon on Zenodo

## Galaxy instance

For these tutorials, you can use the [dedicated Docker image](docker/README.md):

```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 bgruening/galaxy-ngs-mapping-training
```

It will launch a flavored Galaxy instance available on
[http://localhost:8080 ](http://localhost:8080).
