> These Ansible roles and training materials were last tested on Centos 7 and Ubuntu 18.04, but will probably work on other RHEL and Debian variants.
>
> The roles that are used in these training are currently used by `usegalaxy.*`, and other, servers in maintaining their infrastructure. ([US](https://github.com/galaxyproject/infrastructure-playbook/), [EU](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook), both are running CentOS 7)
>
> If you have an issue running these trainings on your OS flavour, please report [the issue](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/issues/new) in the training material and we can see if it is possible to solve.
