>    > ### {% icon tip %} Hiding intermediate steps
>    > When a workflow is executed, the user is usually primarily interested in the final product and not in all intermediate steps. By default all the outputs of a workflow will be shown, but we can explicitly tell Galaxy which outputs to show and which to hide for a given workflow. This behaviour is controlled by the little asterisk next to every output dataset:
>    > ![Asterisk for `out_file1` in the `Select First` tool]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/introduction/images/101_foreveryone_workflow_editor_mark_output.png)
>    >
>    > If you click on this asterisk for any of the output datasets, then *only* files with an asterisk (in green) will be shown, and all outputs without an asterisk will be hidden. (Note that clicking *all* outputs has the same effect as clicking *none* of the outputs, in both cases all the datasets will be shown.)
