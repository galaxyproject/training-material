>    > ### {% icon tip %} Tip: Using the Scratchbook to view multiple datasets at once
>    > If you would like to view two or more datasets at once, you can use the **Scratchbook** feature in Galaxy:
>    >  1. **Click** on the *Scratchbook* icon {% icon galaxy-scratchbook%} on the top menu bar.
>    >     - You should see a little checkmark on the icon now
>    >  2. **View** {% icon galaxy-eye %} a dataset by clicking on the eye icon {% icon galaxy-eye %} to view the output
>    >     - You should see the output in a window overlayed over Galaxy
>    >     - You can resize this window by dragging the bottom-right corner
>    >  3. **Click** outside the file to exit the Scratchbook
>    >  4. **View** {% icon galaxy-eye %} a second dataset from your history
>    >     - You should now see a second window with the new dataset
>    >     - This makes it easier to compare the two outputs
>    >  5. Repeat this for as many files as you would like to compare
>    >  6. You can turn off the **Scratchbook** {% icon galaxy-scratchbook %} by clicking on the icon again
