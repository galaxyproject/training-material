The short version is we're a popular, FAIR training materials platform, and we want to be a home for your training materials.

## Your content in front of the world

As of June 2023 the GTN sees around 60k visitors per month. Please see [our public page view monitoring](https://plausible.galaxyproject.eu/training.galaxyproject.org?period=30d) for more details.

## FAIR

We go to great lengths to make sure our training platform is completely FAIR. See [this FAQ for the details on how we achieve that.]({% link faqs/gtn/fair_training.md %}). All of our materials have extensive [BioSchemas](https://bioschemas.org) markup ensuring they're easily accessible to search engines.
Our materials are automatically indexed by [TeSS](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/materials?content_provider=Galaxy+Training), and we are working on a WorkflowHub integration.

## Accessible

We regularly test our pages with a thorough suite of accessibility tools, as well as via screen reader.

## Not Just Galaxy

Our name can be a bit misleading! While a lot of our tutorials are focused on Galaxy, we have multiple growing topics which are unrelated to Galaxy.

- [ai4life]({% link topics/ai4life/index.md %})
- [FAIR]({% link topics/fair/index.md %})
- [Data Science]({% link topics/data-science/index.md %})

All of these topics are using the GTN as a platform to disseminate their materials far and wide.
