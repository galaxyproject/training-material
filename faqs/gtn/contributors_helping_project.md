In [issues](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/issues), you will find lists of issues to fix and features to implement (with the ["newcomer-friendly"]({{ site.github_repository }}/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Anewcomer-friendly) label for example). Feel free to work on them!
