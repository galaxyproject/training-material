All ways to use Galaxy are included in the [Galaxy Directory listing](https://galaxyproject.org/use).

Having one account at several public Galaxy servers expands your access to distinct data storage and computational resources, plus common and domain-specific analysis tools. 

When running your own private Galaxy server for routine analysis, publishing results at a public Galaxy server allows for worldwide access by others when you share your data: Histories, Workflows, and related assets.

Tips:
- **Teaching with Galaxy** We strongly recommend using Galaxyâ€™s Training Infrastructure as a Service ([TIaaS](https://usegalaxy-eu.github.io/tiaas)) for synchronous class work.
- **Public Galaxy** servers are appropriate for many analysis projects or for when sharing data or results publicly is a goal. These are also a great choice when learning on your own with [GTN](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) tutorials.
- **Private Galaxy** servers are more appropriate when working with very large data, time sensitive projects, and ongoing research projects that require more resources than the public Galaxy servers can support. These two options are scientist friendly as they require very little to no server administration.
    - [GVL Cloudman](https://galaxyproject.org/use/aws/) is a single or multi-user choice and AWS [offers grants](https://aws.amazon.com/grants/). 
    - [AnVIL](https://galaxyproject.org/use/anvil/) is a single-user choice sponsored by NHGRI and is a pay-for-use Google Cloud platform.
