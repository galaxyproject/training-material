The support channel for instructors is the same as for individual learners.  We suggest you start by posting a question to the Galaxy Training Network [Gitter chat]({{ site.gitter_url }}). Anyone can view the discussion, but you'll need to login (using your GitHub or Twitter account) to add to the discussion.

If you have questions about Galaxy in general (that are not training-centric) then there are [several support options](https://galaxyproject.org/support/).
