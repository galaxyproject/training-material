Registering for a Galaxy account
Having your own account on the public Test and/or Main server means that you can save histories, work with more data, and get the most out of Galaxy's functionality.

Accounts are created under the User masthead menu. This same menu is also where you will log in and out of Galaxy.

Be sure to note that the public Test and Main instance usage policies are one account per user, as stated in our Terms and Conditions. Also, make sure your email address is valid so that you can confirm your new account (emails are case sensitive) and so that our administrator can contact you if needed (rare, but you'll want the email!).

The activation email will include a link and an abbreviated terms of usage explaination:

By clicking on the above link and opening a Galaxy account, you are also confirming that you have read and agreed to Galaxy's Terms and Conditions for the use of this service (https://usegalaxy.org/static/terms.html). Terms include a quota limit of one account per user. Attempts to subvert this limit by creating multiple accounts or through any other method may result in termination of all associated accounts and data.

Most other public Galaxy servers have similar usage terms. Ask them if this is not clear, before multiple accounts are problems. Contact information for Galaxy servers is usually on the home page of the server and/or on that server's directory page.

Updating account preferences
Changed place of study/work and need to update your registered account address? Log into your existing account and update the email address under User > Preferences. DO NOT create another new account or it will be detected as a duplicate account. Any use of multiple accounts can result in data loss. FAQ: Reset password or Change email, username, password.

If you instead want to start over with a new account, delete your old account(s) first under User > Preferences, then create a new account.

Note: Updating a registered account email address will not prevent ongoing multiple/duplicate account detection. If you have more than one, existing or new or older, review below about how to clear that up. Use just one account and problems are avoided. Share data, not accounts.

Learning and Teaching
Teaching with Galaxy? New and learning how to use it? Review the help under the masthead Learn area.

If you need more help, review FAQs under the masthead Support area. The most common usage issues and reasons for tool errors are covered in detail.

You can also visit the Galaxy Help forum to review prior QA and to ask a new question.

Account questions or problems
If you are having problems with your account or have misunderstandings about terms of usage, contact the server administrators where you are working.

Protect your password and keep it private. Server administrators will never need or ask for it. Other people will never need it. Share data, not accounts.

Do not allow other people to log into or use your account, for any reason. Do not log into other people's accounts. Both can lead to duplicated account issues. Use Galaxy's built-in share functions for collaborative work. FAQ: Sharing and Publishing your work

If you have already found your account suspended due to the use of duplicates, or from directly logging into other people's accounts or they yours, act quickly to clear things up. This Galaxy Help post explains how and why to resolve account issues: Accounts deleted to enforce posted terms and conditions

Account problems that can be resolved include proactively clearing up existing multiple or duplicated accounts.

Manage your own data and delete old/extra accounts under User > Preferences.
Multiple accounts that are detected, suspended, and administratively managed, without followup on your part, result in data loss. Creating another account is not the solution -- the new account will also be detected up as a duplicate and removed.
You will not receive a special notification when accounts are administratively managed due to a breach of the terms of service. The original terms of service included directly on the account registration form and in the account activation emails are your notice.
Should you have questions, contact the server administrators to get issues resolved correctly.
