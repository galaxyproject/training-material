There are two distinct audiences for these materials.

1. **Self-paced individual learners.** These tutorials provide everything you need to learn a topic, from explanations of concepts to detailed hands-on exercises.
2. **Instructors.** They are also designed to be used by instructors in teaching/training settings. Slides, and detailed tutorials are provided. Most tutorials also include computational support with the needed tools, data as well as Docker images that can be used to scale the lessons up to many participants.
