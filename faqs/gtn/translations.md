The GTN currently supports two forms of translation:

- Manual (`tutorial_ES.md` and `slides_ES.html` for example)
- Automated (via linking through to Google Translate)

We accept manual translations if and only if there is a team that is able to commit to their maintenance. We need to ensure the trainings are kept up to date and high quality, but that requires native speakers of that language to maintain those translations.

Please contact us if you have any questions regarding translations.
