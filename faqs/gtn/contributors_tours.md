Perhaps you've been asked to review an interactive tour, or maybe you just want to try one out. The easiest way to run an interactive tour is to use the [Tour builder](https://tailordev.fr/blog/2017/07/19/the-galaxy-tour-builder-extension/) browser extension.

1. Install the Tour Builder extension to your browser ([Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/galaxy-tour-builder/mdfbapknmcpnbmggahhaegehbbbmhmgg), [Firefox add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/galaxy-tour-builder/)).
2. Navigate to a Galaxy instance supporting the tutorial. To find which Galaxy instances support each tutorial, please see the dropdown menu next to the tutorial on the training website. Using one of the usegalaxy.\* instances ([Galaxy Main](https://usegalaxy.org), [Galaxy Europe](https://usegalaxy.eu), or [Galaxy Australia](https://usegalaxy.org.au)
) is usually a good bet.
3. Start the Tour Builder plugin by clicking on the icon in your browser menu bar
4. Copy the contents of the `tour.yaml` file into the Tour builder editor window
5. Click `Save` and then `Run`
