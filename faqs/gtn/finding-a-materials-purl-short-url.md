Every material in the GTN is automatically assigned two short URLs:

- a [PURL](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2023/04/19/shortlinks.html) which will always point to the material, and looks like `https://gxy.io/GTN:T00001` - a tutorial ID based short URL like `https://gxy.io/GTN:admin/ansible-galaxy`, which will redirect to topics/admin/tutorials/ansible-galaxy/tutorial.md

The PURLs, when available, are listed in the Metadata box of a given material, or on the first slide of a slide deck. Additionally any page with a PURL lists it in the footer of the page. PURLs are generated every monday, so it can take up to a week for your PURL to be available. If you need it sooner, please let us know.

The second short URL is not currently displayed anywhere but can be constructed manually based on the URL of the page.
<!-- This should be in GTN not Galaxy FAQs and the current version of the form doesn't allow that. -->
