If you feel uncomfortable with using the git and the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), you can write a new tutorial with any text editor and then contact us (via [Gitter]({{ site.gitter_url }}) or [email](mailto:{{ site.email }})). We will work together to integrate the new content.
