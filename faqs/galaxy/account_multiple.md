- You ARE NOT allowed to create more than 1 account per Galaxy server.
- You ARE allowed to have accounts on different servers.


For example, you are allowed to have 1 account on Galaxy US, and another account on Galaxy EU, but never 2 accounts on the same Galaxy.

**WARNING: Having multiple accounts is a violation of the terms of service, and may result in deletion of your accounts.**

Need more disk space?
  - See [this tip]({% link faqs/galaxy/account_reduce_quota_usage.md %}) for ways to free up space in your account
  - [Contact the admins of your Galaxy server]({% link faqs/galaxy/support_admins.md %}) to ask about possibilities for temporarily increasing your quota.

Other tips:
  - Forgot your password? You can request a reset link in on the login page.
  - If you want to associate your account with a different email address, you can do so under **User -> Preferences** in the top menu bar
  - To start over with a new account, first delete your account(s) first before creating a new account. This can be done in **User -> Preferences** menu in the top bar.
