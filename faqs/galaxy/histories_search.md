To make it easier to find datasets in large histories, you can filter your history by keywords as follows:
  1. **Click** on the *search datasets* box at the top of the history panel.

     ![history search box]({% link /shared/images/history_search_datasets.png %})

  2. **Type** a search term in this box
     - For example a tool name, or sample name
  3. To undo the filtering and show your full history again, press on the *clear search* button {% icon galaxy-clear %} next to the search box
