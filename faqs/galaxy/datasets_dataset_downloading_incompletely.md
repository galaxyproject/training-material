1. Try using the Google Chrome web browser. Sometimes Chrome itself better supports continuous data transfers.
2. Use the command-line option instead. The data may really be too large to download OR your connection is slower. This can also be a faster way to download multiple datasets plus ensure a complete transfer (small or large data).
