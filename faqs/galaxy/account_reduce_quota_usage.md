* [**Download**](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/datasets_download_datasets.html) Datasets as individual files or entire Histories as an archive. Then *purge* them from the public server.
* **Transfer/Move** [Datasets](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/datasets_moving_datasets_between_galaxy_servers.html) or [Histories](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/histories_transfer_entire_histories_from_one_galaxy_server_to_another.html) to another Galaxy server, including your own Galaxy. Then purge.
* [**Copy**](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/histories_copy_dataset.html) your most important Datasets into a new/other History (inputs, results), then purge the original full History.
* [**Extract**](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/workflows_extract_from_history.html) a **Workflow** from the History, then purge it.
* **Back-up your work**. It is a best practice to download an archive of your FULL original Histories periodically, even those still in use, as a backup.

**Resources** Much discussion about all of the above options can be found at the [Galaxy Help forum](https://help.galaxyproject.org/).
