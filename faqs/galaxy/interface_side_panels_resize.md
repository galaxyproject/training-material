If you are working on a small screen, you might want to occasionally hide or resize Galaxy's side panels (tool panel on the left and history panel on the right), to create more space for the center panel.

- **Resize the side panels** by clicking (and holding) the vertical bars icon {% icon galaxy-panel-drag %}{% icon galaxy-panel-drag%} on the bottom inside corner of the panel, and dragging them to the size you want
- **Collapse the side panels** by clicking on the arrow icons {% icon galaxy-panel-collapse-left %} and {% icon galaxy-panel-collapse-right %} on the bottom outside corners. Click again to expand them.
