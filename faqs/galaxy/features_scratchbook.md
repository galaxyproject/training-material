If you would like to view two or more datasets at once, you can use the **Scratchbook** feature in Galaxy:
  1. **Click** on the *Scratchbook* icon {% icon galaxy-scratchbook%} on the top menu bar.
     - You should see a little checkmark on the icon now
  2. **View** {% icon galaxy-eye %} a dataset by clicking on the eye icon {% icon galaxy-eye %} to view the output
     - You should see the output in a window overlayed over Galaxy
     - You can resize this window by dragging the bottom-right corner
  3. **Click** outside the file to exit the Scratchbook
  4. **View** {% icon galaxy-eye %} a second dataset from your history
     - You should now see a second window with the new dataset
     - This makes it easier to compare the two outputs
  5. Repeat this for as many files as you would like to compare
  6. You can turn off the **Scratchbook** {% icon galaxy-scratchbook %} by clicking on the icon again
