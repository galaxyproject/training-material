   - Open the **History Options** {% icon galaxy-history-options %} menu at the top of your history panel and select "{% icon history-share %} Share or Publish" 
     - {% icon galaxy-toggle %} **Make History accessible**
     - A **Share Link** will appear that you give to others
   - Anybody who has this link can view and copy your history

2. **Publish your history**
   - {% icon galaxy-toggle %} **Make History publicly available in Published Histories**
   - Anybody on this Galaxy server will see your history listed under the *Published Histories* tab opened via the {% icon galaxy-histories-activity %} **Histories** activity

3. **Share only with another user**.
   - Enter an email address for the user you want to share with in the *Please specify user email* input below **Share History with Individual Users**
   - Your history will be shared only with this user.

4. **Finding histories others have shared with me**
   - Click on the {% icon galaxy-histories-activity %} **Histories** activity in the activity bar on the left
