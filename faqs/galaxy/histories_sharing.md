     - {% icon galaxy-toggle %} **Make History accessible**
     - A **Share Link** will appear that you give to others
   - Anybody who has this link can view and copy your history

2. **Publish your history**
   - {% icon galaxy-toggle %} **Make History publicly available in Published Histories**
   - Anybody on this Galaxy server will see your history listed under the *Shared Data* menu

3. **Share only with another user**.
   - Click the **Share with a user** button at the bottom
   - Enter an email address for the user you want to share with
   - Your history will be shared only with this user.

4. **Finding histories others have shared with me**
   - Click on **User** menu on the top bar
