If your history contains deleted datasets you will see {% icon galaxy-delete %} **"Include deleted"** button directly above dataset display.

To un-delete datasets:

- Type `deleted:true` in the search box
- Select datasets you want to un-delete
- Click the dropdown that would appear at the top of the history;
- Select **"Undelete"** option.

Alternatively, you can:

- click {% icon galaxy-delete %} **"Include deleted"** button directly above dataset display. This will cause deleted datasets to appear in history along with normal (un-deleted) datasets;
- deleted datasets are distinguished by having {% icon dataset-undelete %} within dataset box. Clicking on this icon will un-delete a given dataset;
