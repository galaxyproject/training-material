In case the dataset downloads incompletely:
- Use the _Google Chrome_ web browser. Sometimes Chrome works better at supporting continuous data transfers.
- Use the [command-line option]({% link faqs/galaxy/datasets_download_using_command_line.md %}) instead. The data may really be too large to download OR your connection is slower. This can also be a faster way to download multiple datasets plus ensure a complete transfer (small or large data).
