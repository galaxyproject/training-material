You can open some file types in Integrated Genome Browser (IGB), a desktop genome browser. ([Supported File Types](https://wiki.bioviz.org/confluence/display/igbman/File+Formats))

Here's how:

1. Install IGB on your computer ([download page](https://bioviz.org/download.html)).
2. Start IGB.
3. In Galaxy, click the desired dataset's name to expand it.
   - Check that the reference genome (dbkey) is set
   ([instructions]({% link faqs/galaxy/datasets_change_dbkey.html %})).
4. Click on the Charts icon {% icon galaxy-barchart %}
5. In the central panel, next to `display in IGB`, choose `View`.

When you choose "View" in Galaxy, your browser opens a new tab showing a page from BioViz.org. Check the newly opened page for next steps.

Having trouble? Working with a custom genome assembly not yet available in Galaxy or IGB?
