1. **Please make sure you are logged in**. At the top menu bar, you should see a section labeled “User”. If you see “Login/Register” here you are not logged in.

2. **Activate your account**. If you have recently registered your account, you may first have to activate it. You will receive an e-mail with an activation link.
  - Make sure to check your spam folder!

3. **Be patient**. Galaxy is a free service, when a lot of people are using it, you may have to wait longer than usual (especially for 'big' jobs, e.g. alignments).

4. **Contact Support**. If you really think something is wrong with the server, you can [ask for support]({{site.baseurl}}/faqs/galaxy/support.html)
