- Having your own account on the public Test and/or Main server means that you can save histories, work with more data, and get the most out of Galaxy's functionality.

- To create an account on the Galaxy platform visit the official website via (https://usegalaxy.org)

- Accounts are created under the User masthead menu. This same menu is also where you will log in and out of Galaxy.


- Be sure to note that the public Test and Main instance usage policies are one account per user, as stated in our Terms and Conditions. Also, make sure your email address is valid so that you can confirm your new account (emails are case sensitive) and so that our administrator can contact you if needed (rare, but you'll want the email!).

- The activation email will include a link and an abbreviated terms of usage explanation:

  By clicking on the above link and opening a Galaxy account, you are also confirming that you have read and agreed to Galaxy's Terms and Conditions for the use   of this service (https://usegalaxy.org/static/terms.html). 


- Most other public Galaxy servers have similar usage terms. Ask them if this is not clear, before multiple accounts are problems. Contact information for Galaxy servers is usually on the home page of the server and/or on that [server's directory page](https://galaxyproject.org/use/).
