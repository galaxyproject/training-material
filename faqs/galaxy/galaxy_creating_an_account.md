1 To create an account at any public Galaxy instance, choose your server from the available [Galaxy Platform](https://galaxyproject.org/use/).

2 Choose the server you would like to create an account on. There are 3 Galaxy servers, which are [UseGalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu/), [UseGalaxy.org (Main)](https://usegalaxy.org/) and 

  [UseGalaxy.org.au](https://usegalaxy.org.au/).

3 Click on "Login or Register" in the masthead. When logged in, a User menu becomes available that is specific to your account.

4 Please make sure your registered account email address is valid so you can confirm your new account, and our administrative support team can contact/reply to you when needed. Account email addresses are case sensitive. 

5 Wait for your account creation confirmation email (if it hasn't arrived yet, check your spam folder). It will include an activation link along with an abbreviated terms of service explanation.
