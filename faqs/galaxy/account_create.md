1. To create an account at any public Galaxy instance, choose your server from the available [list of Galaxy Platforms](https://galaxyproject.org/use/).

    There are 3 main public Galaxy servers: [UseGalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org/), [UseGalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu/), and [UseGalaxy.org.au](https://usegalaxy.org.au/).

2. Click on **"Login or Register"** in the masthead on the server.

   ![Login or Register on the top panel]({{site.baseurl}}/faqs/galaxy/images/login_register.png)

3. On the login page, find the **Register here** link and click on it.
4. Fill in the the registration form, then click on **Create**.

   Your account should now get created, but will remain inactive until you verify the email address you provided in the registration form.

5. Check for a **Confirmation Email** in the email you used for account creation.
6. Click on the **Email confirmation link** to fully activate your account.

   {% icon galaxy-info %} Delivery of the confimation email is blocked by your email provider or you mistyped the email address in the registration form?

   Please do **not** register again, but follow the [instructions to change the email address]({% link faqs/galaxy/user_preferences_manage_information.md %}) registered with your account! The confirmation email will be resent to your new address once you have changed it.
