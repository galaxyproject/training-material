- _Deleted datasets_ and _deleted histories_ containing datasets **are considered when calculating quotas**.
- _Permanently deleted datasets_ and _permanently deleted histories_ containing datasets **are not considered**.
- _Histories/datasets that are shared with you_ are only **partially considered** unless you import them.

**Note:** To reduce quota usage, refer to [How can I reduce quota usage while still retaining prior work (data, tools, methods)?](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/reduce_quota_usage.html) FAQ.
