- Files ending in `.gz` are compressed (zipped) files.
  - The `fastq.gz` format is a compressed version of a `fastq` dataset.
  - The `fastqsanger.gz` format is a compressed version of the `fastqsanger` datatype, etc.
- Compression saves space (and therefore your quota).
- Tools can accept the compressed versions of input files
- Make sure the datatype (compressed or uncompressed) is correct for your files, or it may cause tool errors.
