Most tools create log files as output, which can contain useful information about how the tool ran (`stdout`, or *standard output*), and what went wrong (`stderr`, or *standard error*).

To view these log files in Galaxy:
- Expand one of the outputs of the tool in your history
- Click on **View details** {% icon details %}
- Scroll to the **Job Information** section
  - Here you will find links to the log files (`stdout` and `stderr`).
