1. Log into your existing account and update the email address under **User > Preferences**. DO NOT create another new account or it will be detected as a duplicate account. Any use of multiple accounts can result in data loss.

2. If you instead want to start over with a new account, delete your old account(s) first under **User > Preferences**, then create a new account.

Note: Updating a registered account email address will not prevent multiple/duplicate account detection. If you have more than one, existing or new or older, review below about how to clear that up. Use just one account to avoid problems. Share data, not accounts.

* Manage your own data and delete old/extra accounts under **User > Preferences**.

* Multiple accounts that are detected, suspended, and administratively managed, without followup on your part, result in data loss. Creating another account is not the solution -- the new account will also be detected up as a duplicate and removed.

* You will not receive a special notification when accounts are administratively managed due to a breach of the terms of service. The original terms of service included directly on the account registration form and in the account activation emails are your notice.
