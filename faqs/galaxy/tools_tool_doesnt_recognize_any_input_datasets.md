The expected input datatype assignment is explained on the tool form. Review the input select areas and the help section below the Execute button. 

Understanding datatypes [FAQ]({% link faqs/galaxy/datatypes_understanding_datatypes.md %}).

No datasets or collections available? Solutions:

1. Upload or Copy an appropriate dataset for the input into the active history.
* To load new datasets, review the **Upload** tool and more choices under **Get Data** within Galaxy.
* To copy datasets from a different history into the active history see [this FAQ]({% link faqs/galaxy/histories_copy_dataset.md %}).
* To use datasets loaded into a shared Data Library see [this FAQ]({% link faqs/galaxy/datasets_import_from_data_library.md %}).
2. Resolve a datatype assignment incompatibility between the dataset and the tool. 
* To redetect a datatype see [this FAQ]({% link faqs/galaxy/datasets_detect_datatype.md %}).
* To convert a datatype see [this FAQ]({% link faqs/galaxy/datasets_convert_datatype.md %}).
* To change a datatype see [this FAQ]({% link faqs/galaxy/datasets_change_datatype.md %}).
3. Individual datasets and dataset collections are selected differently on tool forms. 
* To select a collection input on a tool form see [this FAQ]({% link faqs/galaxy/tools_select_collection.md %}).
