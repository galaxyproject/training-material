1. To review all histories in your account, look under **User > Histories** in the top menu bar.
2. At the top of the History list in the middle panel, click into Advanced Search.
3. Select status: all to review all of your active, deleted, and permanently deleted (purged) histories.
4. Histories in all states are listed for registered accounts. Meaning one will always find their data here if it ever appears to be "lost".
5. The exception can be if the History has been purged. This requires a double-confirmed user action. Permanently deleted/purged Histories may be removed from the server at any time. The content is removed at the time of purging (and cannot be retrieved, even by an administer), but the History may still be in the listing for reference, for some variable time period.
