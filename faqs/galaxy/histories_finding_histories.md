1. To review all histories in your account, go to **User > Histories** in the top menu bar.
2. At the top of the History listing, click on **Advanced Search**.
3. Set the status to all to view all of your active, deleted, and permanently deleted (purged) histories.
4. Histories in all states are listed for registered accounts. Meaning one will always find their data here if it ever appears to be "lost".
5. Note: Permanently deleted (purged) Histories may be fully removed from the server at any time. The data content inside the History is always removed at the time of purging (by a double-confirmed user action), but the purged History artifact may still be in the listing. Purged data content cannot be restored, even by an administrator.
