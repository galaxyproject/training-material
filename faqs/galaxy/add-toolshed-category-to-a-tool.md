1. Find the target tool in the [Galaxy Toolshed](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repository).
   
   Note: the easiest way to do this from the Galaxy interface is to (A) search for the tool, then (B) select the drop-down menu **See tool in toolshed**.
2. Follow the **Development respository** URL.
3. Go to the `.shed.yml` file.
4. In the `categories:` metadata section, add your Toolshed category (which must correspond to those already in the [Galaxy Toolshed](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repository).

Example format: 

```yaml
categories:
 - Single Cell
 - Spatial Omics
 - Transcriptomics
```
