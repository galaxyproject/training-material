If you can't find a tool you need for a tutorial on Galaxy, please:

1. **Check that you are using a compatible Galaxy server**
  - Navigate to the overview box at the top of the tutorial
  - Find the **"Supporting Materials"** section
  - Check **"Available on these Galaxies"**
  - If your server is not listed here, the tutorial is not supported on your Galaxy server
  - You can create an account on one of the supporting Galaxies

2. Use the **GTN-in-Galaxy** feature
  - Open your Galaxy server
  - Click on the {% icon curriculum %} icon on the top menu, this will open the GTN inside Galaxy.
  - Navigate to your tutorial
  - Tool names in tutorials will be blue buttons that open the correct tool for you
  - **Note:** this does not work for all tutorials (yet)
