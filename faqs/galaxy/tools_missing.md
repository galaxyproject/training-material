To use the tools installed and available on the Galaxy server:

1. At the top of the left tool panel, type in a tool name or datatype into the tool search box.
2. Shorter keywords find more choices.
3. Tools can also be directly browsed by category in the tool panel.

If you can't find a tool you need for a tutorial on Galaxy, please:

1. **Check that you are using a compatible Galaxy server**
  - Navigate to the overview box at the top of the tutorial
  - Find the **"Supporting Materials"** section
  - Check **"Available on these Galaxies"**
  - If your server is not listed here, the tutorial is not supported on your Galaxy server
  - You can create an account on one of the supporting Galaxies

2. Use the **Tutorial mode** feature
  - Open your Galaxy server
  - Click on the {% icon curriculum %} icon on the top menu, this will open the GTN inside Galaxy.
  - Navigate to your tutorial
  - Tool names in tutorials will be blue buttons that open the correct tool for you
  - **Note:** this does not work for all tutorials (yet)
