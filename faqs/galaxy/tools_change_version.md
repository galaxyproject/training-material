Tools are frequently updated to new versions. Your Galaxy may have multiple versions of the same tool available. By default, you will be shown the latest version of the tool.

**Switching to a different version** of a tool:
  - Open the tool
  - Click on the {% icon tool-versions %} versions logo at the **top right**
  - Select the desired version from the dropdown list
