Galaxy servers can have a lot of tools available, which can make it challenging to find the tool you are looking for. To help find your favourite tools, you can:

- **Keep a list of your favourite tools** to find them back easily later.
  - **Adding tools to your favourites**
    - Open a tool
    - Click on the **star icon** {% icon galaxy-star %} next to the tool name to add it to your favourites
  - **Viewing your favourite tools**
    - Click on the **star icon** {% icon galaxy-star %} at the top of the Galaxy tool panel (above the tool search bar)
    - This will filter the toolbox to show all your starred tools


- **Change the tool panel view**
  - Click on the {% icon galaxy-panelview %} icon at the top of the Galaxy tool panel (above the tool search bar)
  - Here you can view the tools by EDAM ontology terms
    - EDAM Topics (e.g. biology, ecology)
    - EDAM Operations (e.g. quality control, variant analysis)
    - You can always get back to the default view by choosing **"Full Tool Panel"**
