- To review all active Datasets in your account, go to **User > Datasets**.

Notes:
- Logging out of Galaxy while the Upload tool is still loading data can cause uploads to abort. This is most likely to occur when a dataset is loaded by browsing local files.
- If you have more than one browser window open, each with a different Galaxy History loaded, the Upload tool will load data into the most recently used history.
- Click on refresh icon {% icon galaxy-refresh %} at the top of the History panel to display the current active History with the datasets.
