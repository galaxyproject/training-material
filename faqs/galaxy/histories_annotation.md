Sometimes tags and names are not enough to describe the work done within a history. Galaxy allows you to create history
annotations: longer text entries that allow for more formatting options. The formatting of the text is preserved. Later, if
you publish or share the history, the annotation will be displayed automatically - allowing you to share additional
notes about the analysis. Multiple lines, spaces, and emoji! üòπüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüåà can be used while writing annotations. 

To annotate a history:

1. Click on {% icon galaxy-pencil %} (**Edit**) next to the history name. A larger text section will appear displaying any
  existing annotation or `Annotation (optional)` if empty.
2. Add your text. <kbd>Enter</kbd> will move the cursor to the next line. (Tabs cannot be
  entered since the 'Tab' button is used to switch between controls on the page - tabs can be pasted in, however).
3. Click on **Save** {% icon galaxy-save %}.
4. To cancel, click the {% icon galaxy-undo %} "Cancel" button.
