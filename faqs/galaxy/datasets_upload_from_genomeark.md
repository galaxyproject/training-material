1. Open the file {% icon galaxy-upload %} __upload__ menu
2. Click on **Choose remote files** tab
3. Click on the **Genome Ark** button and then click on **species**

You can find the data by following this path: `/species/${Genus}_${species}/${specimen_code}/genomic_data`. Inside a given datatype directory (*e.g.* `pacbio`), select all the relevant files individually until all the desired files are highlighted and click the <kbd>Ok</kbd> button. Note that there may be multiple pages of files listed. Also note that you may not want every file listed.
