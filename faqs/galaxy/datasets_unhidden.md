If your history contains hidden datasets you will see {% icon galaxy-show-hidden %} **"Include hidden"** button directly above the dataset display.

To un-hide datasets:

- Type `visible:hidden` in the search box
- Select datasets you want to un-hide
- Click the dropdown that would appear at the top of the history;
- Select **"Unhide"** option.

Alternatively, you can:

- click {% icon galaxy-show-hidden %} **"Include hidden"** button directly above dataset display. This will cause hidden datasets to appear in history along with normal (un-hidden) datasets;
- hidden datasets are distinguished by having {% icon galaxy-show-hidden %} within dataset box. Clicking on this icon will un-hide a given dataset;
