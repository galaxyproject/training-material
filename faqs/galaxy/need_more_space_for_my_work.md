4. Reduce quota usage while still retaining prior work (data, tools, methods)
	* Download Datasets as individual files or entire Histories as an archive. Then purge them from the public server.
	* Copy Datasets or Histories to another Galaxy server, including your own Galaxy. Then purge.
	* Extract a Workflow from the History, then purge it.

 Histories and datasets that are deleted can be undeleted, but once  they are purged they cannot be recovered, even by an administrator.
