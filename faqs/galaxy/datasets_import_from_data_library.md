As an alternative to uploading the data from a URL or your computer, the files may also have been made available from a *shared data library*:

* Go into **Shared data** (top panel) then **Data libraries**
* Navigate to
{% if include.path %}
  *{{ include.path }}* or {% endif %} the correct folder as indicated by your instructor
* Select the desired files
* Click on the **To History** button near the top and select **{{ include.astype | default: "as Datasets" }}** from the dropdown menu
* In the pop-up window, select the history you want to import the files to (or create a new one)
* Click on **Import**
