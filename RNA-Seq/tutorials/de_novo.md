# Introduction

The data provided here are part of a Galaxy tutorial that analyzes RNA-seq data from a study published by *Wu et al.* in 2014 [DOI:10.1101/gr.164830.113](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2014/10/12/gr.164830.113.abstract). The goal of this study was to investigate "the dynamics of occupancy and the role in gene regulation of the transcription factor Tal1, a critical regulator of hematopoiesis, at multiple stages of hematopoietic differentiation." To this end, RNA-seq libraries were constructed from multiple mouse cell types including G1E - a GATA-null immortalized cell line derived from targeted disruption of GATA-1 in mouse embryonic stem cells - and megakaryocytes. This RNA-seq data was used to determine differential gene expression between G1E and megakaryocytes and later correlated with Tal1 occupancy. This dataset (GEO Accession: GSE51338) consists of biological replicate, paired-end, poly(A) selected RNA-seq libraries. Because of the long processing time for the large original files, we have downsampled the original raw data files to include only reads that align to chromosome 19 and a subset of interesting genomic loci identified by Wu *et al*.

# Analysis strategy

The goal of this exercise is to identify what transcripts are present in the G1E and megakaryocyte cellualr states and which transcripts are differentially expressed between the two states. We will use a *de novo* transcript reconstruction stratgey to infer transcript structures from the mapped reads in the absence of the actual annotated transcript structures. This will allow us to identify novel transcripts and novel isoforms of known transcripts, as well as identify differentially expressed transcripts.

Due to the large size of this dataset, we have downsampled it to only inlcude reads mapping to chromosome 19 and certain loci with relevance to hematopoeisis. This data is avaialble at [`Zenodo`](https://zenodo.org/record/254485), where you can find the forward and reverse reads corresponding to replicate RNA-seq libraries from G1E and megakaryocyte cells and an annotation file of RefSeq transcripts we will use to generate our transcriptome database.

## Quality control

For quality control, we use similar tools as described in [NGS-QC tutorial](../../NGS-QC/tutorials/dive_into_qc): [FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic).

Now that we have trimmed our reads and are fortuante that there is a reference genome assembly for mouse, we will align our trimmed reads to the genome.

# Mapping

To make sense of the reads, their positions within mouse genome must be determined. This process is known as aligning or 'mapping' the reads to the reference genome.

> ### :nut_and_bolt: Comment

> Do you want to learn more about the principles behind mapping? Follow our [training](../../NGS-mapping)
> {: .comment}

In the case of a eukaryotic transcriptome, most reads originate from processed mRNAs lacking introns. Therefore, they cannot be simply mapped back to the genome as we normally do for reads derived from DNA sequences. Instead, the reads must be separated into two categories:

- Reads contained within mature exons - these align perfectly to the reference genome
- Reads that span splice junctions in the mature mRNA - these align with gaps to the reference genome

Spliced mappers have been developed to efficiently map transcript-derived reads against genomes. [`HISAT`](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml) is an accurate and fast tool for mapping spliced reads to a genome. Another popular spliced aligner is [`TopHat`](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml), but we will be using `HISAT` in this tutorial.

# De novo transcript reconstruction
Now that we have mapped our reads to the mouse genome with `HISAT`, we want to determine transcript structures that are represented by the aligned reads. This is called *de novo* transcriptome reconstruction. This unbiased approach permits the comprehensive identification of all transcripts present in a sample, including annotated genes, novel isoforms of annotated genes, and novel genes. While common gene/transcript databases are quite large, they are not comprehensive, and the *de novo* transcriptome reconstruction approach ensures complete transcriptome(s) identification from the experimental samples. The leading tool for transcript reconstruction is `Stringtie`. Here, we will use `Stringtie` to predict transcript structures based on the reads aligned by `HISAT`.

# Transcriptome assembly

We just generated four transcriptomes with `Stringtie` representing each of the four RNA-seq libraries we are analyzing. Since these were generated in the absence of a reference transcriptome, and we ultimately would like to know what transcript structure corresponds to which annotated transcript (if any), we have to make a **transcriptome database**. We will use the tool `Cuffmerge` to combine redundant transcript structures across the four samples, provide non-redundant identifiers, and with the help of a reference annotation file annotate the nature/origin of each transcript (reference, novel isoform, intergenic transcript, antisense, etc.)

# Analysis of the differential gene expression

We just generated a transriptome database that represents the transcripts present in the G1E and megakaryocytes samples. This database provides the location of our transcripts with non-redundant identifiers, as well as information regarding the origin of the transcript.

We now want to identify which transcripts are differentially expressed between the G1E and megakaryocyte cellular states. To do this we will implement a counting approach using `FeatureCounts` to count reads per transcript. Then we will provide this information to `DESeq2` to generate normalized transcript counts (abundance estimates) and significance testing for differential expression.

## Count the number of reads per transcript

To compare the abundance of transcripts between different cellular states, the first essential step is to quantify the number of reads per transcript. [`FeatureCounts`](http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/featureCounts/) is one of the most popular tools for counting reads in genomic features. In our case, we'll be using `FeatureCounts` to count reads aligning in exons of our `Cuffmerge` generated transcriptome database.

The recommended mode is "union", which counts overlaps even if a read only shares parts of its sequence with a genomic feature and disregards reads that overlap more than one feature.

## Perform differential gene expression testing

Transcript expression is estimated from read counts, and attempts are made to correct for variability in measurements using replicates. This is absolutely essential to obtaining accurate results. We recommend having at least two biological replicates.

[`DESeq2`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) is a great tool for differential gene expression analysis. It takes read counts produced by `FeatureCounts` and applies size factor normalization:

- Computation for each gene of the geometric mean of read counts across all samples
- Division of every gene count by the geometric mean
- Use of the median of these ratios as sample's size factor for normalization

The first output of `DESeq2` is a tabular file. The columns are:

1.	Gene identifiers
2.	Mean normalized counts, averaged over all samples from both conditions
3.	Logarithm (base 2) of the fold change (the values correspond to up- or downregulation relative to the condition listed as Factor level 1)
4.	Standard error estimate for the log2 fold change estimate
5.	[Wald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wald_test) statistic
6.	*p*-value for the statistical significance of this change
7.	*p*-value adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure which controls false discovery rate ([FDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate))

In addition to the list of genes, `DESeq2` outputs a graphical summary of the results, useful to evaluate the quality of the experiment:

1. Histogram of *p*-values for all tests

    ![](../images/DESeq2_pval.png)

2. [MA plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MA_plot): global view of the relationship between the expression change of conditions (log ratios, M), the average expression strength of the genes (average mean, A), and the ability of the algorithm to detect differential gene expression. The genes that passed the significance threshold (adjusted p-value < 0.1) are colored in red.

    ![](../images/DESeq2_MAplot.png)

3. Principal Component Analysis ([PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)) and the first two axes

    ![](../images/DESeq2_PCAplot.png)

    Each replicate is plotted as an individual data point. This type of plot is useful for visualizing the overall effect of experimental covariates and batch effects.

4. Heatmap of sample-to-sample distance matrix: overview over similarities and dissimilarities between samples

    ![](../images/DESeq2_heatmap_G1E_mega.png)

5. Dispersion estimates: gene-wise estimates (black), the fitted values (red), and the final maximum a posteriori estimates used in testing (blue)

    ![](../images/DESeq2_dispersion1.png)

    This dispersion plot is typical, with the final estimates shrunk from the gene-wise estimates towards the fitted estimates. Some gene-wise estimates are flagged as outliers and not shrunk towards the fitted value. The amount of shrinkage can be more or less than seen here, depending on the sample size, the number of coefficients, the row mean and the variability of the gene-wise estimates.


For more information about `DESeq2` and its outputs, you can have a look at [`DESeq2` documentation](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/DESeq2/man/DESeq2.pdf).

# Visualization
Now that we have a list of transcript expression levels and their differential expression levels, it is time to visually inspect our transcript structures and the reads they were predicted from. It is a good practice to visually inspect (and present) loci with transcripts of interest. Fortuantely, there is a built-in genome browser in Galaxy, **Trackster**, that make this task simple (and even fun!).

In this last section, we will convert our aligned read data from BAM format to bigWig format to simplify observing where our stranded RNA-seq data aligned to. We'll then initiate a session on Trackster, load it with our data, and visually inspect our interesting loci.

# Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have analyzed real RNA sequencing data to extract useful information, such as which genes are up- or down-regulated by depletion of the Pasilla gene and which genes are regulated by the Pasilla gene. To answer these questions, we analyzed RNA sequence datasets using a reference-based RNA-seq data analysis approach. This approach can be sum up with the following scheme:
