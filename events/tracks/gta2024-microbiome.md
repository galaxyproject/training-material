title: Microbiome analysis
description: This track explains the capability to analyze microbiome data using Galaxy, covering essential tasks such as amplicon analysis and its visualization. It progresses to more advanced topics, including assembly and binning - the requirements for reconstructing Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) from microbiome samples, and finally extends to complex analyses like metatranscriptome studies and pathogen detection. Start with the tutorial at your own pace. If you need support contact us via the Slack Channel [#gta_microbiome](https://gtnsmrgsbord.slack.com/archives/C07NA7FSGR4). Please note that the tutorials of this track where all tested successfully on useGalaxy.eu, therefore it is recommended to run all tools on this server !
