title: Transcriptomics
description: Welcome to the transcriptomics track. Here you can learn how to map the raw RNA-seq sequencing data to a reference, preform an differential expression analysis, GO analysis. Further you can learn how to plot your processed data. Additionally you can also learn how to perform a differential Isofrom expression analysis, as well as how to annotate lncRNAs. If you want to learn more in the field of transciptomics please also have a look at the single cell track. Start with the tutorial at your own pace. If you need support contact us via the Slack Channel [gta_transcriptomics](https://gtnsmrgsbord.slack.com/archives/C07NGRVEG8J).
