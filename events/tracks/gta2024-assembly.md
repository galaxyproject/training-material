  - section: "Genome Assembly"
    description: |
      In this section, we will present genome assemblies for different types of organisms.

  - section: "Non-nuclear genome assembly"
    description: |
      When sequencing organisms with non-nuclear DNA, the data contain sequencing for both nuclear and non-nuclear DNA. In this section we will learn how to assemble organelles genome.
