"Many hands make small work, and together, we can continue offering free, comprehensive single-cell training to scientists across the globe!"

Join us for a day-long event (live on Zoom, although you're very welcome to join asynchronously) to improve Galaxy single-cell training resources! Tasks range from editing typos or improving explanations, to testing a tutorial or adding automated workflow testing.

## We expect four types of attendees:

 - Single-cell bioinformaticians who do not use Galaxy
 - New Galaxy single-cell users
 - Experienced Galaxy contributors
 - Experienced Galaxy SPOC contributors

## To join

See our [event doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GRAY_uE3dtyaGlKR7rqCXgjrJQUkgch-eyc7AsipYMc/edit?tab=t.k5a3rg712bse) for more details, a link to add it to your calendar, and information on what (brief) training you may need to do beforehand. Registration is not required, but welcome so that we can estimate numbers!

"First and foremost Galaxy CoFests are about growing the community of future contributors."
