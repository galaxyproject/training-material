    description: |
      There were unusually high rates of TB cases in your country this year. To characterize the underlying
      bacterial strains driving the epidemic, isolates have been sent for whole-genome sequencing.  Doctors and public
      health authorities request information in order to take decisions. In this course it will be demonstrated how
      you would make use of NGS to answer several questions relevant for patient and public health system management
      such as:
        - Are there cases of drug resistant bacteria?
        - Is there transmission of drug resistance?
        - Is there evidence of de novo emergence of resistance?
        - Are there multiple infections per patient?
        - Do we have on-going transmission?

      We hope that at the end of the different training sessions you can answer this question on your own and can apply what you have learnt to your own data!

      The 20 strains isolated in your country have been sequenced with
      Illumina technology to obtain whole-genome sequences. In this part
      of the workshop you will learn how to analyse those sequences.

      In a typical bioinformatic pipeline you would store your sequences
      in a computer server where all necessary software would be
      installed. This would be a server running the operating system
      LINUX, which is the most efficient way to run bioinformatics
      pipelines (more on this on Day 4). You will be running your
      analysis in a LINUX server from Galaxy, but instead of writing
      directly commands to execute operations in the server, you will be
      executing operations through a Galaxy graphical interface. This
      allows you to have access to a LINUX server and to run workflows
      without knowing LINUX. Importantly, for training purposes it also
      allows you to dedicate more attention in trying to understand what
      is being done in each of the steps without having to understand the
      programing behind. This being said, working directly on a LINUX
      cluster provides you always more flexibility, but if you don’t have
      access to one, Galaxy is a very good alternative for data analysis.

  - section: "Session 1: Learning Galaxy"
    description: |
        You will need to understand how to use Galaxy to run all the hands-
        on tutorials and therefore is highly recommended that you follow
        the next webinar and hands-on on Galaxy. The good thing about this
        is that once you know how it works, you can use it to run your own
        analysis with your own data.

    async: true
    description: |
      Let us imagine that you have received the sequences of the 20 strains, the first step is to assess the quality of sequencing. Once we are sure that the sequencing worked well, we typically compare our sequencing results to a reference genome (re-sequencing approach) by using a bioinformatics procedure usually called mapping. After, we will identify the genomic variants in our sequences with respect to the reference genome, a bioinformatics procedure called, variant calling. Once we are certain of the variants we have identified, usually we are interested in determining to what genes they belong, to what pathways, or for instance if they are likely to disrupt protein function. This procedure is called annotation. Once we have gone through each of these steps we are ready to analyse drug resistant patterns, draw phylogenetic relationships or identify clusters of transmission of M. tuberculosis.

      You are now ready for performing bioinformatic analysis in Galaxy. Before we start we would like you to watch a short video on how Illumina sequencing works. Following that video we have prepared a webinar on mapping and variant calling of Illumina applied to MTBC. After watching it you will be hopefully able to know; how a reference genome is chosen, why we typically ignore some regions of the MTBC genomes or what is the difference between a fixed and a variable SNP and why do we care about it (among other things).

      The use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for antibiotic resistance prediction and routine
      typing of bacterial isolates has increased substantially in recent years. To date a
      multitude of solutions for analyzing WGS data of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex
      (MTBC) data have been developed. In the first part of the 4th day of this workshop, we
      introduce some freely available webtools and open source pipelines designed to analyze
      MTBC sequence data and we’ll provide some examples of how these tools work and how to
      interpret the results.

      On Day 2 and 3 you have learned how you could use galaxy for analysing your own data.
      Establishing your own workflows in galaxy would allow you combining different tools and
      build your own pipeline without having to know how to program. If you are not so
      interested in having your own pipeline, webtools for WGS analysis can be very useful, as
      we have shown in the previous session.

      However, in the last part of the training we would like to convey to you what it would
      take if would want to run Linux via the command line.  The Linux operating system will be
      introduced, how to perform basic tasks using the Unix shell and how to install and run
      pipelines on the command line. You will learn the power of the Unix shell in performing
      complex and powerful tasks, often with just a few keystrokes or lines of code. In fact,
      Unix shell helps users automate repetitive tasks and easily combine smaller tasks into
      larger, more powerful workflows (i.e. pipelines). Use of the shell is fundamental to a
      wide range of advanced computing tasks, including high-performance computing. These
      webinars will introduce you to this powerful tool. Which approach to choose, Galaxy
      workflows, Webtools or native Linux depends on your needs, your interests and what
      computer resources you have available.

These series of webinars and tutorials aim at improving basic and applied knowledge associated with next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and their applications in the field of Tuberculosis (TB).

The trainings will introduce scalable and reproducible data analysis with Galaxy of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* complex (MTBC) genomes.

A series of pre-recorded sessions and hands-on tutorials will show:
  - How to differentiate sequencing technologies and which ones are most commonly applied in TB and how **(Day 1)**
  - How NGS can be implement into TB laboratories **(Day 1)**
  - How to do mapping and variant calling **(Day 2)**
  - How to detect drug resistance conferring mutations, build phylogenetic trees and infer tuberculosis transmission **(Day 3)**
  - How to use different web tools dedicated to targeted analysis and what it takes to do bioinformatics **(Day 4)**.

After the trainings all participants are expected to:
  - Describe how NGS is being used in TB research and clinical pratice
  - Extract MTBC genomic variants from short sequencing reads
  - Identify drug resistant mutations
  - Identify genetic relationships and interpret a phylogenetic trees
  - Use web applications designed for M. tuberculosis

## Communication

- Chat on Slack channel [#event-mtb-ngs](https://gtnsmrgsbord.slack.com/?redir=%2Farchives%2FC01MNM98X9V%3Fname%3DC01MNM98X9V) (see "Setup" for instructions)
- Scheduled Questions & Answer sessions (Q&A) on [Zoom](https://swisstph.zoom.us/j/88614333103?pwd=OVVjeG04a2lVMXB0THUxMXoxNUNkdz09)
- Check your time correspondence with [this time zone converter](https://time.is/compare)

A Slack channel will allow participants to communicate in real-time via chat. The channel should be used to troubleshoot and to get to know each other.
There will be scheduled zoom sessions (Q&A) every day where you can meet the experts, discuss and ask questions (check the program to know the time and be aware of the difference in time zone).
If you are in Asia you can attend the zoom sessions in the morning, if you are in America you can attend the sessions in the afternoon, no need to be there all the time.

## Certificates

Requirements for acquiring a certificate:
- Being registered in the training
- Join us on Slack! (see "Setup" for instructions)
- Answer the assessments of days 1,2 and 3
- Fill the [Feedback Survey](https://forms.gle/6Xn8WudBvr3NMC3W7	)
- As you finish the hands-on tutorials share your Galaxy history with us. See [how to do this here](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/histories_sharing.html) and copy the url link in [this table](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K2k_yzk14VIHjsedfHaUFJnLgq6JTweG2tqxmIKUM2M/edit?usp=sharing)
