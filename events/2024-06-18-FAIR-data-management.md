description: |
    This course will introduce the Galaxy Platform, covering the basic functionality for single-cell data processing. It will include an overview of various common single-cell datatypes used in bioinformatics. Participants will gain hands-on experience loading single-cell data from external resources into Galaxy, parsing academic literature to find relevant metadata, and converting the data into the common AnnData format, ready for further analysis in Galaxy.
