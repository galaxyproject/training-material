    description: |
      Over the course of these three days, you can choose your preferred track and learn how to use Galaxy for data analysis in this research field. If you find multiple topics interesting, feel free to explore more than one track. Each track will guide you through the process, from basic to more advanced analyses, to accommodate learners of all levels.

      For assistance, you can access support through the Slack channel associated with each track module. Please note that while we strive to accommodate all time zones, responses to specific questions may take a bit longer depending on the availability of experts in your time zone.

# Welcome to the Galaxy Training Academy
Do you want to learn how to use Galaxy, a open source data analysis platform? Then you are at the right place. We offer here a **5-day Global Online and Asynchronous learning event**.

We provide you with training materials which you can study at your own pace and on your own time throughout the week. Don't worry, asynchronous does not mean that you are alone! If you ever need help, you can contact one of our many trainers worldwide via **Slack chat** .


On the first day you can make yourself familiar with the Galaxy platform. In the next days you can follow different tracks, please go to the program tab for more informaiton.

You can set your own pace on your learning journey using our provided self-learning materials. Next to the program, you will find Slack channels you can join to exchange with the trainers and other participants during the event. Here you will also find help if you have qustions or run into an issue during the training. We try to cover all time zones with helpers for each topic, but please be patient if you do not get an immediat response.

You only need a browser and an account on one of the galaxy instances registered for this event. Please have a look at the setup tab.

**Certificates:** You can earn a certificate for the tracks you attended by answering a short questionnaire to verify your participation.
