## My History is missing! (Finding Histories)
1. To review all Histories in your account, look under User > Histories.
2. At the top of the History list in the middle panel, click into Advanced Search.
3. Select status: all to review all of your active, deleted, and permanently deleted (purged) histories.
4. Histories in all states are listed for registered accounts. Meaning one will always find their data here if it ever appears to be "lost".
5. The exception can be if the History has been purged. This requires a double-confirmed user action. Permenently deleted/purged Histories may be removed from the server at any time. The content is removed at the time of purging (and cannot be retrieved, even by an administer), but the History may still be in the listing for reference, for some variable time period.

# Datasets FAQs

## My Dataset is missing (Finding Datasets)
1. To review all active Datasets in your account, look under User > Datasets.
2. Logging out of Galaxy while the Upload tool is still loading data can cause uploads to abort. This is most likely to occur when a dataset is loaded by browsing local files.
3. If you had more than one browser window open, each with a different Galaxy History loaded, the Upload tool will load data into the most recently used history (even if that the view where you originally started the Upload job).
4. TIP Refresh the view to display the current active History (double-circle icon at the top of the History panel). Histories views are cashed by browsers. If your data ended up in an expected History, or if you simply want to organize data, use the History (gear icon) > "Copy Datasets" function. Exact copies of your own Datasets in multiple Histories do not consume any additional quota space.

## Download datasets
1. Opening the datasets found under hsitory
2. Clicking on the disk icon inside the dataset

## Dataset downloading incompletely?
1. Try using the Google Chrome web browser. Sometimes Chrome itself better supports continuous data transfers.
2. Use the command-line option instead. The data may really be too large to download OR your connection is slower. This can also be a faster way to download multiple datasets plus ensure a complete transfer (small or large data).

## Dataset(s) not downloading at all?
1. Check to see if pop-ups are blocked by your web browser. Where to check can vary by browser and extensions.
2. Double check your API key, if used. User > Preferences > Manage API key
3. Check the sharing/permission status of the Datasets.

## Moving data between Galaxy servers
1. Click on name of file to expand the info.
2. Right click on Save icon > Copy Link. Note that for BAM files the Save (Download) icon provides access to both alignment (BAM) and index (BAI) files. For BAM files use left mouse click to access BAM and index files. Move the cursor over the BAM file and use the right click to copy the link.
3. On another Galaxy server: go to upload menu > Paste / Fetch Data and paste the link. Select attributes, such as genome assembly, if required. Hit the Start button.

# Tool FAQ

## Tool doesn't recognize any input datasets
1. Convert Format or modify the datatype using the dataset's pencil icon to reach the Edit Attributes form.
2. Many attributes can be edited on these forms, including datatype, database, and other metadata.
3. You may need to first create a Custom Build and assign that as a database when using a Custom Reference Genome.

# Other FAQ (Privacy)

## How is the server I'm working at configured?
On the public Galaxy Main server at https://usegalaxy.org, datasets are public but unlisted by default. End-users are in full control of specifying more privacy for their own data.
When working at a different Galaxy server, contact the administrators for clarification. Contact information is commonly found on the home page of a Galaxy server and/or included on known public Galaxy Server's directory pages.
